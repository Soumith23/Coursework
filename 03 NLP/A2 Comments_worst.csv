Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.88,"Been holding off reviewing this one because I was going back and forth on considering it a straight up light beer, which I rated it as. It is jut below poor and at the high end of terrible. It is extremely watery and flat tasting. If I were to rank it as a low calorie brew and solely as such, I would rank it at about 2.5. Halfway between poor and average"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.52,"Look - very pale/clear.

Smell - you ever smell a used beer can that you found on the ground when you were a kid? That's what this smells like.

Taste - fizzy and watery. It literally is reminiscent of tonic water or soda. Very carbonated.

Feel - worse than the taste or the smell is the feel. It's so bubbly and carbonated on your pallette it feels like a Sprite.

Overall - look, any beer that has it's caloric intake in it's name wasn't made to be good. If you're on a diet that restricts how many calories you consume this is a decent replacement for a regular light beer (Miller lite, Bud light, Coors light). The reviews of those beers will let you know you're just substituting terrible beers with a really watered down terrible beer though."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,2.36,"Had one at the golf course, and while it wasn't that great it was better than I thought it would be--good enough, I feel for a short review. So here's the review:

Pretty much indistinguishable from Miller Lite.

That's sort of impressive, considering its caloric lightness (which in beers such as Michelob Ultra and the other Miller 64 create a weird aroma that's like dirty socks). Grainy start, and a hoppy finish that is light but still discernibly hoppy. Totally drinkable."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,2.14,"Super straw yellow color, the usual mixture of a ton of a water and very little barley. Flimsy white head props up and hits the bricks right quick. Aroma of almost nothing.

Taste of almost nothing. Highly carbonated and watery. On the plus side, you can drink this and hydrate, without worrying about the water quality from some 3rd world shithole if you come across this abroad.

I guess there are no off flavors, so in terms of taste you can't dock it too hard, but mouth feel, jeez, its overly carbonated water that had some shitty beer spilled into it."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.92,"Bottle poured to pint glass very cold beer
Appearance: Light yellow, big white foam
Aroma: scent smell of malt, nothing else
Taste: not really great, watery
Mouth feel: very carbonated
Overall: good beer, repeat: no look for: no
drank:"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.28,"It's awful. I don't know why I'm even rating it. It can only be beat by Genesee Light, Milwaukee's Best Light, and Kirkland Signature Light. It's just bad."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.27,"This was like water in every aspect. MGD is already pretty sketchy. If I want a beer, then I'll have beer. If I want water, I'll have water. Palest straw color. No aroma. Barely any taste. Felt like water."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.77,"This CANQuest (tm) originally took place on 05-09-2010.

Another one that I CANnot believe that I have not reviewed previously. Anything in support of the CANQuest, I suppose.

First, let me say that when this first hit the market back in the late-1980's, I was a HUGE fan in its unleaded version. Regular was much better then its High Life counterpart and this beat Lite six ways to and on Sunday. After I toured the Miller plant in MKE for the first time, in 1992, I was hooked. Today? Let's see ...

From the outset, it had both similarities and contrasts with its leaded version (MGD). I got a nice couple of fingers of bone-white head with lousy retention. Samey-same. Color was a paler shade of golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Close to samey-same. Nose was still filled with adjuncts, especially corn, but not as prevalent. Pretty much samey-same. Mouthfeel was watery and there was not any real taste. It was so innocuous as to wonder why bother. Finish was mighty tasteless, stripped of any fabric of beer. Colored water. Feh. I might as well have had some water. At least my caloric intake was low. Sheesh.

This one's badge/patch may now be in jeopardy."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft 64,1.77,"Picked this and a can of Bud Select 55 up at a gas station for .50 Cents a piece. Any time I find a beer I haven't had, Even an adjunct, at such a low price, I buy it. Diamonds in the rough do exist.

Look - Drank from the can so I wouldn't know.

Smell - Not much. Metallic and grainy.

Taste - Not THAT bad. Cereal grains and a touch of grape with a slightly bready finish.

Feel - Light watery body with flat carbonation.

Overall - Why bother."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1.06,"(This is an old review from 2005. I had it for the 99 cal Bud Select but it was this one)

As bad a brew as I've had from one of the major breweries....I thought this would be ""added"" flavor being it was ""select""...it is not....it has little flavor and what flavor it does have is nasty...it literally tastes like I took a glass of water...dropped an ounce of Bud Light into and mixed it up...this has no redeeming qualities. I'd take a host of light beer over this that have more flavor....the worst purchase I have made in many years...stick to regular Bud if you like AB Macros.."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1,"If Eberhard and Adolphus rolled out of their grave this would be the first beer they destroyed. It's been said before, but I'll say it again, ""If you're counting calories, drink water or switch to vodka."""
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1.26,"It's thin, flavorless and odd smelling.
If you're that worried about carbs/calories, drink water, it tastes better.
Definitely not a beer lovers beer."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,4.78,I like light beers and I’m watching calories. I realize a lot of people hated the taste but I was surprised that this tasted so good to me. Light and crisp and I didn’t feel guilty drinking a couple. I don’t drink a lot so this works for me ! It’s is hard to find bottles and just a 6 pack because it wasn’t popular. I only find it in 24 cans which doesn’t work for me. Bumper
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.1,"12oz bottle - review from notes

Just watered down bud lite, basically. 2.4% ABV makes me scratch my head in absolute bewilderment: Who in tarnation is this beer for? Near beer that isn't near beer

I just don't get it"
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1.25,"Possibly the worst beer I have ever had. The look is light and not very frothy. The taste is sour and actually made me feel on the queasy side. With only 2.4 ABV meaning you would to drink twice as many to get to feeling good makes this beer an even poorer choice. Sure it s lower in carbs and calories but give me a break. I d rather drink NA beer because it tastes better.

Needless to say I will never buy this beer again. To call it a lager is a travesty."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,5,"The beer has been unfairly rated and I wanted to clear things up. I’ve been on Keto for a long time now. This is a low carb beer. It’s extremely watery. Think...La Croix: Beer Flavored. However, if you like seltzer water, beer, and watching your calories and carbs...then this beer does it all. Allows you to kick em back during the game with your buddies and not have to get out the carb calculator.

Overall: highly recommended for those who are carb or calorie conscious. But yea, it’s not gonna blow your mind with its hoppy flavor. I’m just happy there IS an option out there like this!"
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,3.63,By no means do I think this is a great beer ore even a good beer. What I like about this beer is that you can drink a case of them easily and wake feeling like you didn't drink (speaking from personal experience). Some will love it but it wasn't anything special to me.
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1.72,Think bud light that has been watered down. Straight piss water. Rain run off that has been filtered through old coins. Extremely light and most definitely crushable but honestly there’s not much to it.
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2,"A decent example of a low calorie, low carb beer. Pours a pale yellow color with little head. Aroma is of malt and something vaguely off-putting. The taste is thin and watery, but it is a 55 calorie beer. Mouthfeel is light. With a clean, thin finish. Not a great beer, but it beats drinking water"
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,1.9,"For what it is, Its surprisingly good. It has a faint smell to it which isnt suprising. It dosent have a strong beer taste, but certainly not a bad taste especially for 55 calories. It could be improved a lot with addition of lime flavoring which could be achieved by adding a slice of lime. It's super crisp and has no bad taste or aftertaste. It's not a beer of beers by all means but its nice for a long session when your trying to watch your calories."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.91,"(12 oz clear bottle, freshest before 04NOV19; purchased cold single... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: golden-amber liquid; fizzy white head on pour, immediately collapsed into thin collar... jerking the glass to and fro will leave a brief streak of lace, but it immediately slides away

S: faint honeyish malt syrup, little else - maybe some grain husk?

T: neutered lightly-baked flour product, carbonic bitter finish, odd lightly-sweetened cereal aftertaste... pretty damn bone dry, with a mild paper-bag essence on the palate

F: restrained sudsy sizzle; shapeless, tightly-drawn back-end to the body; vacuum-sucked out finish - rather notable overall tailoring of body and dryness

O: rather drained of flavor with an emaciated body; that noted, the overall taste isn't quite as 'watery' as a Natty Ice (1546)"
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,4.76,"I spend long days on the beach and this has everything I need/want (refreshing with good beer flavor) and nothing I don’t (high calories and alcohol).
Awesome beer!
Beer snobs will be haters...
Let them hate!"
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.21,"Here's a review of a beer had years ago. Tough to keep track of where your reviews went with so many online beer places these days (and difficult entities that overmod). Pours a similar color to that which you see in the clear bottle. Not a lot of grain here, gotta count those calories. Concentrated urine color, thin head eviscerates itself in the 1/8"" range. Barely discernable grain qualities in the nose. Lager yeast not there.

Taste is a highly carbonated light grain meets mineral water qualities. They didn't go hard, or even a below average amount with the hops. I'm sure they used some super high alpha acid no flavor kind. There is no there there. There aren't ""off flavors"" per se, but there is definitely a lacking of flavor. 2.4% almost makes you wonder 'what's the point'?

Nonetheless, the beer does seem to accomplish what it is going for. Ugh this is one of those double digit positive rate deviations for a beer I don't care for. Oh well."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.21,"this is pretty bad, but from an ice cold can, i prefer it to many of its peers in the same segment. its not metallic, its not sweet, its not overly cheap tasting to be honest, and its also not nothing, which counts for me, id rather have a little adjuncty character and a slightly appreciable lager yeast element than no flavor at all, and thats what we have here. drink it fast, because it warms up like garbage, but there are definitely worse beers than this. its not even that watery for how light it is, the high carbonation helps with that. i wouldnt make a day of it, but one in isolation is fine. it does start to taste like the can a little bit towards the bottom, and there is a decided absence of hops, even for the style, but i really cant hate on this too hard. one thing i like about it is that it does sort of taste like a classic bud, albeit a little lesser version, but you can tell its from the same family of lagers, and i find that appealing for some reason as i sip on this. more of a pounder than anything, not as bad as everyone says..."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.21,"Bought as a single at Old Chicago.

Pours a pale gold, small head of foam.

Smells light..grain, weird malt and hop profile, thank goodness it's light?

Taste offers no positive surprises. Taste is light and rather inoffensive. Grainy, hint of a hint of bitterness. Better than Michelob Ultra..."
Worst,Budweiser Select 55,2.07,"I love a good full flavored full bodied beer. That being said, I cannot drink like a 21 year old anymore and have some health issues to boot. Bottom line here is that this beer won't kill me. It's low alcohol content allows me to cut my alcohol intake by more than 50%. For what it is, Bud 55 looks, smells and tastes just enough like beer to make it work for me. Am I happy about it? No."
Worst,Natural Light,2.63,"12 oz can
Consumed 21Aug, 2022
Glass: 333mL Pokal [don't make this mistake - drink it out of its can]
Temp at Pour: ice cold


Look:
Clear pale straw yellow that is full of bubbles. Initial 4-finger foamy white head dissipates fairly quickly to a ring-and-island. Good lacing is left along the glass.

Smell:
Very mild but sweet biscuit dough with a noticeable lemon note. There is also a mineral or really a metallic note as well.

Taste:
Faint sweetened corn and light but syrupy malts. The mineral/metallic note from the nose is in the taste. A very mild bitterness shows up quickly. The sip dries out a tad at the end.

Feel:
Quite watery. Well carbonated. Body is very thin.

Overall:
A somewhat passable light AAL. It doesn't really taste like much. But it's cheap, it's beer, and it kinda tastes like beer. Fine for a hot day after mowing the lawn or at the shore (where other beers cost 2-3 times as much). Drink it ice cold, drink it in it's can, and don't let it warm up.

Also known as an ""Eastern Shore Cocktail"" in parts of Maryland."
Worst,Natural Light,2.2,"Poured from a 25oz can best by December 22 2022

On the pour a surprising fine white 3 finger head formed on a straw body with fine active carbonation. Over a few mi uses the head lost half of its height but I've seen a whole lot worse retention. Some light lacing.

Aroma is bad slightly farty, possibly from crap hops or rushed lager yeast who really knows I could be both based on the smell. Then a light adjunct sweetness mixed with a little BO.

Taste is better than the aroma but a bit of rushed lager funk is still there followed by a light but corny sweetness that fades into vague syrupy light malts. For the most part it tastes like it should.

Feel is a bit uncarbonated at first but then some sort of dryness creeps in and makes you feel like it was carbonated? A bit confusing and not the greatest. Definitely light tho. Medium to short finish.

Overall it is what it is. It's certainly not ""good"" but I've consumed much more offensive things as well. It's cheap it's beer, and it tastes a bit like beer too."
Worst,Natural Light,1.13,This is a beer that's a favorite amongst a poor crowd. I can't get drunk with it and all it does is make you have to piss all night long. On top of that it tastes like they used urine instead of hops in the recipe. I think I'll pass on giving it a proper review because it's not really even worth it. Remember the generic beer back in the 80's and the beer can was white and just said beer? Well they gave it a name and it's called Natural Light. Natural Light would be a better name in the craft beer business but oh well it got slapped on the world's shittiest beer and is forever ruined
Worst,Natural Light,4,"When it is 85 degrees outside and you are at a BBQ, drinking hazy, juicy 8% DIPAS that are all the rage right now is not prudent. On days like this, I harken back to my northern NE roots and reach for a Natty. There is nothing pretentious about this beer."
Worst,Natural Light,2.9,"Anheuser-Busch ""Natural Light""
12 fl. oz. can coded ""18NOV21NB0141""
$2 @ ShopRite #519, Phila., PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: Well it's definitely light in color. It's a crystal clear straw gold beneath a short cap of white foam that's dropping before my eyes. I made sure that I have a ""beer clean"" glass so it's not that. The aroma is sweetish, and although you can tell that there's some grain there it's not much. It's brewed with ""cereal grains"" but I don't know what they are, probably rice. I also think I'm getting more fruitiness here than hops which is weird. On to the taste... it tastes like it smells. It's sweetish, very mildly grainy, a touch fruity, and with minimal hop notes. It doesn't really taste like beer to me and I wonder why people who consider themselves beer drinkers drink this. It's like sugar water to be honest. It's 4.2% ABV with just 95 calories and 3..2 grams of carb per can which is pretty good, so at least there's that. It's light bodied and gently crisp then smooth across the tongue. In the end you can tell that it's fairly well made but it's definitely not the best light beer out there, at least if you want something that taste more like beer than it does a malternative.
Review #8,068"
Worst,Natural Light,1.84,"Well it’s been a few years since we graduated college and none of us have really thought about this beer in years. Yet here we are with a Natty Light in our possession. No one has ever considered this good. We all know this is the beer you buy when you need volume on a budget. Has the taste changed since we last consumed this carbonated water that has been filter through some old pennies? Absolutely not. Light, easy to drink and instantly fills you with regret. Thoughts of “I have a job, why am I drinking this?” Enter your head as you take down this metallic can of piss water."
Worst,Natural Light,2.55,"12 ounce can poured into a tumbler style pint glass.

L: Crystal clear, pale straw, one plus inch of stark white foam last about a minute before receding to a ring.
S: Opens nice with large grain aroma then settles to floral hops and lesser grain aroma, nose mostly disappears with the head, there is an occasional off wet dog-like aroma.
T: Very little flavor, light toasted ""grainy"" malt and floral hops, aftertaste is a bit harsh.
F: Highly carbonated, opens with a crisp bite, astringent mouth coating quality, thin bodied.
O: Below average for style in my opinion."
Worst,Natural Light,1.54,"There's a time and place for cheap beer in my house. There is never a time and place for Natty. Had some at a friends house just to have something fizzy to drink and it's just rancid stuff. Give me a Bud Light, a Coors, Miller, Corona, Yuengling Light, or anything over this junk any day. It's not that it's without flavor, but that the flavor is putrid."
Worst,Natural Light,4.04,"This beer is plain and simple. Crack it open, drink, repeat. Superior drinkability and decent flavor for the best price you can find anywhere! Not sure why guys with gigantic beer guts who chug triple hopped session hazy nitro cold fermented IPA’s rate this beer because you know what you’re gettin at $18 a 30 rack!"
Worst,Natural Light,4.04,I actually like this beer. It goes down easy and has a nice clean taste about it. Usually anything from AB I really don't like but Nat is good stuff. When finished mowing the yard this will be my take a rest beer.
Worst,Natural Light,4.4,"(4.25) Smell: Citrus, mild pine, loads of grapefruit
4.25 taste: grapefruit, pine, a mild yeast character (or malt?, seems more yeast), Citra hop
4.75 feel: a nice bitterness back of palate encompassed by a soft pillowy mf

Ovr 4.5"
Worst,Natural Light,3,"majority of craft brew losers will upvote a disgusting adjunct stout or ipa, but shit all over easily drinkable and affordable, quality beer. ready for the kids to move on to some other nonsense and let the craft beer fad die out. its about time. this lager is extremely drinkable and cheap. if u prefer a 18 dollar 4 pack of lactose infused ipa shit, go blow it out your ass and die. ukraine needs blood for the cashcows, sign urself up losers."
Worst,Natural Light,2.69,"Look, I'm not gonna get on here and say that Natty Light is the best beer in the world. I don't drink Natty Light because it tastes great. But it does its job, and it does it pretty damn well. It's the go-to cheap beer that I can crush on a hot day when I'm hanging out with some pals.

Tastes like nostalgia."
Worst,Natural Light,3.2,"C'mon, we all know what this beer is so why would anyone discuss the ""body, aroma, mouthfeel, nuances ....."" It's Natural Light and I'm sure we've ALL had it.

Look, It's not going to rank up there with IPA's or German Maibachs and it's not supposed too.
THIS type of beer just like Miller Light, Bud Light, Michelob light etc. is the kind of cheap beer you grab on a hot day after mowing the grass. It's has low abv, they're light, crisp and go down quick and easy. It's a basic thirst quenching beer and there's nothing wrong with keeping a few of these in your garage fridge for those ""I need a quick beer before I start weedwacking"" moments. If it embarrasses you, put it in a coozie."
Worst,Natural Light,3.26,"16 oz. Can poured into Imperial pint glass
Look: light straw, lots of bubbles, three finger head quickly dissipates to thin foam, some lacing
Smell: Some maltiness, more sweet though
Taste: Pretty straight forward lager style, a little watered down, a little bitter on the finish
Mouthfeel: Some carbonation, light mouthfeel
Overall: Pretty average. If you want something that is cold, tastes like beer, can find at nearly any gas station and not break the bank, give it a shot.
Not the best light beer I've had, bit not the worst.
Dont worry about food pairings with this one. It is too simple to overthink."
Worst,Natural Light,1.89,"25oz can from Grocery Outlet. Pale, clear golden, fizzy, foamy head. Head looked promising, then...poof...gone. Grainy aroma, adjunct grains, corn. Taste is sweet, grainy flavors with a slight vegetal character. Hops provide a quick sting then it all fades into nothingness, which is good because I certainly wouldn't want that flavor to linger."
Worst,Sharp's,2.25,"From Notes:
Looks like Miller. Smells like Miller. Tastes like Miller with water chaser. Then another water to wash it down. Feels too light to count as beer. Overall, I don't know. This isn't my thing."
Worst,Sharp's,1.5,"I didn't think I would have anything good to say about O'douls, but it's a damn site better than this. Even for a low alcohol brew, this is just not good. I really do not like the taste, and can't get past that"
Worst,Sharp's,3,"Bottle ran me $0.99.

Medium-bodied but lacking in flavour. Amber malt, 6 row/pale malt, malt extract.

Certainly drinkable. It has a nice albeit shallow flavour. A dependable nonalcoholic beer, but not something anyone would likely crave. Probably better than Odoul's, but do we really care?

High C / AVERAGE"
Worst,Sharp's,2.23,"12 oz. can:

Pours clear pale straw yellow with a decent white head and lacing for the style.

The smell is of... well, what little smell there is is of... not much. Maybe some grain or adjunct (corn?). Clean.

The taste is of... not much. There is something that hints towards grain. An odd chemical-ish something in the very brief finish.

Watery and not terribly fizzy. Crisp as tonic water.

There are much better NA brews out there. This has virtually nothing to it except water and some bubbles.

I had this on a clean palate and I am not congested. This is too mild, even for a macro NA adjunct lager."
Worst,Sharp's,1.38,"Look: murky yellow with a lot of carbonation.
Feel: fizzy, malty, and light.
Taste: sweet and malty, a bit like pear cider. Tastes like flat beer.
Smell: Apple juice and malted corn."
Worst,Sharp's,2.68,"Pours a yellow color with a lot of carbonation and a nice head. The smell is of grains mostly corn and the taste is the same. Mouthful is watery but ok overall it is ok to drink, just a bit to watered down for me."
Worst,Sharp's,3.93,Good beer taste for non alcohol beer of course I'm not real picky on taste as much as I am price. Paid about $10 and some change for a 12 pack of cans. It gets the job done.
Worst,Sharp's,1.56,"Here comes that weak ass straw yellow you've seen bandied about in several incarnations from Miller Brewing. On top of that, you see something that can't retain a head whatsoever. Aroma was of heat pressed canned vegetables and only the slightest amount of 6 row barley.

Taste gave up the water more than anything. Hops and yeast were barely perceptible. Best part of this non alcoholic beer is that its bitterness and almost heat like mouthfeel made you think not only was it harsh, but that it drank hot! Yeah, gotta say, O'Doul's smokes this."
Worst,Sharp's,1.95,"Poured from 12 oz can into a pilsner glass (my poor pilsner glass).
Right out of the gate, it's golden but carbonated and lacking a head at all.
Smelled of malt and maybe veggies of some sort.
Tasted like barely and carrots were dipped into a glass of water. No thank you.
Mouthful was thin as water.
Overall, the worst NA I've had, and I've had quite a few."
Worst,Sharp's,1.76,"When you think this style couldn't be worse than O'Douls, you try one of these when your wife hands it to you. Honestly, these shouldn't be considered beer."
Worst,Sharp's,1.55,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has slight malt hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent beer"
Worst,Sharp's,1.03,"this is some fabulously bad stuff.

it hardly tastes like beer. it tastes as though someone put sweet yeast rolls into a blender with a few cups of water and pulverized the stuff into drinkable form.

of the three US domestic NA brews I've tried, this is the only one that offended my palate enough that I won't give it a second try."
Worst,Sharp's,2.95,"Appearance : Pours a pale pale straw yellow color, bordering on clear. The head is 1 finger tall and actually stays around unlike the Coors N/A I tried last night. Lace is left on the sides of the glass.

Aroma : Mashed carrots, yam, peas, potato. A faint bit of plastic. Mostly just vegetal smells. Bleh.

Flavor : A faint bit of mashed veggies which disappears rather quickly and develops into more of a roasted fire corn flavor. Faint club soda and brown potato skin finish off the taste.

Mouthfeel : A bit more present than the Coors N/A that I had last night. Very carbonated, on the heavy side of light bodied, ends sparkling like club soda.

Overall : Not absolutely horrid, I could possibly get used to this for how cheap it is while I heal from my yeast overgrowth. Soon I'll be doing actual beer reviews again, but for now it's time to explore the world of near-beers."
Worst,Keystone Light,3.5,"You cannot beat a Keystone. I’m telling you if your looking to be complex this is not for you but for those who are looking for a beer to drink all day long at the beach and not gain 30 pounds this is it. It gets a bad rap for being “cheap horse piss” but seriously the flavor is better than most cheap light beers (the exception being Miller Lite which is probably equal), it drinks well and you can’t beat the price. And who doesn’t love the marketing genius that invented Keith Stone? I love good beer, I love craft beer and trying new things but when it’s hot and I know I’m going to down a pack or two I’ll always grab a stone."
Worst,Keystone Light,2.16,"Poured from an undated 12oz can

On the pour a cloudy completely white head forms which recedes to 1cm relatively quickly then slows down and receded to a decent cap over a few minutes, it never goes headless. Carbonation is strong on a golden straw body. It tries to lace but the ring becomes saggy.

Aroma is essentially all cheap lager off flavor. Likely mistreated yeast, but it comes off as a bit tart. Behind that is a hint of malt and corn. Very light and no real hops to be picked up on.

Flavor is similar to the aroma however loses a lot but not all of the tartness. Behind that is a slight bitterness and a sweet corny maltiness. Overtime converts to a dry finish. Not the worst but pretty boring. It's light as it promised.

Feel is decent for the pricepoint. Smooth and almost creamy from the head with a decently long finish, and once you get over the smell a pretty good crispness. Once again very light.

Overall a decent but flawed cheap ass beer. Pretty close to piss water with a hint of grain. For a light beer I'd say it's pretty good. It's been a long time since I've had coors light, and honestly I'd say this has more flavor."
Worst,Keystone Light,2.91,"I try not to be snobby when it comes to beer. Or rather, I try to meet beer on its own terms. Craft beers are trying for depth, complexity, and deliciousness. They hold themselves to an elevated standard - they're meant to be a great experience, not just a beverage.

Macro beer is different. Much like fast food is to fine dining, macro beer is designed to be cheap, plain, and inoffensive. Most macros, including this one, are just that. White bread and mineral flavors, no real head or hops profile, highly carbonated and refreshing cold. There are, of course, bad beers in the cheap category. Ones that fail to be boring, and are instead gross (Steel Reserve, for instance.) This brew, Keystone Light, serves its purpose; to be a casual beverage, much like tea or soda. A lot less sugar, so it's probably better for you than soda, actually, unless you're killing a case.

When I come home from a long day of work, and I don't feel like writing tasting notes or looking through the china cabinet for the right glass, I'll happily knock back a few cans of this, or maybe some Miller Lite, for a decent buzz and a deeper sleep. All things have a place in this universe, after all."
Worst,Keystone Light,1.63,"What can I say, it’s watery, tastes like beer-flavored mineral water. Goes down real easy, especially on a hot summer day in Texas.
Would recommend as a quick refresher.
Taste is water with some minerals, a hint of corn, and not much else. Almost like watered down Coors light. Go figure haha."
Worst,Keystone Light,1.14,"Used to drink this beer in college only because a keg could be purchased at certain gas stations for $49.99……yeah. It made for a cost effective beer for Beer Pong.

Goes down like water, has that metallic like taste of Coors Light (Keystone is brewed by Coors). Sweet smelling, light golden in color. Always left me with a terrible headache in the morning.
Overall, its bottom of the barrel Coors Light.

I cant imagine why anyone would still be drinking this beer if they are out of High School or college."
Worst,Keystone Light,2.62,"12oz can (dated June 8 2019, I think) poured into 16oz tulip. The appearance was the expected very pale straw yellow of the style, with about 1/3 inch of white head that had very low retention and no lacing.

The aroma was also as expected: sorta sweet, very soft grains, almost no noticeable hops.

Same on the tongue, just a bland, basic beeriness.

The body was the expected thin and watery that typifies the style, with a semi-sweet finish.

Drinkability was, again, as expected; fine as a quick lawnmower beer, and not much else.

Overall, we all know what this is. Nor surprises. for tickers only."
Worst,Keystone Light,4.42,"KeyStone Light is made by Coors Brewing Company.

The packaging is pretty unique and vibrant. It's not expensive at all for a 15 pack but I highly recommend not getting the ice version as it'll give you a nasty hangover.

The alcohol is standard but the flavor is pretty good. It's very light, almost like water with a beer aftertaste. It doesn't really smell at all. It has a light scent but nothing that'll stink up the place.

Overall, I do recommend this beer for the price and insignificant taste and smell. They're easy to drink and good for the price."
Worst,Keystone Light,5,Best beer money can buy. Absolutely cannot change my mind. Every time I crack a can I feel like I'm sitting on the summit of the tallest mountain in the Rockies.
Worst,Keystone Light,3.51,I have drank Keystone Light for years as my regular go to and it is average. The key factor over the many years is simply the volume I consume vs the price. the stuff is at least around here gets down to 10 bucks for a 30 pack compare that to many of the other domestic budget beers range from 13-17 for a 30 pack. If you are only drinking 1 can ever and not drinking an excessive amount on a daily basis I understand the current overall score of 45 but I got to say there is not much better of a beer for bonfires and drunk out door parties when your footin the bill on the tab.
Worst,Natural Ice,4.24,just a good all bargain american ice lager. Very smooth and delicate flavor. The snobs will hate it but its a great value and delicious on a hot summer day.
Worst,Natural Ice,1.79,"What sort of unfortunate turns of events led me to drink this? I … just don’t. Even if that’s all there is available. Although it’s nickname is “Natty Ice,” this was just plain nasty."
Worst,Natural Ice,2,"Came in hyped then let down. I guess PBR is the best unknown secret. It's hard to compare the full body of PBR to the competition. Drink PBR bro, aka Pabst Blue Ribbon."
Worst,Natural Ice,2.61,"Definitely not as bad as I was expecting, but not nearly as good as Icehouse for direct comparison. Some okay malt sweet bready notes in the flavor. The aftertaste was a bit bothersome - metallic and dry. Otherwise drinkable."
Worst,Natural Ice,1.87,"Pours and looks like an American style lager, but the head fades quickly. Nose is insanely sweet. Tastes like bitter sugar, maybe a Gummi that has turned bad. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone I like. It'll do, I guess, if your senses of taste and smell have gone dormant and you want a cold high alcohol beverage."
Worst,Natural Ice,2.98,"Natty ice!! Yes even anheuser busch on there website now refers to natural ice as Natty Ice. It’s a very budget friendly bottom tank beer that when drank ice cold is good. It’s not meant to be in any class of craft brews, but it does stand on par with higher price American Adjunts of higher prices. All in all for a ICE beer if drank cold like mentioned above it’s one of the best ice beers to drink"
Worst,Natural Ice,2.25,"From a 25oz silo:

Appearance: Clear, yellow gold, good head at first, then fizzles out.

Smell: A little barley, then seltzer and clay.

Taste: Mild sweetness, then some fruitiness like grape or apple that reminds me I'm drinking a mediocre high abv beer. Finishes with some nondescript bitterness.

Overall: Picked up a silo out of curiosity and for a cheap lager to kick off a football Saturday. Was a little better than I expected but not as good as an Icehouse or Mickey's or OE800 for a cheapo beer."
Worst,Natural Ice,2.24,"Look - poured from a 12 oz can. Pale yellow in color, with actually a sizable head that has some retention, which mostly dissipates after about a minute.

Smell - corn, syrup, and just a tad bit of funkiness. some alcohol comes through in the smell as well if it's warm enough.

Taste - when drank cold, tastes like just about any other adjunct: light, slightly sweet, and a subtle malty finish. however, if it warms, the beer really does taste nasty. in particular, the booziness really comes through, which is rough and reminiscent of gasoline. just drink it cold.

Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, and boozy for its type at 5.9%

Overall - despite the fact that I wrote a full review, Natty Ice really isn't meant to be analyzed. When it's cold, it drinks like any adjunct lager and gets you where you want to be quicker. however, if you sit around and start trying to pick out the flavors, that's when it starts to get nasty. Bottom line: it does what it's supposed to do."
Worst,Natural Ice,3.44,"For Ice beers this is my favorite. If we think of the context of what Natural Ice is which is a get drunk quick scheme beer is the best of all ice beers., It is CHEAP and will get the party starting."
Worst,Natural Ice,2.96,"Pours 10k gold with a generous but quickly dissipating head. Lightly carbonated, but then again I have this chilled in the mid 30's. Pale malt and a touch of corn dominate the nose. Though not visibly carbonated, there is a fine bubbly fizzation on the tongue, much akin to champs. Mightily crisp, clean, refreshing and quite satisfying, this quencher was far more enjoyable than anticipated. At 2 bucks for the 25 oz or about 6 bucks a six-pack, it's a bit overvalued, but nonetheless enjoyed it on a curiosity powered goof.."
Worst,Natural Ice,5,This beer is phenomenal. I love the smooth sessionable mild lager taste and the price is unbeatable. You just can’t go wrong with Natural Ice in my book!
Worst,Natural Ice,2.88,"This beer is fine.
The taste isn't really great if you stop and think about it, but this beer is not the kind of beer that's made to be analyzed. This beer is like an average main stream comedy movie. It's rude and too much, but it's just there to be enjoyed.
This is blue collar construction worker beer after you get home or when you legitimately want to get a nice buzz on after a hard work week."
Worst,Natural Ice,1.98,"The first of the month is here, and you know what that means. I’m sitting on my apartment porch in a lawn chair enjoying the best St. Louis has to offer. I’ve decided to go with the 25 oz format this time as I feel like I deserve it after my walk back from the cumberland farms I bought it from. The first pour into the glass displays a beautiful golden color. The kind of golden hue that my grandmother’s teeth have. The head quickly disipates once the liquid gold is settled. The smell has quite an inviting metallic must to it. Even though the scent of the evolving alcoholic fills the room, the flavor was a bit underwhelming. Essentially all bark, not bite with the taste. There are hints of spoiled apple and aluminum that compliment the stogie I’m ripping on. The feel of this gem is very light and dry like my work ethic. Overall, I rate this a solid 2.5. I can’t wait for next month, so I can treat myself again."
Worst,Natural Ice,2.09,"Pours piss yellow with a 1/2 inch white head; lots of bubbles. Not very much to the smell, just a little malt & straw. The taste is actually pretty good, it's not complex so I'm not about to try & break it down. But, it is full bodied & quite nice. The feel is light & pretty high in carbonation, very easy to session to say at the least. This beer is highly underrated for what it is, very affordable & I will definitely be drinking more of these in the future."
Worst,Miller 64,2.44,"Poured from the can into a standard pint.

A: Light fizzy and effervescent as expected. Pale straw color. Solid tight white head.

S: Faint grain. Typical cheap pukey hop smell from AALL type. Aluminum can notes remain.

T: Shockingly not as bad as nose. Watery and grainy as expected. I do not hate this ice cold on a hot day like today was.

M: Carbonation makes it so light that you hardly notice the underlying chalkiness, but it is there I assure you. Odd dryness with that bitter pill taste at ultimate finish when it warms up...did I mention to keep it really cold?

O: You might call this walrus piss. It is not intended to impress fancy beer palates. It is for long session days when you do not want to get arrested in a black-out drunken rage at the most redneck campground. You know, where you overhear comments like the jailbird neighbors threatening physical violence to their tattooed floozey for not getting them another beer fast enough. It saves you from that embarassment."
Worst,Miller 64,2.06,"12oz bottle, stolen from my uncle's fridge

This is so light it's barely beer. Very light scent and taste, badly burned corn and maybe an ethereal kiss of hops, like you can tell they're there but you're not actually smelling or tasting them. This is a bust, but on a low-carb diet there aren't many options

Bad even considering what it is..."
Worst,Miller 64,5,"Great Beer! To watch calories and carbs, this is the best tasting beer yet. I would/will drink even when not watching weight. Love the taste. It loses nothing in flavor. Very crisp."
Worst,Miller 64,1.75,"7/11/2021 9:10pm EST
Fort Myers Beach, FL

Poured into a pint glass

Look: Straw yellow (SRM 1) with a bright white and sparkling ocean foam head. Lacing and head retention are pleasant.

Smell: A faint hint of isolated oat and apple.

Taste: A shadow of traditional Miller. The nutty-like characteristic is present, but very diluted.

Feel: Very light and watery with a delicate fiz.

Overall: One could think about drinking a beer and it would be more like drinking a beer than drinking this beer. When the calories were cut, so were the taste and ABV. This is the opposite of a too high and intrusive ABV beer."
Worst,Miller 64,5,"Ever since Miller Brewery came out with this lower alcohol beer, I have been excited to be able to have the great taste of beer without all of the negative effects that I had been experiencing with the Miller Lite beer...
I also don't have to take medication for heartburn etc. I am having a hard time understanding why I am having trouble getting the Miller 64 beer! Please don't stop distributing Miller 64 here in Pasco County Florida, The Tampa Bay Area."
Worst,Miller 64,5,"This is my favorite beer but it is not available
At any of the many liquor stores in the Trenton/Hamilton areas. Alot of my friends drink this beer also and our private club cant even order.
What is going on with the Miller company."
Worst,Miller 64,5,"My fave!!! So sad I can barely find it now.... only bottles that are more expensive and in 12 packs... this beer is my jam! I can’t wait to have an ice cold can of it again!! Nice and refreshing, also great for someone that tends to drink fast! I chug everything I drink so this helps me keep my mind focused and still get to enjoy the fun! :)"
Worst,Miller 64,4.06,I don't understand why this beer is so hated on this site. It is just about the only decent low-alcohol beer available in the US. I like to be able to have a few beers at social events and remain unimpaired. Miller 64 is great for that.
Worst,Miller 64,2.32,"You ever get the feeling you're having a product for the last time, not because you aren't into it, but because its days are numbered on the production line? MillerSeltzer about to gentrify this neighborhood of beer. If Tomorrow Never Comes, will this beer know how much I meh her?

Just look at the dang color of this beer through its clear bottle. Dude, Who Spilled Light Beer in My Water? They go hard on the carbonation as this fizzes upward with the pour, but retention is like Raineer Wolfcastle doing comedy. That's the joke. The aroma lacks 3/4 of the beer components, and the one it has, water, well, its not supposed to be aromatic. And that's about the best where this beer is concerned: where it does almost nothing.

Taste is an afterthought, this is just meant to be something wet to consume after you run a 100 mile marathon or something. Or maybe you make an ass of yourself when you drink and you need these to keep yourself in check. The thing is, notions of malt, hops and yeast are completely lost on this beer. This makes Miller Lite and especially High Life seem like imperial stouts in comparison. Upside: not really anything in the way of an off flavor, just lacking flavor for the most part, mouth feel isn't heavy."
Worst,Miller 64,2.54,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Clear light gold, small head.

Smell: Corn.

Taste: Light sweetness, corn, seltzer-like dryness, watery.

Overall: Some friends had this in their beer fridge, so I had one for a review. Not bad for what it is--a very light beer. It basically tastes like watered down Miller Lite."
Worst,Miller 64,2.69,"(12 oz clear bottle, NOV0419; purchased cold single... poured into Stella Artois glass)

L: polished-clear, pale gold liquid; initially curiously lasting, glistening sponge of off-white foam - did leave a long, broad, crystalline band of lace at the top

S: urinal cake, delicate spicy-floral overtone; grain aroma like rye flour... like a High Life, stripped of its substance; not meant to be smelled?

T: grassy-bitter bite atop (again) a floury grain flavor, very subtle flash of cereal grain in the finish, but very little malt definition altogether; nearly bone dry... moderate peppery phenolic spice is all that's left humming on the palate

F: no definition to its thin body; mildly sharp and spritzy; remarkably dry with just that soft spicy warmth lingering

O: could be the glass altering the presentation of its aromas?... regardless, execution-wise a wonderfully dry, but more parching than refreshing drink; flavor-wise virtually flavorless - comes with the territory for a low-abv, low-calorie beer... one should really just abstain if this is what one's reduced to (1551)"
Worst,Miller 64,2.25,"A step above Red Dog, which once again is not saying too much. At least you will be cutting calories with this beer. It is a solid go to over Michelob, if that is what is available. Once again Miller over Budweiser seems to be better at times like those."
Worst,Miller 64,2.71,"Not much flavor or smell, but it will make an excellent golfing beer. Just the right amount of light and low alcohol to not throw off your perfect(bogie for me) game, but still be drinking a real beer instead of soda or just water. I dig it. Not gonna be a staple for my fridge, but for my outdoor style it fits."
Worst,Miller 64,5,"I am a sippy cup drinker. I put the cap on the bottle, and left this beer out over night. 11 hours later = still bubbling and no less refreshing.

+All beers should taste good or be enjoyable at room temperature.

Most beers are sensitive like soft red apples that brown and rot before done enjoying them, if you leave the slices of apple without the Corona lime added, many beers = #budlight garbage cans."
Worst,Miller 64,2.25,"The lightest I’ve had that I can remember. It is reminiscent of Miller Lite, but with that subtle savory soapy flavor to make it special. A beer that’ll have you more sober than you were when you started. A beer with so much water you’ll swear it’s a thirst quencher. I have three more and I’m looking forward to them. 2018/04/20"
Worst,Beer 30 Light,3,"Dude this is a light beer and the cheapest one, do since all light beer tastes the same this should be the most popular one. It was about 12-13 years ago (because that's when the 08 recession hit and I closed shortly after) I sold it for $1 a can. We started calling it millionaire beer cause everyone pretended they were rich buying rounds for everyone."
Worst,Beer 30 Light,1,"Have only thrown up once due to alcohol in my life, and this beer was the culprit. Stinks of urine, tastes like urine stirred with sweaty gym socks, and leaves the heaviest, nastiest hangover you will ever suffer from. Avoid this beer at all costs. The worst excuse for an alcoholic beverage I have ever had the misfortune to imbibe."
Worst,Beer 30 Light,1,"I usually would never give ANY beer this low a score but it is the beer I will always remember, not for good reason. I was in college and consistently drank terrible beer, weekly. The usually adjunct lagers and even worse. This beer was unpalatable for me, even when I drank BMC beers on the reg and thought they were good. A couple friends and I pick it up for a game of beer pong in college and left it sitting in the corner of the garage. It was awful. Try it just to say you've had the worst beer ever made."
Worst,Beer 30 Light,1,"I busted a party with some kids and they were drinking this stuff. Smelled like old garbage and farts. One kid said they paid $8 for a 30 pack. That's cheaper than Natty Light. They were underage so I had them pour it out.

Came back to that same house a week later for another underage party and the grass was dead in the spot they poured out last weeks batch. I'd avoid this swill"
Worst,Beer 30 Light,1.03,"Notes on this brew:
Brewed with dirty gym socks, and pigfeed corn.
May be paired with industrial cleaner to strengthen its effect
A bold drink for the new generation of ""trailer trash"" and college kids with no money
May be mistook for grape soda due to the ridiculous purple can. That's how they trick you into accidentally drinking it."
Worst,Beer 30 Light,3.36,"Look, I don't know what everyone is bashing...this shit costs like $10 for a 30 pack what do you expect? Golden ambrosia served in a chalice while angels whistle on your dong?
For less than $.50 a can, I don't think this is a bad beer at all; perfect for games and casual drinking (and I'd take it over bud light any day of the week). Is this a connoisseur's beer? Hell no! It's made to get a person buzzed and save a few bucks. The taste and carbonation remind me of Miller Lite or Coors light..leaning more towards Coors. There is a slight aftertaste which I don't experience in the pricier pisswater ranges...but honestly; I stopped noticing after the second can. Smells and looks like cheap beer to me! Mouthfeel is right up there with any other light beer. Taste is like I said, somewhere between Miller and Coors slightly sweeter and with a short, dirty aftertaste. Of course it's not top-notch, but look at that price tag! Red Dog isn't even this cheap most of the time and that's one of two beers (along with side pocket) that are undrinkable to me. It's not as sweet nor as nasty and off-putting as some of the ones that there are for the same amount of money in my area (Boxer, Lost Lake, Red Dog, Side Pocket, any HG product, Icehouse, etc). Support a Wisconsin brewery and save a few bucks while your at it for your next drinking game or beer bong-off.
For the record: Fav beers are: Alaskan Amber and Wisconsin Brewery's Porter Joe."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.25,"Looks like a beer, smells like a beer, taste like a beer, feels like a beer, and overall I'd say it's a pretty darn good beer for after mowing the yard on a hot day like I just did. And the price is pretty darn good for a six-pack of 16oz.
Don't need no ""fu-fu' beer just a real cold REAL BEER. Bottoms up!!"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.44,"Look of golden straw.
smell very fine stale open can from the night before smell.
tastes faintly stale. Not undrinkable just somewhat off.
Feels great. It is not overly carbonated feels light.
In Iowa and Illinois is 12-13 a 30 pack. Extremely cheap. It is a great party supply beer. In the same vein Keystone light is the same if not a little cheaper beer that is a far superior beer (all things considered). I can see why some people get used to it cause the cost and beer flavor but I cannot get past the stale after taste."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.3,All I can say is smooooth. If you want a beer you don’t wanna think about and sip on a hot day after working outside: here you go. Overall it’s a solid light beer you can have more than a few of.
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.68,This light beer for the money pretty good easy to drink taste like Miller lite and very easy on the wallet only other beer I rate close to this is genny light hands down better than Natural light
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.91,"Just like with the original, I am not a fan of this one. I do like mb ice, but not this. A little too sweet, goes go down easy though. Sweetness aside, there is not much in the way of memorable flavor"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.05,12 oz aluminum can into a plastic 16 oz cup. Very faint aroma but surprisingly decent head of foam. Staw/golden in appearance w/streaming bubbles. Highly carbonated. 15 cans bought for $6.99 at a local supermarket. Slight sweetness with just a hint of malted grains at the back of the throat. Clean and crisp. Goes down easily. Low abw makes it perfect for a drinking session. Refreshing and low calorie. Might not be everyone's choice though given the bias against so called macro brews. I think it deserves a solid B.
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.75,"Bought a 15-pack cans $9.49 Don Quijote
Light malt smell
Clear light golden color
Light mouthfeel
Medium carbonation
Slightly sweet light malt flavor
Overall what you would expect from a cheap light beer. Not much taste, but you could easily drink a lot of them."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,1.22,"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am sure some people like this beer, I love Hamm's so I cannot be too pessimistic about this one. It is still an awful tasting brew. It tastes like someone filtered garbage that was cooked and strained through used plant matter. Smells and tastes like yeast farts!"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.11,"I was attracted to this one because of the price, and the alcohol volume/calorie count ratio. This is about two dollars more per case than Genny Light (the cheapest light beer in my area), and has a higher alcohol content and fewer calories (more akin to its pricier cousin, Miller Lite.)

Look: Just decent. Lighter in color than Miller Lite, with a similar foamy head that diminishes quickly but clings to my pilsner glass. Better than Busch, Keystone, or almost any other budget light lager.

Smell: Nothing. Seriously, this smells like water that was poured out of a glass that once contained beer. Not winning any awards here.

Taste: Grainy, in a cheap AAL way, but not at all offensive. No cooked veggie taste, decent malt backbone for a light. Absolutely zero hop flavor, making it less complex than Miller Lite. Pretty good, much better than Keystone or any other competing bottom-shelf light.

Feel: Where this beer shines! Almost champagne-like in a Miller High Life kinda way. Excellent carbonation retention all the way through, contributing to that clingy head. No slick oily finish, as you get with Busch or Keystone.

Overall: Almost too easy to drink, and at this price point it's tough to resist. There are few better alternatives."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,3,"L - Pours a straw yellow color with good head retention and lacing. Not as pale as other macro light beers.

S - Sweet malts and corn with a little hops. Predictably less strong scented than Beast Ice, but similar profile.

T - Tastes just like the smell. Corn and malts, tastes like crackers. Hops is little more than a pleasant aftertaste. Watery like any light beer, but very grainy and refreshing.

Overall - I have had very few light beers, but this is a personal favorite in the category. Very refreshing and inoffensive taste. A great beer for parties or relaxing at home. Better than the ""premium"" light beers, especially Bud Light."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,4.3,"I grew up, my Dad would drink Milwaukee's Best light. Now being 26, I thought I would give it a try. I don't drink light beer regularly, so I can only imagine what others have to say about it ie: bud and keystone drinkers. To start off, this is a good overly rounded beer. There is not too much complexity going on in this beer. Smells yeasty like pizza dough which is something I like in a beer. The beer has no top notes to speak of. Just goes in the mouth vaguely crisp and you get crackers, light toasted bread. Very dry all the way through. No hopp notes or none I can tell. Very easy to drink. This is a nice beer,but I would spend extra to get miller high life instead."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,3.24,"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 7/16/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Solid robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and lightly sticky hop mouthfeel that is good. Pretty thin, but not watery finish. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.1%. Overall this is a decent light adjunct lager style. Solidly flavorful for the ABV. Nice clean malt/grains and decent earthy hop balance. Was a bit too heavy on the fruity corn notes, but definitely enjoyable for the style. Identical to regular MB with a lighter body, and without sacrificing much if any flavor."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Light,2.79,"This stuff is not that bad. No offensive smells or tastes. Just a simple, light American Adjunct Lager. My grandaddy and uncle both drank this stuff, so maybe there's some nostalgia there for me, but it is honestly worth a buy when placed up against other light beer."
Worst,Bud Light,1.97,"16 oz draft pour at a Twins game. Looks like a light lager. Smells vaguely of hops and malt. The flavor isn't terrible, but it is very watery. It was free. I drank less than half of it. No interest in revisiting this half-beer in the future."
Worst,Bud Light,2.78,"Poured from a 25oz can best by Oct 27th 2022

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest."
Worst,Bud Light,2.2,"how i have been waiting for this day. in ireland, bud light is a relatively new addition to the market, and where it is sold it’s usually sold in 4 packs. now im hardly buying 4 cans of most beer, let alone this, but sure enough today in my local shop there were loose cans, i didn’t really know what to expect from this to be honest, and to be honest it really isn’t as bad as i was expecting, there’s nothing particularly astringent about it, that being said it is some pretty cruddy lager, it’s just a vacuum of flavour, white bread malt and a faint sweetness, no bitterness, medium to high carbonation, reasonably drinkable but incredibly thin and watery, yeah it’s not good, but it’s not the worst either"
Worst,Bud Light,2.85,"The first time I had a Bud Light, I wanted a Bud Light Lime. You can do worse in terms of beer, I know folks who treat this drink with anathema. The fact of the matter is that you can consume a Bud Light and drive sober by the time you've finished a savory Mexican dish."
Worst,Bud Light,2.27,"Pours light golden with sparkling water like tiny carbonization fizz in lieu of frothy head. No complex taste, aroma or flavor to note. Not complaining since we are chilling and vibing at the Simi Valley Happy face Music festival with this “free” bottomless light lager “beer” include with admission. Better than water? Cheers!"
Worst,Bud Light,1.71,"Bud Light, the best-selling beer in the U.S. for some reason... It tastes awful. It's like a Miller Lite gone wrong. Just get literally anything other than this please."
Worst,Bud Light,1.43,"No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass. There's no head, no glass lacing, almost no aroma and it's one of the most transparent amber colors you'll ever see. There are vague taste references to yeast, malt, hops and alcohol, without any discernable hierarchy. There is some decent carbonation and it's blandly drinkable. Still, it's not worth the time, calories or expense, unless it's free. In that case, reread the other two reasons not to drink it."
Worst,Bud Light,2.86,"I decided to pick up a can at the LCBO in Ontario 473ml at 4% in Canada brewed by Labbats brewery.
anyways this bud light poured into glass with 1 finger head clear golden color good carbonation.. smooth easy drinking beer and very refreshing.
Didn't leave much of a lace but it tasted good . Labbats brewery did ok
I can buy this again"
Worst,Bud Light,4.16,"Very enjoyable.
Good for those days when I want to drink 3 or more beers without ""paying the price"" the next day.
Budweiser has obviously researched the ""LIKEABILITY"" of this beer before committing to mass production.
If you don't like Light Lagers.....then please have some respect and common decency, stop looking for a CHEAP TICK and DON'T REVIEW THEM."
Worst,Busch Ice,3.43,"It's not the greatest beer in the world for sure, but if you just finished mowing the yard, it hits the spot or if you're short on the green then it's the perfest brew. At $5.50 a six-pack 16 ounces I'll take this over the hi-faluten'-over-priced craft beer every day."
Worst,Busch Ice,3,"It’s definitely not awful. It’s not great or mind blowing but it’s a decent tasting lager that’s also really cheap.
It’s very light straw, clear, decent white head with surprisingly good retention.
Smell is sweet malt and mineral water, a hint of sulfur.
Tastes semisweet with a tart finish, not exactly sour but tart. There’s a slightly sour aftertaste that I actually enjoyed. This sample is from a 16 oz can.
I can’t say this would be my go-to beer but at $5.79 for a sixer of pints it’s for sure a good value for those on a budget. (I’ve been there before).
The finish is crisp and semi dry.
It also makes good michelada’s if you’re into those. There’s absolutely nothing better after you’ve been out working in some really hot weather. (Start with 1 part Clamato and 2 parts beer. Add Tabasco, lime, tajin, even some orange juice. It doesn’t have to be precise. Enjoy"
Worst,Busch Ice,3.34,"Anheuser-Busch ""Busch Ice""
25 fl. oz. can coded ""22102 WA1009"". Sampled on 7 May 2022
$1.79 @ Carool's Discount Liquor, Merchantville, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's a good thing I bought ""THE BIG ONE"" seeing as how this is rated ""Awful"" on beeradvocate. Ehh, it was only $1.79 and I got to get 'the eye' for going into a store in Camden, NJ that I damned well knew I shouldn't be in. (I know, I know, it's technically Merchantville - I can't figure out how that's possible - but it's a block away from what's technically Camden). What can I say, I like the weirdo beers and malt liquors! It's poured a clear straw gold body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The head seems to be holding pretty well so it seems pretty good so far. The aroma is limited to a generic but clearly adjunct-enhanced beer. There are no real hops, just a smear in the background. On the upside it's clean, but this isn't a malt liquor, it's just 5.9% ABV so I wouldn't expect anything weird. On to the taste... it follows the aroma which is a good thing in that it's clean, but bad in that it's fairly boring; t here is a little bit of an apple-like fruitiness to it though. It's lightly sweetish and thus nicely balanced by a moderate bitterness and generic background hoppiness. The alcohol never shows but then again at 5.9% it shouldn't, although it is possible, I assure you. It finishes mainly dry with a very short lingering finish. It's basically the same beer from start to finish except that you get a little more malt upfront and the apple doesn't step in until mid-palate. I've had worse European light lagers that have had more character to them but weren't nearly as well made, and then there's the beers from the Baltic region and Russia that honestly seem like they've been brewed with anti-freeze. Of course in parts of Russia that could be a selling point - 'Whatever Beer - Keeps You From Freezing!"". So we're basically done here. In the mouth it's medium on the lighter side, and gently crisp-then-smooth."
Worst,Busch Ice,2.38,"This one pours a watery looking golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like sweet corn and grassiness, and not much else.

This is certainly NOT good, but it's honestly not as a bad as I thought it could be. It's not as skunky as it could be, with just very little flavor to it overall - a mild sweetness and a decent crispness on the back end is about all I get.

This is light bodied, mostly clean, and very watery.

I expected this to be dumpster juice, but it's basically slightly sweet water that tastes like it's been left out for a while."
Worst,Busch Ice,2.15,"12oz can - review from notes

This is like regular busch lite, but with a shot of rotgut poured in. And you aren't getting much more ABV for how much worse this tastes

Rusty headache water"
Worst,Busch Ice,1.56,"I bought a can from the beerstore in Ontario 473ml at 5.5%.
my can was brewed by labatt brewing company in Canada.
it poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly evaporated and left a little lace but the taste was skunky not that enjoyable to me medium bitterness very slow carbonation.
maybe the one brewed in the states is better but this is awful I must say .
cheers."
Worst,Busch Ice,4.09,This is the best Ice beer in its class. All other Ice beers bow to this one. It has the best taste of them as long as it is cold. Of course there are better beers out there but for hot day after mowing the lawn this one is fine.
Worst,Busch Ice,1.62,"Consumed at Lake Timberline, Bonne Terre, MO on a rainy October night many moons ago. The appearance of this beer was average. That, however is where the niceties end for this beer. Smell was metallic and boozy. Could definitely tell this was going to be a battle of attrition. The taste was booze with underlying hints of green apples. Not good. The mouthfeel was seltzer-like on the tongue. Overall, I'd avoid this like the plague."
Worst,Busch Ice,1,"Assaulted by corn/alcohol smell first thing. Not very enjoyable. No hops to speak of. Cloying corn and GMO grains. If you are looking for a cheap buzz, do yourself a favor, avoid bush ice at all costs."
Worst,Busch Ice,1.96,"Super Beer World reopened from the ashes of Beer World in PA. Now that 6 packs can be purchased in PA, there have been a ton of retail changes in Pittsburgh. BW was the primary supplier to me during my earliest reviews. Yuengling, Iron City and the beers they produced were purchased from this HUGE case store. Reopening as SBW, with a few special deals and a large 6 pack section, I thought to go old school and buy a cheap case. Busch? It was one of the first beers I consumed. I've only looked back on it to review it early in my BA reviews. So, how bad could Busch ICE be? It was 10.99 for the case.

L: Bubbly like soda. Light head and lace. Light yellow.
S: Champagne? I mean, it is darker, but the smell, there is some sweetness, but it's not close to even cheap beer.
F: Watery. Minimal cream from foam. Alcohol remainder
T: Butterscotch soda with a champagne backbone. That is it.

Overall? This is the cheap beer I drank back in the day, only it's bastardized and made ICE. Busch used to be drinkable and likely is, but Busch ICE beer doesn't resemble Busch. It's just bad. If I don't throw them out, it's going to take time to drink this case. Maybe I'll drink it really cold after mowing the lawn."
Worst,Busch Ice,3,"25oz can stamped 18247 (approximately 8 months old) poured into a vintage Busch pokal glass at fridge temp 5.9% ABV. The beer pours bright golden tinted, straw yellow with nearly white head. The head fizzles away to an island and thin ring. The aroma is very nuetral. I get a hint of grainy sweetness. The taste is nearly tart, sweet, corny grain with no noticeable bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and undry in the finish. There is a little oily/soapy aftertaste and feel but it's not terrible. Overall, not as bad as I expected. Previous Busch beers were more flawed IMO. Not something to seek out, but it does it's job at $1.74 for 25 ounces."
Worst,Busch Ice,2.34,"I've already tried Busch and Busch Light. Figured I might as well go for the trifecta. The $1.49/ tall boy price tag didn't hurt.

Look: The clearest ice beer I've ever seen. Not unlike the other two Busch beers, with perhaps slightly more of a head on the initial pour. Not thrilling.

Smell: Faint wheat, grass, biscuit malts, wet cardboard. Unusual for the style, but not unpleasant.

Taste: Surprisingly decent. Most cheap ice beers have a nasty alcoholic burn to them; this one does not. It reminds me somewhat of Olde English malt liquor. Very smooth, kind of like the lighter Busch variants but with a little kick of banana/clove that does a good job of balancing out the alcohol.

Feel: Similar to Genesee Ice. It's lighter than your typical bottom-shelf ice beer, but still slick and gets worse as it warms up.

Overall: You could do much worse in the style. It's not a great beer by any means, but it's a good buzz for the buck."
Worst,Busch Ice,2,"Another ice beer that I used to drink 2 decades ago, but no longer cosume. May be the ice beer I like the least, hence the 2.0 rating. I don't know what it was, but it just never grew on me"
Worst,Busch Ice,3.72,"Pale amber gold with two fingers of white head. Splotches of lace appear as level drops.
Smell is grain bin musky grassy herbal hops.
Taste is grain bin light touch of grassy herbal hops.
Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. The finish is lightly dry and balanced.
Overall a decent Ice lager."
Worst,Busch Ice,5,To me it’s the best ice beer. Very smooth and easy drinking. Refreshing on a hot day after yard work. Just kick back and relax with one or two and you’re set. Cheers.
Worst,Busch Ice,3.61,"(25 oz can - THE BIG ONE - code 8290 WA1325 ... poured into a snifter)

L: perfectly crystal-clear, pale gold liquid; white foam on pour self-destructs, leaving med-thin collar, shallow island of bubbles in the middle... actually some spotty lacing; collar keeps till end

S: sweet apple juice, hay, mellow underbelly of cereal grain and masa... a fruity pancake?; soft hint of sweet esters... after sips, only faint, corn syrup/meal note cuts through

T: essence of an apple danish/muffin (apple, light almost doughy malt), just without sugary sweetness... after those first two sips, familiar lightly-pommed Kix cereal grainy flavor takes over... hints at syrupy sweet, but frayed-clipped on the back end, very mild watery finish... has similar vague phenolic banana note in aftertaste as Busch standard

F: lithe, comfortably light-bodied; nearly silky smooth viscosity; latent gas, but no real sizzle; mild perhaps alcohol 'legs' in the finish... just a dream drink from the glass

O: taste kind of straddles adjunct lager and malt liquor... not all that bad for an 'Ice', probably one of the better, more palatable ones I've had; dare say I liked it more and more as it went along... easily could have finished whole can, but will buy again!"
Worst,Busch Ice,3,"Served from 25oz can into shaker glass. Standard lager appearance -- 2"" sudsy white head, mild lacing, pale straw color, moderate streaming bubbles. Aroma -mild toasted malt and slight corn sweetness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, frothy with a crisp, dry finish. Flavor of lightly toasted malt, cracker, a bit of corn, with a mild hop bite. Overall: a decent offering in the style."
Worst,Busch Ice,2,"Pours out a clear medium yellow color. Head is white with almost no retention. No lacing.
Smells a bit like banana. Could be the corn. There is also a faint graininess in the back but not much else.
Pretty light tasting for 5.9 abv. If its really cold that is. The cheap corn sweetness makes its appearance as the it warms.
Mouthfeel is light to medium bodies with high carbonation. Standard for the style.

It isnt too bad when cold. But as warms watch out."
Worst,Bud Ice,4,"Darker gold than regular Budweiser. Soapy loose head that doesn’t linger.
Smells very neutral.
Tastes like bread, crackers, malted grain, very little in the way of hops. Crisp with a surprisingly nice aftertaste. There’s a little alcohol heat on the backend as well, probably from being brewed with rice or corn syrup.
I think this beer gets a bad rap because it’s cheap, it also makes good micheladas if your into that."
Worst,Bud Ice,2.18,"only picked this one up because a fresh batch of 18 oz bottles came in and i figured, hell i hate budweisers line of products even after a fair shake of trying them. so may as well try this one too, since im a fair guy. first one had no carb, had to go get a replacement, short walk. this one, carbonation is fine. heyoooooooo. tastes the same as the previous bottle with no carbonation. but with bubbles. ya these things are just beer for bums to get buzzed in a blaze of time. Which i think makes it good for what it is, im just not lookin for it. on the ice beer scale, lower in terms of choice, if one had the options of course. not everyone is as fair as i."
Worst,Bud Ice,2.25,"Poured from an undated 12oz can.

On the pour a fizzy soda like head forms then quickly disappears entirely. Carbonation is very lively and the color is a yellow gold.

Aroma is rough. A bit of green apple off sweetness followed by a skunky note and finished by a rough bad smell that I couldn't say where it came from. Smells like expired cider even ice cold.

Flavor isuch better than the aroma fortunately with some malts actually present. Zero hops however. A fuel and alcohol flavor is present in the very back despite only being 5.5% abv. Has the same ricey light note as standard bud. Not the worst, bit not good. To be honest everything leading up to this had me expecting worse.

Feel is light watery and has a lot of co2 bite. Despite all its flaws, when ice cold this beer is relatively refreshing, and some head does form when sipped despite being headless in the glass. It gets the job done but it's still not great.

Overall this is just a cheaper stronger version of budweiser. If you like bud and are on a budget this might be fore you, but MHL is the same price and scores better in every category."
Worst,Bud Ice,2.96,"If I’m picking one 25 ounce beer to drink it’s between this or Budweiser. Similar to Bud in taste beechwood aged with stronger alcohol at 5.5 percent biting on your tongue overpowering. Decent smell when breathing through your nose. Not as enjoyable, but better buzz in a pinch."
Worst,Bud Ice,3.64,"25 oz. Can poured into mason jar
Look: Light straw, four finger head, heavy carbonation
Smell: Malt and corn sweetness
Taste: Bready with a hint of sweetness, little bitterness, strange finish- but not bad
Feel: A tongue tingler, light mouthfeel without being waterly
Overall: Nor too bad, but not special. Drinkable."
Worst,Bud Ice,2.41,"25oz can from Fred Meyers. Every once in a while I dip my toe into the pool of beers kept at the end of the cooler. Those enormous cans with miniscule prices. Beers for the masses. Rating beer means all beers, not just the good ones. So here we go....I would say it looks like piss, but a lot of beers do. Weak golden body, foamy head fizzes away. Aroma? Faint "" beer"" aroma ( remember college? Day old beer can empties?) Taste is weak grainy, malty flavors, but nothing horrific. Just not much of anything. Easily drinkable, would quench your thirst for sure. Just not a lot of flavor at all. I've had worse."
Worst,Bud Ice,3.25,To those who pour this in a glass to observe the taste/feel/aroma that’s like trying connect your iPhone to a 68 mustang stock radio. Just isn’t made for that purpose lol. This is a good beer after you mow the lawn or need something crisp. A smoking beer or a game with the buddies beer. Would I drink it every day? No. Would I drink it when I need a low priced buzz? Heck yeah. That’s the main reason they sell it in 16 oz cans. Don’t drink this if you want a “fancy beer” or “reviewable” this is as common as a Pepsi and should be drank as so. Enjoy my friends.
Worst,Bud Ice,1.31,"This beer is get drunk, it even comes in 40 ounces so the teens who know someone who want to look cool on the railroad tracks or at a shitty party they don't realize that 40 ounces of bud ice is not how much you can drink but how fast. Ever drink warm bud ice? The ass end of a bottle? WOOF! I only bought a case of this because of the dam penguins and getting beer I was too young for during the early 90s ICE wars. Budweiser admitted that their employees used to piss into the vats. Now we know why it has such a bad flavor. PASS THIS UP!"
Worst,Bud Ice,1.8,"12oz bottle - bought this because it's infamous, review from notes:

This lives up to the awful legends about it. The best way I can describe it, and I'm not trying to be vulgar, this is just the best way to sum it up: it tastes how piss smells. And I wish I was kidding. Slightly sweet with a bite of alcohol, too. I don't know if this is a bad bottle, or what, and I don't care

curiosity satisfied"
Worst,Bud Ice,1.6,"Revisited this vile piss because l told my wife to grab me some beer. She must hate me. Looks is fine, pale golden yellow, leaving light lacing down the glass as it sits. Smells like, well, nothing good, really. Faint corn, stale wet bread, just not good. Taste is absolutely horrid. Slightly sweet, with an unpleasant bitterness. Not a hops bitter, but a wtf did l just put in my mouth bitter. Almost like someone put a cig out in this thing and put it back in the fridge. Mouthfeel is not horrid, and probably the best quality of this crap. Glad l had the opportunity to show the can to my wife and explain to her how she should never desecrate my fridge with this ever again. So many better brews at the same price point. Effing disgusting. Avoid... just terrible."
Worst,Bud Ice,2.98,It's primary benefit is the price. It's very inexpensive. The beer itself is easy to drink and has decent carbonation. The smell of it may not be the best but if you can get past that it's a decent brew. I'm not a huge fan of ice brewed beer but this one is acceptable to my personal taste. I recommend trying it. Even just once.
Worst,Bud Ice,3.36,Bud ice is the true godfather among the ice beer family. Doesn't taste the best but what do you expect. No other Ice beer goes down as smooth and feels as good as a few crisp bud ices. Best enjoyed in a bottle and with a pack of American Spirits after a long day. Has a nice vintage look that clearly has not been updated since the '90s.
Worst,Bud Ice,3.8,"People gotta remember this is an iced bud light, not bud regular. It's low in calories and flavor, less than bud regular but you get a higher abv with the refreshing bite of a bud a light. I'm down with it, esp from a clear bottle on a hot day"
Worst,Bud Ice,3.1,In the realm of ICE beers this is not bad the appearance is average smell average taste essentially like bud heavy with less bread taste and more of an Alcohol. Overall Average. I would not bother buying it for a party or any function. Would recommend just spending the extra 2-3 dollars a case and buy something better and crisper. For a ICE Beer I would recommend Labatt Maxx ICE over this.
Worst,Bud Ice,1.62,"Pours a piss yellow, classic among all cheap lagers, 1/2 inch frothy white head that leaves the glass quickly. Smells like straw & horse piss inside of a hay barn with a slight hint of malts. Taste certainly follows the nose, it is smooth, but it sure does leave a funky aftertaste. Full-bodied with a smooth finish. There is a reason why this beer is cheap & we all bought it for that reason. If it's ice cold it isn't all that bad."
Worst,Bud Ice,1.85,"Poured from a bottle in to a pint glass.
Appears golden yellow with a rocky foamy white head that dropped quickly to almost nothing.
Smells lightly malty.
Taste follows the nose.
Mouth feel is light.
Overall, there's better beers out there, but a free beer on a 100 degrees day? I would drink one."
Worst,Bud Ice,3.3,"This is the quintessential lazy summer night beer, the kind of drink you have with the boys over a bbq and a ball game. Nothing extraordinary, nothing offensive, just a clean and refreshing taste for those easy going nights."
Worst,Bud Ice,1.72,"Nothing quite singes the palette like that metallic Budweiser Ice flavor. Brewed for that fantastic can smoothness for an ice cold finish and a life ending hangover! After a few you’ll know it, both from the alcohol and the brick that is now in your stomach. The taste of a metal street pole will linger for a while, as will the masonry in your gut. Not advised for a drinking game, but it will get ya drunk. That’s about all it has going for it."
Worst,Bud Ice,3.62,"Ice cold (obviously) is the way to go for this one. This is my favorite ice brew edging out Beast Ice by a hair. Paid $1.19. Doesn’t smell like much and it’s smooth as hell. It’s kinda carbonated but not as much as say High Life. Give it a shot cause if you don’t like you’re out a dollar and some change. Drink it cold and you’ll enjoy it, cheers."
Worst,Busch Light,3,"My local wing place has these for $1 a can, 24/7. Love drinking a couple while eating wings and fries and such. Perfect pairing.

I wouldn't drink at home, but when had at a bar with friends and good food, can't beat it."
Worst,Busch Light,3.73,"I see all the low ratings and then some of the higher ratings since this is a cheaper beer.
Butttt….. for those people who are trying to watch their carb intake, have you seen Busch Light has only 3.2g carbs???? When comparing it to Corona Premiere and Yuengling Flight at 2.6g, and then comparing the price… Busch Light is a steal!!! And truly, the flavor is pretty good!!"
Worst,Busch Light,2.09,"Pretty bad. It's appropriately light, but has a grain profile that tastes like they used expired materials. There's no reason to drink this crap when Hamm's exists. Don't do it to yourself."
Worst,Busch Light,1,Terrible beer but not the worst I’ve ever had. I broke down and bought two 25oz cans on the suggestion of a trusted friend who has a similar taste in beers and food as I do. I still trust him but I have no idea what he sees in this beer other than it’s rock-bottom price. He told me that he buys this beer to give to house guests that refuse to bring their own beer due to its cheapness and that it’s a great lean mowing beer that “tastes like nothing” and doesn’t ruin the palate for drinking craft beer later. Well. It doesn’t taste like nothing. It tastes like aluminum. It tastes like the damn can it’s in. Next time I’ll go with Bud Light.
Worst,Busch Light,2.53,"It's better than Bud Light. This is as close to sparkling water as a beer can get, barely any flavor but still edges out some of the other light beers out there just due to how chuggable it is. If you just want to get drunk this will do."
Worst,Busch Light,3.78,"16 oz. Can poured into Imperial Pint
Look: Nearly transparent straw, Heavy carbonation, 2-finger creamy head which quickly dissipated, some lacing
Aroma: Bready, crisp, pleasant but one-note
Taste: Malt forward, not as watery as I expected, some complexity
Feel: Excellent mouthfeel, flavor lingers.
Overall: Straight forward light beer, has enough flavor to make it drinkable.
Pair with fried food, pasta, pizza and light cheese."
Worst,Busch Light,1.48,"It tastes good only after you brush your teeth with mint toothpaste. Other than that, it's pretty bad. There's certainly worse beer out there, but not many."
Worst,Busch Light,2.17,"12oz can

I really hate this one. The regular stuff I can srink fine, but this one bothers me. It's still drinkable, but has a lot of metallic and funk off-flavors"
Worst,Busch Light,2.83,Pours a standard straw yellow with a huge fluffy head. It smells faintly of sweet corn and not much else. The taste is near non existent with a slight sweetness. Its a serious slammer and refreshing. Overall a good cheap beer.
Worst,Busch Light,4.02,"Okay off the rip it’s extremely light colored, like the lightest yellow I ever seen in my life in a glass. Foamy head goes away extremely quickly. But here is the good part, the beer is very carbonated and goes down so refreshingly smooth. Second it has a nice taste very smooth/ lightly floral . ( beer has to be ice cold to enjoy) . Extremely cheap beer and super refreshing in nice weather not even necessary for a hot day. Beer is super drinkable this “awful” rating it has is not deserved at all. Not a bad beer but you pay for what you get. I was very surprised how easy it is to drink/ nice taste not a bad beer at all I buy this regularly along with other craft beers/ mass produced ."
Worst,Busch Light,2.11,"Pale white gold with a thick fluffy white blanket settling to a fine film and creamy collar leaving wavy lace.

I've not had many of these in my life--it might even be zero--but sitting at the Busch facility in St. Louis, I feel it's only right.

I get an actual hint of banana skin, a little tang and even slight sting--initially surprised that it's somewhat relatable to Miller Lite. However, it's a bit sweet and has a hint of ricey wax in the exhale, which is always a turnoff to me in these ""Light"" lagers."
Worst,Busch Light,2.25,"Pours horse piss pale yellow with a two-finger white head. Smells of hay barn funk, horse piss, & corn; also just a faint amount of beer. Taste is like water with just a hint of beer, but actually drinkable. High carbonation, light bodied, very crushable, worthy of a session. A bang for your buck is an overstatement."
Worst,Michelob Ultra,2.4,"Poured from a 25oz can best by Jan 12 2023

On the pour a 2 finger head that quickly dissipates to a small ring around the glass forms. Body is a light golden straw with active fine carbonation.

Aroma is better than a lot of beers in the category, but still very light and not great. A bit of a tart funk followed by a very very light corny maltiness. Extremely light.

Taste is again Extremely light but it is also extremely clean. Unfortunately it has a vibe that it is beer flavored seltzer as opposed to just watery tasting beer. Has some vague German lager notes but beyond that it's just so watery.

Feel is somehow nice and not too light. It is still extremely light but there is some malt in the feel and the head makes each sip pretty soft unlike an actual seltzer. Medium short finish and high carbonation bite. Still an extremely light feel.

Overall this beer is just about as close to sex in a canoe as you can get if you've heard that joke. If you haven't it's about the best example of ""fucking close to water"" that I've drank. Extremely clean however."
Worst,Michelob Ultra,3.08,Not sure why this beer is rated so poorly. It is what it says it is. It's an ultra light beer with little flavours. Pure summer beer to keep things light. Don't expect anything else. It pours a clear golden color with okay head. Corn/rice aromas and flavorist. Medium carbonation. My rating is based on the fact it's meant to be the least flavourful and lightest of beers.
Worst,Michelob Ultra,1.84,"Went to one of the local restaurants for some BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and fries. When we placed our order, the waitress asked what we would like to drink. I asked if they had beer and she replied that all they had was Michelob. Haven't had any in a very, very long time so I said, ""Sure"". My review numbers express my feelings about it."
Worst,Michelob Ultra,2.03,Pours light with fizzy slight head. Crisp and light lager “beer” at only 4.2% ABV. Bottomless brew at Happy Face Simi Valley music festival- better than sparkling water? Bottoms up - cheers!
Worst,Michelob Ultra,2.93,"Drunk during my trip to Silao (Guanajuato, México). Normal bottle.

Look - pale yellow and translucid with a 2 cm. white head and leaving traces.
Smell - citric and grain.
Taste - citric taste, but also light taste
Feel - light body with a medium carbonation
Ovearll - normal brew."
Worst,Michelob Ultra,2.23,Look is pale straw which I expect with a super light beer. Smell of sweet corn mash. Drank a number of these to be able to accept the taste. Very light watery feel. Honestly I drink more of this than regular beer because calories and carbs. I can think of worse beers to drink.
Worst,Michelob Ultra,1.87,"I bought a can at the LCBO in Ontario 473ml at 4%.
I have the one Brewed here in Canada by Labbats brewery smell and taste of this beer was not greatest it had no kick just plain skunky beer light below average beer would never buy again.
Cheers"
Worst,Michelob Ultra,2.25,"I was out with friends and I'd already enjoyed my first beer by the time dinner arrived, so I ordered an Ultra for my second since several others at the table had ordered this. The best way I can describe this is beer flavored White Claw. I'm not sure why so many people drank 2 or 3 of these with dinner. I'd much rather sip a good beer than down multiple of these."
Worst,Michelob Ultra,3.17,"Unlike some other pretentious beer snobs I'll give this a fair rating. Light lagers are the backbone of the common beer drinker. Nothing beats the refreshing cold crisp taste of a light beer on a hot summer day golfing. When I'm not drinking “real” beers, my go to crusher is Mic Ultra."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.8,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a murky tomato juice color with almost no head of foam.
Smell – As would be expected the nose is heavy of a tomato juice and clamato smell. Mixed with these aromas is a light graininess and a touch of mustiness.
Taste – The taste starts out with a quite sweet and salty clamato taste with a little bit of light breadiness. This pretty much sums up the majority of the taste throughout. Not good!
Mouthfeel – With the clamato, the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a lower carbonation.
Overall – Nope. Not going back to this one. I sometimes like clamato in a light lager, but this is over the top in clamato. Way too much and way to sweet and salty. It’s a no go."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.6,"12 ounce can, Julian Date 22056 (Feb 25 2022) stamped on the bottom of the can, not sure if that's the canned on or best by date. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy reddish/pinkish color with about an inch pink cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quick. Not much if any lacing at all. The brew smells like tomato juice, clamato, salt and a bit of lime. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some mineral and peppery flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating, smooth and enjoyable to drink. Truthfully, the longer I drink it the more I like it. I don't know if it's because of the clamato, but this is a big improvement over the Modelo Chelada I had earlier today. I'd definitely buy this one again."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.41,"24oz can shared amongst friends, review from notes

I can't understand why some like these so much... I guess I'm not big on clamato either but this is just non-potable... spoiled clamato and rotgut vodka are the dominating flavors"
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.29,I get that Bud light Michelada isn't for everybody because it's for people who enjoy Micheladas. There's a reason why their line of Micheladas keep growing to a half dozen or more. These bad reviews are obviously from people who dislike Micheladas which I find both humorous and absurd. Would you drink a sour or stout and think it's great if you hate those styles of beer lmao. Cmon beer snobs. Use some common sense.
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.06,"Picked up from a drive-thru liquor store as a tall boy for $2.99. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Thick, near-syrupy bright scarlet with a sort of opaqueness to it. 1mm pale rust head that disappears nearly instantly.
S - V8, clams, and gasoline. Mineral, almost like salt. Slight rice backing.
T - Heavy ethanol and lime notes lead way to even heavier clam and V8 flavors. Though barely noticeable, rice and wheat are present. Black pepper finish.
F - Viscous and barely carbonated.
O - Before I could make out any flavor, the first thing that came to my head was ""what the fuck did I just drink?"" For the sake of being 100% fair with everything I drink (and in recognition that this is likely an acquired taste), I drank the whole thing - about two and a half glass pours. First off, it's bad. Getting that out of the way, it's not as bad as you'd first think! It tastes like clamato and lime. Like a really terrible bloody mary. I should note that bloody mary cocktails aren't really my thing, but I get the appeal. This beer would definitely be better if it had some heat to it, and a lot more black pepper. Maybe some celery. I won't buy this again, but it's worth giving it a try."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.82,A lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. This is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market. The clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious. My only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor I sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better.
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.58,I’m typically a drinker of a Bloody Mary but I seen a lot of people drinking these and I was at a store and bought it and now when I buy a 12 I alway het 2 25 fl oz bud light Cheladas to start my drinking time I love em but should be made into a 12pack 12oz can pack or even a case I would buy more if y’all want 3.00 for one 25oz can.
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,2.23,"To be frank, the beer looks bad. Its a fizzy, milky reddish orange. It doesn't look appealing. The smell is that of Clamato more than beer. Once again, not appealing. The taste however is very reminiscent of a bloody mary. It is tangy with the herbalness of the tomato coming through with a hint umami. Not bad, but not really beery either. The feel is interesting. It is quite bubbly. It is thick, but not in a beer way. It coats your mouth and is hard. Overall, not sure what to think of this. Its interesting to be sure. If I'm in the mood for this kind of flavor, I'll go for a bloody mary."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.94,"Clamato and beer looks good together from an old Red Draw guy. Smells more like Clamato than beer. Not a bad thing. It tastes good too.You can chug-a-lug this stuff if you're a Clamato fan. Overall it's not fantastic for a so-called beer but with The Clamato is quite enjoyable as a Clamato fan, however the Picante version would be my preference in this concoction. From an undated 25 ounce can."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.15,"This is definitely an acquired taste. If you like tomato juice, spicy stuff, and or Bloody Mary’s, you are going to love this. I was skeptical but I gave it a try and it has become a favorite.pouring it into glass you get a sense of dread. Have you ever been to the hospital and looked at the drain on grandma’s hip replacement? If you have, that’s what this beer looks like. This pours a pale opaque red with a quickly dissipating head. Smells of tomato. Highly carbonated and spicy. Tastes of beer and Bloody Marys. I know this isn’t for everyone, but I love this stuff."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,2,"What in the world is this? I strangely gave this a two because of the tomato flavor. That is the only reason why? I find myself questioning my own integrity even drinking or rating this strange creature in beer world. If Short's can pull off a bloody Mary beer, the likes of which I have never had, then this is a huge stab in the wrong direction in macro world. This tastes like a dirty sock that you have worked out in dipped in tomato and lime guts. This is as refreshing as a dog's ass on scorching hot day!"
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1,"The only thing worse than bud light is bud light clamato chelada. I guess if you have to get your veggie servings for the day and are having a liquid lunch this would serve a purpose. For any other reason, stay clear"
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1,"I’ll have to go on my memory since this isn’t available in Korea. Pours a pink vomit like color. No head retention as this isn’t, strictly speaking, a lager. Smell is salty, strong hints of V8, faint whiff of clam and strong alcohol. Oddly enough very little in the way of beer in the aroma. Inspires a sickly feeling already! Taste...imagine pouring a flat beer into an expired can of tomato juice and adding a pinch of juice from a rotten lime. Why anyone would drink this stuff when they don’t have to is a mystery. Mouthfeel is thin, as expected, and the aftertaste reminds me of the watered down bloody Mary’s I used to get at Little Rock airport. Except those used to get me drunk. All this “beer” gets me is disappointed. Overall save your money and your sanity and buy a real beer (at the very least, an uncorrupted Bud Light). Give this awful abomination a hard pass."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,4.07,"Dense red liquid with a quickly vanishing head. No lace.
Smell is mostly lime and pepper.
Taste is Clamato lime pepper slight malt.
Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Finish is wet and heat from pepper.
Overall a quick refreshing meal in a can. Would be better with a couple of pieces of celery."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,1.92,"I was thirsty as I left the laundromat so I grabbed a 25oz. can. $ 3.50 with tax. I don't know why anybody could make a regular diet of this stuff. . I'd rather buy some fresh prepared horseradish and a can of tomato juice and all that good stuff (celery if not pricey)..with cheap vodka or gin and make my own.
Prepared horseradish and Worcestershire sauce and Mexican hot sauce lasts for ever in the fridge."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,2.09,"My group was playing golf the other day and one of the guys brought enough of these for everyone to try. People actually drink this stuff? The only thing I can say for certain is that there is tomato juice in the can. If there is a next time, I will say no thanks."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.39,"Pours out a nice red with a few fingers of pink foamy head that just dissapears.

Smell is sweet tomato and salt.

Taste is real nice clamato, salt celery and lime flavors. Not catching any ""beer"" flavors (hops, malts etc.).

Mouth feel is light with a crisp finish.

Not much to write home about for a Chelada but you can do worse. I kind of like this one probably just as much as the regular Bud Chelada."
Worst,Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,3.95,"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 8/24/2019. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Mildly increasing lingering pepper heat through the glass; pleasant and not overwhelming. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. Far exceeded all expectations, definitely one of the best I've had in this category. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Bud Light and Clamato flavors; with nice malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example."
Worst,Keystone Premium,5,"I have drank many different beers over the years. Iron City and Lite, Rolling Rock, Bud and Bud Light, Coors Light, Yuengling... and Keystone Premium is by far my favorite. A very nice balance of taste. Not heavy and bitter but not too light and sweet either. I pray that they never stop making it!"
Worst,Keystone Premium,1.59,Ice cold on a hot day and it was still disgusting. My neighbor handed me one out of his cooler while I was doing yard work. The taste is metallic and skunky. There are notes of corn and grains for something positive. Smell is very similar to the taste only less intense on the metallic aspect. Mouth feel is pretty much the same as water. Probably the worst beer I have ever tasted.
Worst,Keystone Premium,1.93,"Very similar to Coors Banquet, with the sweet malts/corn and hiccup causing finish. Only real difference is the alcohol is strangely more noticeable."
Worst,Keystone Premium,1.51,"Well here comes more of that urine and garbage liquid yellow blended with water. Doesn't for a head. A mixture of metal, corn, futuristic aluminum space ship alloys and molecular aromas your primitive nose wouldn't understand.

Taste takes on a weird subtle physical matter in the liquid aspect, water and sawdust from the corn husks used a malt. I don't understand what made this premium at all. More barley? Barf city. Notice I didn't talk about hops or yeast? Yeah, not sure they're here. Somehow this is worse than Keith Stone Light."
Worst,Keystone Premium,4,"Surprisingly i was able to find this. I had never had regular keystone heavy, so i tried it. Not bad. Relatively Average. It's good. Average beer for low price."
Worst,Keystone Premium,3.75,"Keystone Premium brewed by Coors Brewing Company, with an ABV of 4.40% Also known as Keystone RED. This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a smell white head. The smell is nice with some grains and hops at the end. This brew has look and smell of most American Adjunct Lagers on the market. The taste is ok you pick up on the grains. the mouthfeel is smooth with no bad after taste. Keystone is a little light for being premium. Overall I'm giving Keystone Premium a 4 out 5. This is a nice drinking brew I would get this brew again."
Worst,Corona Light,2.73,"I've been waiting my whole life for this. It's the first time I've ever gotten a Corona Light when I asked for it. I've never even seen it at grocery stores. Although, to be fair, I've only looked once or twice--but god damn, this was at huge box stores with massive macro selections. To be perfectly honest, I was damn near certain this was a hoax that didn't actually exist. So it was to my utter surprise that our local dirt cheap Mexican restaurant not only listed it on their menu, but actually delivered it to the table as ordered. Thus was my ultimate bucket list whale slayed.

The overall experience is, as expected, light, ricey skunk. However, it was also surprisingly toasty. I typically find the lighter versions of macro lagers to be the lesser of its representations, but since I have only ever had ""regular"" Corona Extra up until now, I'm finding myself flummoxed that I'm not entirely sure that Light is the worse of the two. Bottle to bottle, I'd probably take this over Extra. Even the lightly fluffy medium body isn't impacted too terribly by the ""lightening.""

To wrap this up, the appearance within a lime wedged bottle--which itself I find slightly less attractive than Extra--is otherwise lightly chill-hazed piss yellow with, after a tilt, a relatively active but rapidly receding carbonation.

Don't worry, I removed the lime wedge and serviced the tip liberally prior to this exhaustive review.

Enjoy."
Worst,Corona Light,1.77,Had this at a friend's house since that was all that they had. It really was offensive but I drank it anyway. Wow. I thought regular Corona was drinkable when really thirsty but this Light version is just not worth it.
Worst,Corona Light,2.62,"12 oz. can, best by 8/22
I spent twenty years drinking mostly Corona-Bud Light-Miller Lite, so the smell and flavor of this beer are very familiar. The game changer is canning. This is the first non-skunked Corona I can remember. So to start, the worst flaw is gone.
Clear gold with one finger fine white head. Spotty lacing, partial surface ring.
Corn, light floral, pale malt bready odors.
Not much flavor, light apple, corn, grass. It’s fine if that is what you are accustomed to.
Light hop zing, low carbonation , dry finish. Insubstantial, but no glaring flaws. Wet and alcoholic. Cheers!"
Worst,Corona Light,1.56,"What could be worse than perpetually skunky and corny beer?

How about watered-down corny skunk.

I never expect good choices at holiday picnics, but this is a new low."
Worst,Corona Light,2.25,how many ways can i describe a boring ass watered down corn beer. well it has a touch of hops and if you chuig these fast enough - you might get drunk
Worst,Corona Light,1.88,"355 ml clear bottle, ABV is 3.9%. The Norwegian supermarket scene has now been blessed with this masterpiece, hurra. Very pale yellow colour, moderate white head of poor retention. Fairly strong sweetish aroma, notes of maize, artificial candy and grass. Soft mouthfeel. Citric and refreshing flavour (kind of), a little hops in the finish. Thin and uninteresting as expected, but not disgusting."
Worst,Corona Light,1.65,"400th review/rating, friends advised me to have a terrible beer for kicks, here we are.

look: retained a one finger white head for longer than anticipated but quickly enough dissipated to a thin layer of bubbles, beer is a brownish gold colour with rushing manic carbonation in beer, clear of course.

smell: bad, skunked to bits, smell the skunk a decent distance from the glass to its pungent, very metallic, grainy, sweet, syrupy sweet, lime, some biscuity malt, icky.

taste: man that is poor, i really forgot what it was like to have properly bad beer, it is nasty there’s no avoiding it, not even snobbishness at this point, skunky, sweet as hell, like a malt soda, grainy, metallic, a hint of lime, no lingering flavours at all except some residual sweetness, poor.

feel: light bodied, medium carbonation, super watery, all the depth of flavour of a can of diet coke, thin nothingness.

overall: this drinks like a bad non alcoholic beer and for me has altered the benchmark on what i will judge bad beer on, worst beer i’ve ever had, if you like this beer, all power to you, but i implore you to try, like, anything else that is beer, probably better."
Worst,Corona Light,2.59,"Pours a basic transparent yellow color with a white head that doesn't stay long. Smells like skunk funk & grain! Classic corona. Taste follows the smell, not a whole lot there though since it's a light beer. This beer is pretty high in carbonation, thin, but goes down exceptionally well. Let's be honest here, this is one of the best LIGHT beers you can get, so don't judge this beer off of the best pilsner you have had; judge it for what it is. Garnish this beer with a lime & go get in the pool or mow your lawn & you wont be disappointed."
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.01,"Looks like beer, smells and tastes like urine with a metallic taint to set your teeth on edge. In the Worst Rated list on BA and its place is well deserved. Horrible! No longer abv 4.9% but reconfigured a few years ago into a 3.5% mid strength. I never tried the heavy version, which a few members rate moderately."
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.23,"September 2008: 375 ml clear bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.6%. Crystal clear pale golden colour, fizzy, with a big to moderate lasting white head. Moderate fruity aroma, notes of candy and citrus. Zesty mouthfeel. The flavour is moderately sweet with some fruity notes, minimal hops, bland finish. Not much to write home about here. Far from undrinkable though."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.02,"I recently reviewed Victoria Bitter which I drank for old time's sake by chance and it reminded me of one of the other beers I drank whilst in Australia; Carlton Cold.

I wanted to review this beer because unlike VB which I liked at the time but recently gave a very poor review, this beer I disliked even at the time so I wanted to see if it really is as bad as I remember.

My friend recently went to Australia so I asked him ton grab me a bottle so I could review it.

Poured most of a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass.

Poured a pale watery yellow with a very loose, low head that disappeared almost immediately. No lacing.

Nose was extremely disappointing. A faint hoppy aroma, some other faint but unidentifiable aromas. maybe chemical. Horrible.

Palate. Much the same as the nose; faintly hoppy and watery. No complexity or malt. Horrible. Probably worse than the nose.

Mouth was watery with very loose medium to heavy artificial carbonation. Horrible.

Overall, probably even worse than I remember. An almost unbelievably woeful attempt at brewing beer. Breweries that churn out abominations like this shouldn't be allowed to call it lager or beer. It should perhaps be called ""Carlton Cold - Adjunct Grain Derivative""

Absolutely horrible. Highly unrecommended."
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.95,"Carlton Cold is filtered below zero degrees celsius, creating a full flavoured fresh taste. The mid strength beer has subtle bitterness with a crisp dry finish, providing an easy drinking experience."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.62,"Format: a standard clear 355mL bottle with that old Carlton Cold macro label. I get the feeling that CUB has dropped Cold from being a full strength to a mid at 3.5% (as this bottle is) when they started their big advertising campaign a year or so ago. I used to drink Cold at barbeques because I was a poor student. Let's revisit it at 3.5% and see if it is any good.

Appearance: poured out a light yellow in colour with a continual swirling cascade of carbonation. Even with a fairly generous pour, very little head pops up - just a light white cap and ring.

Aroma: this has a smell? I got so close to try and smell it that I accidentally snorted some, which was both embarrassing and a bit of a mistake. Once it was clinging to my nose (and possibly my brain), I got wet cardboard and some cheap grains. Great.

Taste: a pretty damn awful cheap grain and corn adjunct dominates what little flavour this thing has. One of the rare few beers that actually makes me pull a weird face.

Aftertaste: drops away quickly with just a touch of sweetness coming through from the grain.

Mouth feel: light and watery in body with a mouth-filling carbonation. Not great.

Overall: for the sake of my many barbeque memories, I will assume that the Carton Cold that I used to drink 10 years ago (the full strength 4.9%) was less bad than this 3.5% that you get now. This beer manages somehow to be both boring, and taste bad. Most of it was donated to the Gods of the sink. It's only AU$40 a case, but seriously, just drink water or something. It certainly tastes better."
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.1,"Just a typical Aussie macro lager. Whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature, it is just so plain and unimaginative that I couldn't commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil. Basically water with a slight generic beer taste. OK for a knock-off beer after grafting on a stinking hot day"
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.12,"Honestly and without hesitation I can say that I used to love this beer.
When it was considered a heavy, in the older style bottle and before the $5m relaunch.
It had the crisp yet satisfying appeal but now that Carlton have sucked the the living essence out the first beer I ever tried I will never be buying it again.

All I can say is good job to the dickhead who thought that that was a good idea."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.28,this beers is crap when i open there is minimal fizz from the low carbonation in the beer its self. the aroma that comes out when first opened is putrid my fat chicks girlfriends shit smells and tastes and better than this and trust me i would know. give me a VB any day that shit is fucking holy water even better taken as a suppository.
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.57,"This is the second of three Australian beers my store has brought in, and is surprisingly the most expensive one despite... on here anyway, looking like the worst. I had to go for it though. My store, to make any sort of decent margin, sells this catastrophe for 4 Canadian dollars per small 330ml bottle, making it by far the biggest rip off in the entire store. Nobody even gave it a chance as a $21 6-pack. I digress though.

The beer honestly looks pretty nice - it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a copper-y colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table. Not bad on that front.

The smell is also not bad. It's got the standard adjunct smell, but it has some kind of deep, fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive, especially considering the beer vatriety. Smells good; looks good; what could go wrong?

Well, after the first sip, I very well knew what went wrong. The taste of this beer is just bad, bad, bad. It's a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion (no joke, it felt that way) of sour aftertaste. Going down the beer felt like straw... it was ROUGH, a term I don't even use much for heavy beers, but that is what was going on. 1's for taste and feel for sure - I can't even finish more than 5cm of the glass, it is just that putrid. Do not want."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.45,"Just a typical Aussie macro lager. Whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature, it is just so plain and unimaginative that I couldn't commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil. Basically water with a slight generic beer taste. OK for a knock-off beer after grafting on a stinking hot afternoon."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.03,"Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with this crap. Oh well, I payed a dollar fifty for this so I could satisfy my ""curiosity"" to find out whether this beer is as bad as I remember it.

A- For some reason, I poured this into my pilsner glass. Hell, I bet most drinkers of this wouldn't pour it at all. Looks like piss with dissolved chemicals on top that attempt to form a thin layer of head which dissolves instantaneously.

S- This smells like the result of blending a small amount of soap and a HUGE amount of water together. Unless my imagination is playing tricks on me, I can also detect a faint, bizarre metallic twinge which worries me a little. I do wonder EXACTLY what goes into this mass-produced bile.

T- Oh. My. GOD!! This actually tastes feral. The taste reminds me of water that has been left in a plastic bottle for a year- where the plastic has started to seep into the water. Hideously offensive, this is a true assault on the palate. Battery acid would be more appealing. What saddens me, is that there is no beer flavour of any kind at all. I tend to think that the label of ""filtered"" is refering to the ingredients themselves- that they have all been entirely 'filtered' out.

M- Insultingly watery and horrendously flat. I could have spent my dollar fifty on a bottle of water instead, hey, it would have tasted and felt the same. So disgusting that any chance this had of being somewhat refreshing is completely negated.

O- I utterly don't believe that people can label this atrocity 'beer' while keeping straight faces. This is to beer what Justin Bieber is to music: fake, mass-produced, weak and a disgrace. Yet despite all this trash talk about this *splutter* beer, I actually had a positive experience drinking this- it reminded me of precisely why I switched to craft beer in the first place. The people at CUB need to be jailed for fraud- or even better, shot on sight."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.16,"Pours a pale, clear gold colour. Not a lot of fizz crawling up to a fluffy white head that consists of visible bubbles, sinking slowly and leaving a frankly unappealing trail of lace behind that looks more like soap sud residue than traces of residual malt. Pretty bland, unimpressed.

The smell combines all the bouquet of a chemical weapons plant with the organic undertones of a mass grave for holocaust victims. Seriously though, it's the bitter alkali aroma of chemically-induced beer flavouring with weak yet syrupy undertones of sucrose. Objectively speaking, it's appalling.

Taste is actually a bit of a nostalgic journey for me. While it wasn't Carlton Cold, it was Hahn Ice that gave me my first ever taste of beer when I was about eight years old. And, like that first encounter, this beer also makes me want to rush, gagging, for the bathroom before I'm sick all over my mother's linoleum floor. Front palate is virtually non-existent with maybe some light granules of insta-malt dissolved in water. Bitterness kicks in midway, all metallic and alkaline with that battery acid component and just the taste of the inside of Carlton's ""big metal things"" that they use to manufacture (not brew) this horrific liquid waste. It's not even worth noting any more, because it's so far gone that it's beyond the boundaries of meaningful human reproach.

There's a bit more body than I expected. Not a lot of fizz and leaves without a trace. Yep, mission accomplished, it's an empty beer, suitable for downing by the six-pack before your shotgun wedding to your own pregnant cousin.

If, as Benjamin Franklin is reported to have said, beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy, then surely Carlton Cold is God's way of testing our faith. Unlike Job, I will not simply 'endure' this tribulation but rather take advantage of another of God's useful inventions, the sinkhole, and return this manifestation of His bounty to the bowels from whence he excreted it."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.53,"Filtered and chilled to within an inch of its life. This beer presents little to no character whatsoever.

Smell is non existent aside from the usual dull malt and adjuncts tones we come to expect from a beer of this kind.

Taste is again artificial and the high carbonation makes for a truly rough drinking beer."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.63,"A - like a beer coloured soft drink.
S - none, only more than 1 because it isnt offensive
T - halfway soapy, nasty.
M - the rating says it all
D - i wouldnt have it again, but then again its the cheapest beer in australia, so if i was drunk and wanted more maybe i would get it again."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.52,"Normally I would not bother submitting a bad review, however if ""Coldies' get enough of them maybe CUB will pull it from the market so that if someone offers me it beer next time I come over, it will be impossible that it is the only thing in the house.

It has no smell I can make out and the appearance is typical of a cold filtered beer (avoid at all costs). Also as usual for some reason, like all cold filtered beers in Australia, as soon as I opened the bottle it frothed over the top.

The taste? I would of welcomed it. Yellow water.

The beer may have some application of a 45 degree day, however I can think of at least 50 beers in the same price bracket that I would slam down ahead of this."
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.01,"Boldly going where many reviewers have gone before and ending up unsurprised. Had a hard time figuring out which beer to review, the labeling is very vague.

Pours a nice light golden color, smells of malt, metal and fruit snacks.

Flavor is incredibly light, very little going on. Very light malt, very light fruitiness, very watery. Decent carbonation at least....

I've had worse lagers, but I'd pick several others before grabbing this one."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.48,"Well im sure we have all heard it before but as im leaving work im asked if i want a beer so i reply yes and to my my horror yes its carlton cold i didnt recognise the bottle at first as they have tried a revamp on it and lowered the alcohol percentage too which is now 4% the beer pours a golden straw colour and smells mainly of water and feint grains,it tastes of water and mass production you can tell when tasting this beer that there is no love whatsoever put into making this beer,try at your own downfall i know i wouldnt waste my hard earned on it."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.64,"There's a good mate of mine who, when knowing I'm coming over, buys some decent beers. I'm happy to have converted him, even if he's just keeping me happy.
It's sad that he hasn't been converted for his own sake, as a recent foray into his fridge uncovered.
Carlton Cold.... the original Australian cold filtered beer, and one that I had not intended reviewing, as I would not part with my hard-earned money for this swill.
Cold, lifeless, bodyless. The best descriptor is ""macro-flavoured cardboard water"".
Avoid.
And avoid my mate's fridge, too."
Worst,Carlton Cold,1.83,"From a clear glass bottle (how do they expect that to help, especially in sunny Oz?), this beer pours a clear, very pale golden, like once, twice, three times diluted apple juice. It has a whole whack of puffy, airy, white head, that leaves some lacing around the glass.

It smells of very faint white grain, and, well, hard water. The taste is mildly sweet white grain - rice husk and mealy corn, and skank. Don't know if it's from the grain or any hops that might have made it into this waste of time, but I also don't care. It gets a decent score on the skank scale, actually, and that's because I have a recent Coors Light experience from which to make comparisons, and frankly, the Coldness of Colorado beats out the Coldness of C.U.B., hands down in this case.

The carbonation is moderate, the body pretty thin, and it finishes off-dry, with more of that adjunct sweetness lingering like a bad cold...wait, no, ok, pun intended...

Had to try this in the interest of Beer Advocacy and general ignorance on my part of Australian beer. Never again. I want my 7 bucks back, kitschy Aussie theme pub!"
Worst,Carlton Cold,2.14,"This pours a golden colour with a good finger of head. Some lacing and retention.

A nose of grains and some hops. I keep thinking about burnt toffee but maybe I am imagining it.

Some grainy notes on the palate. The normal CUB metallic taste is not there, thank god.

Reasonably crisp with medium to high carbonation."
Worst,Keystone Lager,2,"Keystone played a part in my high school years, chasing the bottled taste in a can. Unfortunately I can only find the light version distributed around these parts, but will snap this up and revisit with an updated review as soon as I fine the regular stuff, which apparently still exists."
Worst,Keystone Lager,1.94,"I had some hope for this one as a buddy claimed it was good. I don't know exactly what I smelled when the can opened, but it was not good. Unfortunately, this overwhelmed everything else about the beer."
Worst,Keystone Lager,2.58,"Keystone, as well as the more common Keystone Light, were common around here in the 1990s. Now, even Keystone Light is hard to find. Would be a good lawn mowing beer if available, though."
Worst,Keystone Lager,2.62,"Serving Type: 341 mL Bottle

A- Pours a decent enough looking Golden liquid with a sudsy 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.

S- Sour Apples and Light grain flavours.

T- Distinct flavour of apples and other odd fruit (even vegetable) notes. Not tasteful in any way.

M- Light body and moderately high (prickly) carbonation.

O- While not the worst beer I've ever had, I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to buy Keystone. Sure, it's drinkable, but that's the only compliment I really have for it."
Worst,Keystone Lager,2,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has slight malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Coors Light,2.76,"Obviously, it's Coors light. There is a mix of light bread and banana scents with a much cleaner finish than the competitor light beers. I usually keep this around for the end of the night when I don't want much more alcohol/calories but want another round. It also has a place in a large cooler for a summer event. Not a bad product for what it is."
Worst,Coors Light,1.79,"Bought at a supermarket in Algorta (Spain). 330 ml. bottle poured into a Pilsener glass.

-No foam head. Lots of bubbles.
-Herbal smell.
-Pilsener taste but very bodied.
-Almost no after taste.

Very dull beer."
Worst,Coors Light,2.23,"Had an original Coors beer recently and it brought back memories from the 60s for me. Got one of these to see if it did the same. It did. Not close to what I really remember though. Anyway, if you're looking for something light, this one will work."
Worst,Coors Light,1.9,"Poured from a 12oz can best by September 12th 2022 into a pils glass

On the pour I was pleasantly surprised by a nearly 4 finger head from a slightly hard pour. The dissipation is still fast enough that it goes down to a covering over top in a minute, but still I expected worse. Very very lively carbonation with a very pale straw body, barely darker than a champagne.

Aroma is bad. Watered down, and what is there is all awful terribly treated yeast. Has an old sweaty character to it with a certain metallic quality as well. No malts are detectable on the nose over all the offness. Straight failure barely has a beer smell it's just bad. Not disgusting like shit, but it's bad. I can see why it's called piss water.

Taste is thankfully not like the smell some malts are actually present, just a vague crackery malt with zero bitterness to balance. The malts come at the very end however and the rest of the beer gives a beer flavored seltzer vibe. Very watery even in flavor.

Feel is of carbonated water with much more carbonation bite than necessary. Slightly more body than actual soda water with some head forming on your sip but it's hard to get past the carbonation bite. Super easy to put down from the can though, for the same reason white claws are easy to put down, your body assumes it's just bubbles and water.

Overall you'd probably be better off drinking keystone light or even bud light. I prefer Banquet over Budweiser, but coors light is some authentic piss water."
Worst,Coors Light,2.78,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge, spongy head atop.

Aromas are defined by fresh cut hay, a spicy hop note and a rustic toffee sweetness.

This has quite a refreshing mouthfeel to it with a late, stony effervescence, highlighting the light body of the beer.

Tastes of hay, well water and a bubbly, mineralic carbonation, inviting a well working malt backbone to the palate. Has a subtle, yet sugary mid palate with nothing else to offer and finishes with a sprizzy, yet watery ending.

This manages to be light and refreshing, while unfolding a one dimensional flavor profile at the same time, making this perfect for when its effect is more important than the beer‘s actual taste."
Worst,Coors Light,2.72,"There are some instances when Coors Light tastes like the greatest thing in the world. When you need a light beer and you peer over at the tap handles and spot Bud. Then Miller. And then you scan a little further and see those mountains peering over the other handles it brings a feeling of relief over me. Of the big three light beers in the US, this is without any dispute, the best. Semi sweet, crisp, American piss water. How it should. I’m a sucker for a good Molson Canadian, this basically that in light form. We get it, light beer, piss, feh. There’s a time and a place for Coors light. It’s refreshing, it goes down like nothing and it doesn’t tastes like stale cat urine. That’s a win in my book. Love Train."
Worst,Coors Light,2.93,"I bought a silver bullet 473ml at 4%.
In Canada.
Poured beer into glass with 1 finger head but leaves a little bit of a lace as you drink it.
Very clear clean golden color good carbonation.
Overall an ok light Beer
Cheers"
Worst,Coors Light,1.38,"One of the first beers I've ever tasted many years ago. I described it as alcoholic water that's been soaked in bread.

Years later, I'd imagine not much has changed."
Worst,Coors Light,1.84,"So, I'm frequently prompted to drink this in a nearby neighbors' garage upon passing. I am frequently reminded that this is the very worst of all the macros, at least the popular ones. Surely there is worse beer possible, so I left room for those with my rating."
Worst,Coors Light,3.5,"It’s not a classy, sophisticated, craft beer. I know it. The color doesn’t give you warm fuzzies about it having taste. It smells like any macro in its class, nothing special. All that being said, I enjoy an ice-cold Coor’s Light. It’s light on the palate, refreshing, and not overbearing. You don’t drink it to impress or prove your knowledge of beer. You drink it because you’re a beer guy and it goes well with burgers or wings. It’s also nice to have while watching football or a movie.

It’s not going to overwhelm you with anything but you know what you’re getting. It’s wholesome, it’s decent, it’s affordable."
Worst,Coors Light,3,"I grabbed a can of Coors Light from somebody's refrigerator in California. I drank the can of Coors Light and wrote a review...

Look: Coors Light had abundant amounts of foam.
Smell: Coors Light had a chemical grainy adjunct beer aroma.
Taste: Coors Light had a vague flavour similar to carbonated water with hints of alcohol.
Feel: Coors Light had good amounts of fizzy bubbles.
Overall: Coors Light is a beer for people who will drink anything to quench their thirst."
Worst,O'Doul's,3.06,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into a smaller Antique Coors Glass

On the pour 1 finger of perfectly average head formed then recedes pretty quickly to a decent cap. The body is your typical AAL color with fine medium carbonation.

Aroma is like sex in a canoe.... after eating a single peanut, I can't pick up much of anything at all. At least it's clean I guess. Some slight corn way off in the distance.

Taste is stronger than the aroma but not by much. Super light but at the same time it is super clean as well. Some corny ""malt"" off in the background again but slightly stronger. Tastes like corn flakes steeped in carbonated water.

Feel is bigger than the taste and aroma suggest with the actual feel of beer as opposed to Budweiser Zero which feels like beer flavored soda. Medium short finish with a mouthcoating feel. Carbonation mixed with the decent head is a big driving force here.

Overall I wish Anhueser Busch would get it together and make a beer with the feel of this and the taste of budweiser zero, or at least make this have more flavor. If the taste was stronger it would remind me a lot of Tivoli Outlaw Lager."
Worst,O'Doul's,2.56,"This offering looks and smells more or less like a typical light AAL. It doesn't have much body to it, but it's also not too far from its alcoholic cousin. It's fairly tasteless, however, with a unseasoned, dry water cracker flavor with a hint of bitterness. Fairly lively carbonation makes it almost seltzer-like. It's really missing anything to like, but also pretty much missing things to dislike, as well."
Worst,O'Doul's,2.28,"12oz can - review from notes

Got this from my sober buddy, it was about to expire. This is Kenny Dennis' favorite beer, but I'm not a big fan. I've had it a few times and it's always skunked out, even if it isn't, if that makes sense. Tastes as green as the label

If I'm drinking NA beer I want either some flavor or some cleanliness. This has neither"
Worst,O'Doul's,2.64,"12 oz. Bottle poured into ale glass.
Spoiler. I am not a beer snob. My rating is based on the drink, not that it is mass-produced.
Look: Head was 1/2 finger thar disappeared quickly. Lots of carbonation. Color reminds of ginger ale.
Smell: Malty, one note.
Taste: A bit bitter, after taste not pleasant.
Feel: Good carbonation. Rolls off the tongue without leaving any lingering flavor.
Overall: Pretty boring, little bitter. But if you need something cold and wet and don't want the alcohol and you aren't in mood for soda, look for another NA."
Worst,O'Doul's,1.25,"Purchased as a six-pack of bottles from Walmart for $6.87. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Bright, clear gold with a two-finger pale white head.
S - Unbuttered popcorn and ""Honeycomb"" cereal. If I'm being honest, it also smells like someone farted into my glass.
T - Corn syrup, mineral, and a tangy wheat note at the finish. A bit dry.
F - Very crisp. Mild carbonation. Refreshing.
O - While being one of the cheapest six-packs I've ever purchased, this beer makes me think you get what you pay for. I think this might be the first beer I'm genuinely disgusted by. It's been proven that LA beers can taste good, so the excuse can't be the lack of alcohol. I will not buy this beer again, mark my words. Highly recommend avoiding this."
Worst,O'Doul's,3.62,"Light gold in colour, thin head. Smelt like sour grains and roast corn. The taste is very smooth and refreshing with an adjunct grain aftertaste. Tastes very good for what it is."
Worst,O'Doul's,2.83,"Pours clear, light gold in color with one third inch head. Smell is stale cereal. Taste is corn, grain, white sugar. Light bodie, sweet, moderate carbonation. Nothing I would get on a regular basis but better tasting than I thought it would be. Good for a macro style lager."
Worst,O'Doul's,1.71,"It is a pale straw color with a short lasting heading. The smell is that of grains, but lack a certain freshness. The taste isn't pronounced but is balanced with what little grain taste is there. There is no hop aroma. The feel is loose and not well complimented with carbonation. Overall it is simple and straightforward."
Worst,O'Doul's,2.06,Pours clear golden color.Smell of grain and wheat. Taste is grainy and watery with notes of malts and bread. ZThin mouth feel. Water is a better beverage.
Worst,O'Doul's,2.19,"From Notes:
Why am I writing this? It's not good. I guess beer needs the alcohol because this is rough. Looks like fizzy yellow beer, smell and taste are atrocious. Feel is like soda. Overall: yeesh."
Worst,O'Doul's,1,This beer sucks. I drank 40 of these and barely had a buzz... It's like drinjing water with a pinch of hops. Who the hell buys this and why? I mean what a waste of money.
Worst,O'Doul's,1.99,"Pours a clear light golden color with a 2 finger pure white head and good carbonation. The head dissipates quickly. The beverage smells clean with malt aroma, very one dimensional. The beverage has a clean malty taste, not much else there. The mouthfeel is dry and almost water like.
This isn't beer and everyone knows that, so you should know not to have high expectations. That being said, the beverage is not horrible, it's just not beer. I think there are probably better examples of near beer out there, I just have not tried any of them yet."
Worst,O'Doul's,3.67,"(12 oz bottle, 19157; purchased cold single... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: brilliantly-clear, yellow-amber liquid; fizzy foam on pour, receding to stretched, white collar... collar maintains, but all lace slides away instantly

S: granola and dried grass; bit of a baked, bready edge to the grain... overall intensity mild-moderate, but weakens sharply as it goes

T: relatively beer like (German pils?), little apparent sweetness, bit of cookie-like malt character in the finish; rather dry aftertaste with a mellow toasty grain and delicate peppery spice lingering

F: soft sizzle, fluffy touch to its light, lithe body... as stated for the taste, exceptionally dry - just short of parching

O: I believe I tried this once at least 15 or maybe 20 years ago, swilled it from the bottle... not all that bad, perhaps one of the better N/As I've had... would have it again (1554)"
Worst,Red Dog,2.32,"Wasn't aware this was still in production, certainly haven't seen it in NH in decades. We would occasionally dip into these for a change from the other equally swill beers of the day, rarely ever able to afford Budweiser."
Worst,Red Dog,1.5,12oz can. Can’t say no to free beer (but maybe you should sometimes). My father-in-law bought this because it had a dog on the label. That might have been the best feature
Worst,Red Dog,3.9,"(12 oz can, APR 2020; bought cold single at local basic liquors... poured into a 14 oz mug)

L: inch-high foam on pour, sitting atop a polished-clear, brass-colored liquid; the foam is actually relatively dense and glossy, receding surprisingly slow... holds a half-moon crescent collar and, dang, if there isn't 3-4 thick bands of lace - huh?

S: very pale, almost flour-like, vaguely corn-flaky grain smell dominates, mellow toasted note; mildly grassy-herbal overtone

T: apple juicy ester(?) up front, with a sudden surge of cereal-like (again, corn flakes), dried grassy/earthy grain midway; finishes rather dry with a mild lingering pils malt husk note, maybe a slight background tinge of masa; moderately bitter for its ilk

F: certainly a vibrant effervescence, bubbling and rumbling the center of each sip, with a few healthy belches as proof... the body itself is on the meatier side of light

O: first time having this in perhaps 25 years, last time being likely a lukewarm can awash in a sea of melting ice in a cooler at a gathering in the woods (or one of my other many haunts)... had no recollection of this being a Miller product, but given my inclination toward their brands, I could honestly see getting this again, even, just maybe, a 30 pack (I've seen em) (1722)"
Worst,Red Dog,3.08,Pours a translucent gold like any other aal with a white head that dissipates immediately. Smells like wet grain with a touch of just enough hops to let you know it's not a light beer. Taste is surprisingly better than most with a less apparent adjunct presence than other macros. This one shines because it doesn't lie. It's uncommonly smooth. This goes down maybe even easier than water. Overall an exceptional aal but I've only seen it once. Get it if you can.
Worst,Red Dog,2.46,"Our dog came back. We rescued him. We thought he was gone, but we got him back. It's the beer that your dad crushed at dive bars and Boson Garden. It's the classic 90’s beer and we got it back. Red dog. Is it good? No, not particularly. Easy drinking, honestly probably one of the better Miler products. Again, not really sure what that says. But this beer was bought for the story. The brand."
Worst,Red Dog,5,"Red Dog is the shit. 30 pack from roger Wilco in pennsauken was about $21.00. Looks great, smells amazing, tastes even better and then it feels so good. Red Dawg. Признайся!"
Worst,Red Dog,2,"Better than a lot of ice beers. That is not saying much, this is still awful in almost every way shape and form. The only thing that separates this is that it actually tastes somewhat like beer."
Worst,Red Dog,1.96,"I will give this beer one thing, it went down smooth. Unfortunately it is not as smooth coming back up. First time I got drunk on this, I puked. Thinking it might not be the beer, i got drunk on it again. Same result, I cannot think about this beer without wanting to retch"
Worst,Red Dog,3.22,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Score is based on the style.

Look - Weird and scatterbrained. The light background picture of the Plank Road Brewery building is on a weird slant, as is the bulldog picture, which is on par with all the millions of high school bulldog mascot pictures. The claim of ""uncommonly smooth"" is bold, and I wonder just how true it'll be.

Smell - Yep, smells like a beer. Very corny with that air of wet grain. Nothing much of note here, but nothing bad either.

Taste - The essence of beer. Like the smell, it's exactly what comes to mind when you think AAL. Very mild and balanced, sweet but not overly sweet, just enough earthiness without tasting dirty. Don't think I'd ever turn down a can if I was offered one.

Feel - Surprisingly little carbonation with a light-medium body. It truly is uncommonly smooth.

Overall - A random cheap beer that's good and hasn't been picked up by the hipster crowd yet? This is a true rarity."
Worst,Red Dog,3.68,"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/4/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice pale adjunct lager. All around nice obustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Very clean pale malt/grain flavors, and nice earthy hop presence for the style. Really nice barley presence, and not overdone on adjuncts at all. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example as expected of Miller."
Worst,Red Dog,2.19,"Appearance – Clear yellow beer with a thin layer of head.

Aroma – Light hoppiness but not very distinctive.

Taste – Funky, like a draft beer in a keg. Not sour funky, more like a little old or lightstruck.

Mouthfeel – Somewhat thin.

Overall – Not a great beer by any means"
Worst,Sleeman Clear,1.18,"Without a doubt, the worst beer ever created by man! Carbonated water with some light colour added is the best description of this flavourless thin weak excuse for a beer. Simply dreadful. After the first bottle I ended up pouring the rest down the drain hoping that it might clear the pipes. Pitiful, just awful. It’s a shame when Sleemans brews some really good beers."
Worst,Sleeman Clear,4.25,"For light beers it is a excellent choice... It's crisp, light & refreshing...
If you don't like light beer, well than not for you.
This is a good refreshing beer!
Cheers!"
Worst,Sleeman Clear,3.36,"You have to rate this beer within it’s category. It’s a low cal, low carb, light beer. In that category, the main thing I would look for is taste/calories vs. alcohol content. Compared to other in its category, i.e: Bud Light, Miller Light, I think it holds up very well (although maybe not with the same type of marketing). The taste is crisp, carbonated, without a terrible aftertaste; although it does taste a little chemically/processed at the end of the draw. All in all, although it may get labeled as kind of lame for being ‘low carb’, I thinks it a fine beer in its category. If you want to drink a six pack watching a hockey game on a weeknight, get a good buzz, and not pay for the calories, it’s a decent choice!"
Worst,Sleeman Clear,1.75,"L: Piss

S: See above

T: Just the same

F: Way to much carbination

O: Not very good at all but I drank it cuz that's all I had :( It only tastes alright when super cold."
Worst,Sleeman Clear,3.75,"it was very smooth taste. I found that it didn't have any after taste. the beer was very smooth and not bitter, at all. I had a medium week buzz after two beers, witch is all I drank. this beer is very good and I recommend it."
Worst,Sleeman Clear,2.75,"It is true what the other reviewers wrote when comparing Sleeman's Clear to what is expected of a great beer. This beer, however, is designed to be low carb (2.5g) and low calorie (90) and not meant to be rated against a great beer. If you compare Sleeman's Clear against others in it's weight class, it is one of the better beers and is quite reasonably priced in Ontario, where I am from and where it is brewed. It is a long hockey season... good beers have 10x the carbs and 3x the calories at least... we want to be able to move off the couch next spring. Cheers"
Worst,Sleeman Clear,2.3,"473 mL can from TBS; packaged June 14 2013. Now labelled as 'Sleeman Clear 2.0', although as far as I can tell nothing about the recipe seems to have changed from the earlier iteration. When considering all of the (formerly) Canadian macros, I generally place Sleeman a notch above the other two - but Sleeman Clear is a turd that has been floating in the punchbowl for at least 10 years now, and I can only assume that there is a very good reason for its score being so low. Served ice cold.

An aggressive pour reveals a pale straw yellow-coloured liquid, topped with one finger of fizzy white head that wastes no time while fizzling itself out of existence. Nothing remains on the surface; it basically looks like apple juice. The aroma is bland, but it manages to avoid outright unpleasantness by being so weak and limp that it's barely even noticeable in the first place. A faint wisp of corn husks, damp grains and apples are the only real descriptors I can manage. For a light lager, it's not that bad, I guess, but it leaves much to be desired.

Not much to report in the taste department either - not very grainy, but corn grist is a strong contributor, and that cardboard flavour I often find in cheap/light/ice beers is fairly noticeable. Dry finish that really reminds me of club soda, in that it has no discernible features whatsoever beyond being carbonated. Thin and very watery, with firm carbonation that provides this beer with a solid bite. It's easy enough to drink quickly, and I can't think of any compelling reasons to take your time with it.

Final Grade: 2.3, a to-be-avoided D grade. Sleeman may find that it will take more than a '2.0' slapped onto the label to convince those that were less-than-impressed with the 'alpha' version of Sleeman Clear that this purported upgrade is worth a try. Let's be frank - this is a brew that I have seen (exclusive) light beer drinkers turn their nose up at on several occasions. This is not a very good light beer, being even more watery and flavourless than old staples like Bud/Coors Light. If you hate the taste of beer but still want to drink it for some reason, Sleeman Clear is your brew; otherwise, stick with one of the more well known light macros. Hell, Sleeman Light is orders of magnitude better than this."
Worst,Sleeman Clear,1.78,"Yes, it is a pretty awful and flavourless ""beer""... but what really can you expect for under 100 calories. It tastes like water but honestly I still think it tastes better than coors, canadian or bud light because at least it doesn't taste like skunk water"
Worst,Sleeman Clear,1.92,"Revisited this beer a couple nights ago, as I was offered and wanted to see if it was as bad as I thought it was. Labelled as Sleeman clear 2.0, not sure if the recipe changed, but I couldn't tell much of a difference.

Appearance - Very pale golden color, a little bit anemic looking, had it from the bottle but my guess is you wouldn't get much head on this beer. Clear with minimal carbonation.

Smell - A faint grainy aroma is all I can pick up. Nothing strange but not much of anything. AAL's smell extremely aromatic compared to this.

Taste - There's nothing off here, but there's just well nothing here at all. Tastes light water, with a slight lagery additive.

Mouthfeel -Limp and light.

Overall - I know light lagers are supposed to be light, but at least most of them sort of have some flavor. It's better than I remember, but that's about all I can positive."

Worst,Keystone Ice,1.44,"Pounder can from the clearance aisle. Actually looks pretty good. But looks can be deceiving. And they are. Nasty, musty, pasty aroma, wet paper smell.

The beautiful foamy head is the lone saving grace, and that disappears pretty quickly. Hobo piss indeed. And I thought Nigeria Pal was bad...."
Worst,Budweiser Select,1.7,Pours a very pale yellow color with a very small white head. It has the taste of a beer .. sort of .. when you drink one ice cold and are dying of thirst. Haven't had one in years and now I remember why. Blah.
Worst,Budweiser Select,3.5,"This is my favorite backyard all-nighter beer. In my fridge you find 3 types of beer: a Stout buy-of-the-week, miller lite, Budweiser Select. Love Budweiser Select can't complain. Full of memories of the good ole college years where we all chip in to buy a 24-pk or two."

Not feeling this one"
Worst,Budweiser Select,3.25,"25oz can stamped 20NOV21 poured into a pint glass at fridge temp 4.3% ABV. The beer pours bright very light gold in color with minimal nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. The aroma is faint with a minerally vegetable note. The taste is barely sweet and tart with a mild toasted malt note and plenty of movie popcorn butter. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, ok. It's nice that they put some toasted malt in this beer, but the vegetable and butter notes are too much to forgive."
Worst,Budweiser Select,2.29,"Lightly chill hazed pale amber with a persistent off-white creamy head leaving fine curtains on the glass.

Oh, so it's a less-light Bud Light--just a little toastier, and less ricey, waxy or sweet of grape notes. Unfortunately, while slightly reduced, those notes are all still there, accompanied by a slightly more present touch of bread that's missing from the lighter brother.

The medium body is fluffy but wet."
Worst,Budweiser Select,5,"This beer is great. It’s one of, if not my favorite beer. The taste isn’t too strong, so for the novice beer drinker it’s a great choice. It is very refreshing and goes down easy. Not very filling, and easy to drink! I hope that Budweiser does not stop the production of this beer because it is one of kind and I have very fond memories of drinking this with my friends. I highly recommend this beer."
Worst,Budweiser Select,2.48,"Gold in color with excellent clarity and plenty of carbonation bubbles. There’s a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a quarter of the top.

Worst,Budweiser Select,4.82,"This is a good beer. An “Awful rating” just isn’t accurate or appropriate. This beer tastes good.... light .... crisp... session able ... and great with family and friends..

When I first drank it I thought of iced tea, they managed to get the flavor without the body.

Worst,Budweiser Select,2.95,"This one's got some noble hops in the nose, plus a little caramel. The flavor has a hint of toast with pilsner malt. It's got a bit of flavor but watery as fuck."
Worst,Budweiser Select,2.5,"Of the Budweiser products probably one of the better ones. The black can at least makes you look a bit cool when drinking it. If you find one fresh, cold, it's probably better than average"

Worst,Budweiser Select,2.15,Quite possibly my least favorite from the Bud family. Had it on a few occasions and always thought it was kind of skunky. Always just tasted off. Just a notch above poor
Worst,Budweiser Select,3.3,"BOTTLE:

I'm finding this surprisingly flavorful for a light lager of 99kcal, and surprisingly flavorful even compared to regular Budweiser. The caramel malt actually comes through in its taste, giving it a more diverse malt backbone than comparable light lagers with a bit more sweetness and body. Refreshing and nicely balanced, with a glimmer of floral hop flavour working its way in in addition to the usual grassiness.

Not watery or syrupy, nor is it redolent of any off-flavours (or overt adjunct). You can't say that about many value beers, let alone light lagers (so many are shallow simple watery garbage).

I don't see how one couldn't rate this at least above average in terms of the style; it's got more complexity and better balance than most I've tried. In terms of sheer flavor to kCal ratio, it's pretty strong (though Guinness probably wins out). I can imagine it better, but all in all it's rather well executed for what it is. I imagine many raters are just knocking it for being an AB-InBev product; I quite like it and definitely want another in this sitting.

Low B- / WORTHY"

Worst,Busch Beer,2.31,"Poured from an undated 12oz can

On the pour a big 3+ finger head forms in my pint glass that actually looks pretty nice but it quickly fades down allowing me to fit the whole can no problem. Over a couple minutes the head fades to a ring around the glass and some light carbonation floating on tip. Body is very carbonated and a golden yellow. On the first sip it tries to form lacing but it quickly sags to become just some clusters of bubbles stuck to the glass.

Aroma is basically all tart cheap unpleasant poorly treated lager yeast. There's maybe a slight hint of hops, maybe and a very light hint of corny maltiness on the back.

Flavor largely follows the aroma woth the tartness sticking around and essentially no bitterness the finish is a vaguely sweet corny light malt. Pretty simple and not great.

Feel is decent and honestly has a bit of body to it. Despite the lightness in other categories this is a bit surprising, however it is VERY strongly carbonated almost to a ridiculous degree, which honestly combined with other aspects of the feel lend to fast drinking and surprising refreshing vibe to it despite the lower quality.

Overall this beer is what it is. Super easy to drink and not much else. Yeah it has some malt character but it's largely covered by flaws and the only redeeming feature of it is just how much of a lawnmower/frat beer this is."
Worst,Busch Beer,1.97,"Pretty shocked I've never reviewed this!

Look: Classic pale golden color, obvious carbonation with the thin, white foam cap.

Nose: Sweet corn and light malted grains, like wheat or hay. Maybe some green, grassy scented hop and tangy, metallic sharpness.

Feel & Flavor: Certainly crisp, very light and pretty jazzy. Cream 'i corn sweetness with very lightly malted field grains, more sweetness with a tangy edge and green, herbal, maybe even spice blend, like from Grandma's kitchen.

Overall: It's pretty much the classic American adjunct light lager through and through. Personally it's one and done for me."
Worst,Busch Beer,1.67,"I'm sure I must have had this back in high school and forgotten, but I'm recently revisiting any AAL I can find. Oh my is this abysmal. I just had an Old Milwaukee and it was a gem in comparison. Pours piss yellow with bubbles that fade to nothing. Aroma - I had to smell this multiple times to confirm with my sensitive sniffer - is wet cardboard. First time I've ever engaged the lowest end of the scale after near 1k beers. Flavors are much ""better"", in that it's remotely palatable, though I'm not certain what the heck is going on - just corn/grain? Dunnoh, but finishes fairly dry and clean thankfully, though with a bit of metallic. Yikes."
Worst,Busch Beer,3.03,"Picked up a tall can at the beer store (Ontario) for $2 which was on sale, normal price $2.25. It’s not the worst beer I’ve had but don’t see myself buying this again. There is better options at this price point."
Worst,Busch Beer,2.92,"This is the beer of my college days. I drank so much Busch over a 4 year period, out of a keg, I have very little memory of that time period. Went up to Circle K to fill truck up with gas, so I was of course then low on funds and didn’t want to spend over $10 for a 12 pack of something. I already know I am shooting low. Was gonna buy Budweiser till my eye spotted the limited edition Busch 12er for 9.99. Had to. Just for nostalgia. It’s pretty bad, tastes kind of like beer. Budweiser which also is a poor beer tastes a smidge better. But my only other option was an 18 pack of Rolling Rock for $15. Which I probably will but next time I fill up truck for gas. I have Busch a 3, but really it’s more like 2.5-2.75 overall. But a good memory of when very little mattered and I was just pounding plastic cups of keg Busch beer."
Worst,Busch Beer,4.92,"This is a beer that is beyond refreshing and is perhaps the most underrated beer for its price point. Yeah it may not look as good as a craft beer, but smell just reminds you of relaxation and bliss. It just feels so nice as it pours down your throat, cooling you down after a long hot day outside. The mild yet great taste of Busch is what people look for after a long day’s worth of hard work. There’s nothing like an ice cold Busch during a hot fishing trip at the river."
Worst,Busch Beer,3.03,"Its a cheap American corn beer, the f*ck do you want? Why come on this site to bitch when you know what it is? This isnt a craft, ipa, micro brewshit. It a beer you buy to drink after work or at the dock or vegged out while watching football. If you can find it in a tallboy you know what it is. Not great, not awful, some foam, only skunked if warm. I cant believe theres a light version of it based on how light this one is, i would never try that, but Michelob light exists so hell maybe theres some kinda trashy golf fan out there who it would be perfect for. Its middle line American beer, dont bitch, if you like budlight you wouldnt be able to tell the difference blindfolded. Throw me one, can or bottle if it exists, i wont complain."
Worst,Busch Beer,1.03,"Honestly, I made an account because of how wrong I think the current score is for this beer. There's no way busch isn't paying for reviews on this site or something. I've been known to drink shitty beer in the past but this one really puts the SHITTY in shitty beer. It's simultaneously too sweet and also lacking in flavor. It leaves an awful taste in your mouth. In my opinion, literally every other beer at the same price point is better."
Worst,Busch Beer,2.23,"12oz can - review from notes

This is a decent adjunct, I like how clean it drinks. You need to keep it ice cold, but that goes without saying for the style. Just okay, with very little off-flavors (a little skunk and rotting corn water, especially if it heats up)

its okay for p*ss-water"
Worst,Busch Beer,3.41,I don't understand what the fuss is about. This isn't the best beer but it isn't the worst either. Perfect for when you are on a budget or having a party.
Worst,Busch Beer,1.84,"Drinking this at a friend's house, free beer is good beer, right?
Well no, not necessarily.
Looks light golden yellow with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to zero and no visible lacing.
Smells like corn, I know there are people who like corn in beer, but I do not.
Taste follows the nose.
Mouth feel is light for the style.
Overall free beer is sometimes okay beer and that is okay.
Cheers!"
Worst,Busch Beer,3.82,"I'm a connoisseur and I have tasted some of the best rated beers along with the worst rated beers and living in Southwest Texas all my life I've learned that the majority of people in my area like crap commercial beer and think craft beer is terrible. An excellent beer to them is Natural Light which is if I'm not mistaken the lowest rated beer on BA. It's always hot here so after a blazing hot workday you won't discriminate an ice cold beer especially if it is offered to you. I had a Milwaukee's Best one time that was so good and so refreshing but only under extreme conditions. Beers like Budwieser, Busch, Lone Star, Coors, and Miller I prefer to drink with the addition of key lime juice and salt. I also prefer cans for this because you can break the tab off, use a lime to wipe all over the top and then salt it. It's the only way I can enjoy these types of beers but when money is tight I usually get Miller Highlife or Lone Star. I had to buy Busch today because I couldn't find a store carrying the ones I wanted. Now I will discuss the attributes without the addition of lime and salt.

Looks: If you hadn't poured it yourself you'd think it was a glass of ice cold piss.
Smell: Smells like ass with a hint of corn. Maybe peanut
Taste: Tastes like whoever brewed it had no concern to mask the alcohol which has a small amount of methanol along side the ethanol.
Feel: The mouth feel is not something that is worth rating. You wanna swallow as fast as you can. Do not swish.
Overall: Overall this beer is tolerable but far from gourmet. A commercial beer will always have low ratings."
Worst,Icehouse,2.7,"Poured from a 24oz can best by Nov 7th 2022

On the pour an impressive mostly fine woth some fizz 4 finger head forms then has enough retention to only lose a finger a minute. The head does become more fizzy and rocky however, amd carbonation is very high in the light golden body.

Aroma is pretty meh. Cheap lager tartness on a relatively decent corn and malt base but the cheap ick is there. Not the cleanest. Slight Metallic note.

Taste is actually nice for an ice beer. It's sortof like light Colt 45 or something but with a bit of that cheap ick. Malty corny and surprisingly light. There wants to be bitterness but it fades fast and I'm not sure if it's alcohol or hops.

Feel is light but mouthcoating. Quite drinkable and refreshing. This beer is one of the most chuggable Ice Beers I've had. Short finish on the ""main"" flavors but a light mouthcoating sweet corn adjunct sticks around for a while.

Overall I was expecting worse. For an ice beer its not bad, but still colt 45 is better if you want cheap above 5%, but MHL is still the king."
Worst,Icehouse,2.96,"Wow, this was surprisingly not only not bad, but pretty okay. Surprised by just how low the avg ratings are here. Revisited for the first time since poor college days decades ago and found a non-offensive, sweet corn malty beverage I'd have again."
Worst,Icehouse,2.58,"16 oz can from the discount bin at Albertsons. pale golden pour, frothy head, no retention. Aroma isn't really a factor, no aroma, but at least its not bad. Taste is light malts and adjunct grains, but not sweet. A small bitter bite at the finish. It's not horrible...."
Worst,Icehouse,2.77,"Someday when we're old men sitting in our floating rocking chairs on our space porches watching the starships roll by, we'll dream of the amazingly cheap ice beers we used to buy in our youth to get us drunk on a lazy day, because the only thing left to buy will be overpriced mars pale ales. But today is not that day.
Look man it's an ice beer. It's meant to be cheap, strong, and less filling. And they say this was the first. Same as everything else in this style: strong malt, slight sweet corn, light feeling, only a tad skunky if you drink slow and let it warm. You know what you bought this for, if you wanna be critical about it piss off back to the ipa factory you vape at next to the burned out train station. Among ice beers? I put it in second behind busche and just before bud because it's ever so slightly darker. It's fun to change it up, so if the race is at Daytona this week spring for a case"
Worst,Icehouse,2.21,"This beer sucks! This is competing too much with American Adjunct beers, and to make it worse it is almost an ice beer. If it is an ICE beer it does not surprise me, but I got a case of this back in the day and wound up dumping the rest out. I did not even want to give it to the riff-raff or to a friend in need. I rather buy them something else than ruing my reputation of being the beer aficionado of the clique. I would say this beer is good on a hot day where there is nothing else to drink and you are not trying to drink many of them and are barbecuing or it is a dog day of summer. This is a pour out beer. I would not disrespect my circulatory system with this garbage."
Worst,Icehouse,3.91,"(24 oz can, NOV0821; purchased cold single from Tony's at 32nd & Clark, Cleveland... decanted into my new 9 oz Genesee-branded taster glass)

L: polished-clear, pale, yellow liquid; unsurprising tight, white, lasting foam - yes!... lace spiraling down glass; constant collar

S: masa, play-doh, dry cereal grass, lipstick... intensity below-mellow, well under the threshold of off-putting obviosity

T: lightly-peppery (carbonic acid?) tortilla-tinged pils malt; extra dry, peppery aftertaste, with a delicate malt flavor lingering... about 1/4 through, and a subtle lemon or lime note has emerged in the aftertaste; mildly phenol perhaps as well

F: soft roll to its flow up front, almost inflating the palate, but quickly fade-dropping away, with a tailing carbonic prickle (not too much or too little - just enough)... perfect kiss of roundness up front, with an ideal drop and sparkle finishing it out

O: I finally found you! - and you're not half bad!... despite it having my beloved Miller-masa spicing, this is more or less typical of its packaging/branding, though its slightly drier cut and more pronounced peppery edge does make it stand out a bit... I'd probably buy this on occasion when craving nothing more than an 'ice-brewed' swill"
Worst,Icehouse,2.69,"Look: Straw
Smell: Malt and corn dust. Almost minty?
Taste: Wrong. Just all wrong. Like so bad it deserves a metal...but somehow is still enjoying. There's a suprising amount of barley malt character. Otherwise not much going on.
Feel: Like a lightly carbonated water.
Overall: This beer gets a really bad rap but I actually kind of like it. It's one of my favorite macro lagers. It's so bad it's good. Easy to drink and tastes good...ish."
Worst,Icehouse,3.25,"From a 24oz silo:

Appearance: Clear gold, good head.

Smell: Light corn, damp hay?

Taste: Mild sweetness, corn throughout, medium body. No obvious flaws.

Overall: Icehouse was the first beer I had my roommate buy for me at college 26 years ago. For some reason, I did not review it back then, or even have it again in the ensuing time. But I've been on a cheap lager kick lately so I picked up a single silo. It was not bad at all! I was expecting some fusels or other flaws, but really had nothing to complain about. Might even pick it up again sometime."
Worst,Icehouse,1.76,"Exceptionally smooth as an ice beer usually performs. A little sweat and really heavy. It’s meant to get you drunk and yeah, it does that effectively but it’s not pleasant. After the entire stove pipe you will certainly be feeling yourself but man it’s just not a pleasant taste. Classic miller product. It cost a buck thirty so I’m not that upset, but still not something I’m clamoring to get again."
Worst,Icehouse,2.33,"Look: It pours golden and clear. It has a white, fizzy head. Head retention is low.

Smell: It has a sweet grain and corn aroma. There is a hint of spice well into the background.

Taste: It has grainy sweet flavors with corn mixed in. There are some spice elements that are low.

Feel: It has a carbonic bite to it as well. It has a medium light body with a carbonic and sweet grain after taste.

Overall, the aroma is actually decent and the taste is okay, but the carbonic and sweet grainy after taste is just not very good."
Worst,Icehouse,2.29,"It a pale-golden beer that is very transparent and has a bubbly heady that disappears quickly. It is inoffensive on the nose but lacks anything to enticing. Just some corn flavors. The taste is similar. It is sweet and adjuncty but not bad. The feel is loose but with a nice foaminess at the end. Overall, not a bad beer but not a good beer."
Worst,Icehouse,3.76,"Picked up a 12 pack for $5

My expectations were really really low due to the price point, I mean it’s a $0.42 beer, I usually buy yuengling as my cheap beer and it’s $0.83 a can.

This will now my go to home beer, it tastes like beer, smells like beer, it even tastes good when it’s ice cold, and I can get a 12 pack for the price of a pint.

Update

I’m on my 10th 12 pack now. It’s nice to throw in in heavy rotation with craft beers. I’d say A good ratio is like 36 icehouse to 1 6 pack of craft beer.

I mean seriously you get 4 beers for the price of a 20 oz coke, what more could you want.

I’m ready to call it the official beer of the coronavirus."
Worst,Icehouse,3.55,A decent lower quality lager with a higher ABV than traditional lagers. Retail price between .99 and $1.49. A more traditional lager taste because of lower sucrose content compared to high gravity. A decent budget beer.
Worst,Icehouse,2.59,"16oz can stamped MAR0220 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 5.5% ABV. The beer pours brilliantly bright golden straw yellow in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is grainy with a bit of sulfur. The taste is sour grain with a corny cereal finish. Mild bitterness with a decent hit of diacetyl. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, not good. There's a lot of flaws here even for an AAL ice beer."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,1.85,"Purchased as a single tall can from Exxon for $2.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear goldenrod, with a minimal pale white head.
S - Slight ethanol on the nose. Corn flakes. Refined wheat.
T - Same as the aroma, but with a little bit of a metallic note (I'll blame it on the can). A little bit like dryer lint, as well.
F - Light-bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Really easy-to-drink, if you ignore the taste.
O - It's pretty bad, but one of the better macro malt liquors out there. Not as good as OE800, but better than Mickey's. I've had this before, but this is the only time I've gotten to actually give it a review. If you're pre-gaming before a big trip to a Goodwill to look for parts to build a space shuttle, this is the brew for you!"
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.12,"L: A very nice clear, hold with a hint of amber and a full white head that quickly dissolves into a thin ring and islands
S: corn, malts, no hops or off aromas
T: okay. a mild corn sweetness with some apple or pear, a bit of buttered biscuit, and the slightest hint of hops.
F: mildly carbonated, slightly sweet at the front of the swallow, fairly smooth going down, and leaving a very slight pepper on your tongue and a slightly bitter sweet aftertaste
O: this is the driest and lightest tasting on the malt liquors I've tried. You can tell it shares the AB bloodline, in a blind test Hurricane could easily be mistaken for one of the Budweiser or Busch beers. If you like Bud, you'll probably like Hurricane."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.38,"The head fizzled away fairly quickly, but there are still a large amount of bubbles forming an rising to the top to quickly have their gas escape into the world.

The nose is a mix of malt and weak brown sugar sweetness and metallic medicinal notes that are filling in for hop bitterness in an unsuccessful attempt. It's actually somewhat off-putting.

Luckily, the taste avoids the aroma's pitfall. It's actually not that bad. It has a little bit of toast mixed in with the sweetness that it brings. And it's not overly sweet by any means. There's a generic bitterness that I might argue is slightly woody (maybe it had some contact with some beechwood chips). There's a slight unripe banana note in the aftertaste.

The nose hurts this a lot, and warmth isn't its friend. But there were some parts that weren't so bad. Drinking fairly cold was better."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2,"Another downer, I had its high gravity counterpart, and while it was below average, it was much closer to average than poor. This one is right at the 2 level that separates poor from terrible. Pours mostly clear yellow. Aroma is sweet and grainy, but something is off. Taste is sweet in an unpleasant way, not overly sweet, just not a good sweet."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,2.19,"This is by no means a great beer, but it is my preferred (lol) malt liquor! 25 oz can, ice cold, goes down smooth and easy. 2 cans for $3 at the local Weis... SOLD!

Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.51,"(40 oz, clear bottle, 'Category 5', 6% alc./vol., 18292 code... purchased cold, decanted into tulip)

L: crystal-clear, brassy-colored liquid, topped with loose, bouncy, off-white suds, which collapse in 2 min... actually several boogers of lace, gets chunkier with longer rings with each pour, also keeps a collar

S: dried grass, dried flowers, musty burlap/cardboard, soft hint of skunk; underlying hang of cereal-like graininess (Kix-forward), faint metallic overtone, dull presence of alcohol

T: dominant note front and center of a mildly-sweet hard candy with a dull citrus and/or butterscotch flavor - haven't tasted quite this shade of malt syrup-osity in any other malt liquor... kind of a champagne soda aftertaste, with a very delicate spicy phenol lingering, as well as a faint nutty husk note

F: with first pour, very little carbonation to excite the palate; even with subsequent pours kicking up a tall head, it doesn't translate to anything remotely prickly on the tongue... the body starts with a mild oily grip, but immediately thins out, leaving no impression of dimension... rather delicate warmth stirs after each sip

O: skunk not as bad as others... goes down pretty easy, and it grew on me, but I'd recommend drinking it colder to avoid the odd hard candy element - it's not that bizarre of a flavor for something like this, seemed to trail off, but lacks a secondary flavor to 'balance' it... at any rate, surprised at its relative quality - didn't intend to, but drank almost the whole bottle"
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.47,"Decent malt liquor. Picked up a six of pint cans while out of town. Aroma is sweet fruit and corn. Flavor tracks, with green apple and grape making an appearance, with a grassy finish. Cheap, easy drinking."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.37,My daily driver! Preferred beer in my book. I drink about 3 25oz cans a day. Don't know why i prefer over other beers. I dont get drunk on this beer. I don't know why my tollarence is so high.
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.73,"Perfect if you want to get hammered (make sure to get the 40oz) Love the taste but it varies on bottle to bottle. Sometimes I’ll get one and it smells and tastes like cough syrup, probably due to too much bleach during the sterilization process. Other than that, in Idaho, the ABV is 8.1% but I’ve seen others like NY, LA, NC, and CA that are locked in at 5.9% - 6%. Great malt though. Definitely recommend you to try it if you’re wanting to get drunk."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,4.7,"Appearance- Nice Golden with a Very Thick White Head.
Aroma -Sweet, Malty, Corny, Ricey, Lots of White Breadiness, Low Hoppiness..not much.
Taste- Very Sweet, Malty, Corny, Ricey, White Breadiness, and Decent Hop Bite.
Mouthfeel-Light-Medium with a Light-Medium Body.
Overall- Its a great Malt Liquor to try from AB-InBev. A nice well rounded Beer Flavored Malt Liquor with a slight Fruity Note. Better than King Cobra in my opinion. Would recommend."
Worst,Hurricane Malt Liquor,3.05,"(As ""Hurricane"" with ""Category 5"" on the label but the ABV listed at the top of the label as being 6% ABV - not 8.1% or 5.8% or 5.9% ABV as I've seen on other Hurricane branded beers).

""Malt liquor."" 6% ABV. 138 kCal per 12oz / 577.39 kJ per 12 oz. 0.00 fat per 12 oz. 4.20 carbohydrates per 12 oz. .90 protein per 12 oz.

Ingredients: Water; Corn, Rice and/or Dextrose Syrup; Barley Malt; Hop Extract; Yeast.

Glass bottle in the classic 40oz format purchased at a 7-11 in Manhattan for $3.31 including tax and deposit. Clear glass. Branded black screw-off cap.

Pours a clear pale copper body - obviously filtered - below an off-white cap of mediocre consistency and above average retention (~5-7 minutes).

Aroma hints at graininess in addition to decently disguised corn adjunct, cheap 6-row barley, and pale malt. Inoffensive. Doesn't suggest a syrupy or watery beer, but I'm reading it as on the thicker side based on this aroma. Hop profile isn't completely absent; I think I get some mild grassiness. Suggests an innocuous malt liquor with no egregious flaws but plenty of shortcomings in terms of complexity, depth of flavour, subtlety, balance, and build. Aromatic intensity is below average. Doesn't seem boozy and I detect no off-notes.

Taste is indeed innocuous and inoffensive, which is high praise for a malt liquor. Sure, there's a bit too much 6 row and pale malt sweetness as well as corn adjunct, and it's a bit too thick, but it isn't syrupy or watery and it isn't cloyingly sweet or overly adjunct-emphatic. I've certainly had worse, and there's a slight scintilla of grassy hop flavour to its credit.

Certainly not dialed-in, but it's not imbalanced. Shallow and simple, but approachable and pleasant enough for a 6% ABV malt liquor offered in the 40 oz format. Let's be fair - there's far worse out there. This may be a bit insipid, but that isn't always a bad thing in the budget beer category.

Texture is slightly overcarbonated and crisp. Unrefreshing owing to its slightly syrupy feel and overly thick presence on the palate. Has too much weight on the palate for a beer as insipid as this. Not oily, gushed, tannic, astringent, rough, hot, boozy, or scratchy. This mouthfeel doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours, but it also doesn't clash with the taste.

Overall, it's mediocre at best, but it's one of the better (least bad?) attempts at the style I've tried recently. $2.99 USD plus tax and deposit is as fair a price as you'll find in Manhattan for such an inoffensive brew, and this is probably up there with Ballantine XXX in terms of my go-to budget 40oz format brews. Many will shit on this because it happens to be brewed by Anheuser-Busch, but in a blind taste test I'm confident it'd outperform most competing brands. Judging it strictly to style, it's actually pretty decent fare and I won't mind taking down the entire 40oz bottle.

Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.99,"Poured into a 12oz glass from an undated 25oz can.

On the pour a decent 1.5 finger white head formed. The head has decent retention but it's a pretty fast dissipation to a thinner cap. The body is a solid gold with lots of fine carbonation.

Aroma us a bit rough. Some off apple juice and a bit of a funky lager. A bit malty other than that but meh.

Taste has a bit of off flavor. There is a nice malty sweetness right off the bat and it's quite attenuated and stays pretty balance. There is a twinge of tartness, but for the style this is decent. Biscuity finish with a hint of corn.

Feel is drinkable and relatively crisp, but it's not the most chuggable beer with some odd esters here and there. Medium finish with a pretty neutral mouthfeel.


Overall for the style this is pretty good. I still prefer colt 45, or Mickeys, but this is a lot better than OE or Hurricane. Not bad for a cheaper buzz."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.77,"The first time I ran across this beer was 30 years ago in Jacksonville, FL. I was in Florida for the Daytona 500 and swung by the Anheuser Busch brewery in Jacksonville on the way to Daytona. At that time, my ""beer palate"" wasn't all that developed, and the extra malt flavor of this beer was appreciated, since I was drinking pilsners at the time.
30 years later, I stumbled across the 25 oz cans in a local gas station (I never said it was highbrow) and decided to give one a shot. Upon arriving home, I cracked the can open and poured (most of) the beer into a 16 oz glass.
The color is light (for a malt) and the head is respectable due to the fairly high carbonation. The first sip brought back memories of the caramel-malt flavor I remembered from years ago. It was refreshing and was a good match for the 102-degree heat.
This is NOT a complex beer, nor is it something that one would go to the ends of the earth for. However, it is a good cold beer for a hot afternoon and has fallen back on my Lawnmower Beer list!"

Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,1.47,"Tastes like a slightly stronger Budweiser. Considering it's made by Anheuser-Busch, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case. Frankly, I'm not too thrilled with this drink."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,1.84,"King Cobra is a very bland malt liquor that I recommend to no one. I liken it to the beer equivalent of Vodka, mostly flavorless. If you want a cheap beer, Icehouse Edge, Steel Reserve 211, Honey Brown are more flavorful choices."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,1.98,"The beer is very pale and sickly yellow with little to no head when poured out into a glass (but then again who drinks this out of a glass?). The smell is mostly of fusel alcohol and some corn and possibly malt. Not much hops. Not very appealing. The taste is better than the smell. It is balanced and the sweetness is balanced out by the whatever hops are in here acceptably. That being said, there isn't a whole lot of complexity or depth of flavor or anything like that. The mouthfeel is loose but foamy. Overall, not great but being a malt liquor, that makes sense. Its a simple malt liquor that gets the job done."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.29,"25oz can stamped 18337 (about 6 months old) poured into a vintage Spuds MacKenzie mug at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright golden yellow with fizzy nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and few bubbles. The aroma is chemical more than anything else, maybe a hint of corn. The taste is nuetral until mid palate where rotten corn and spoiled vegetable starts to come on before a buttery, oily unbittered finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, highly carbonated and undry in the finish. There is a pretty slick unfinished fermentation finish and some spoiled / tart notes that linger. Overall, bad. At least pick a higher ABV malt liquor if it's going to be unpleasant. The only taste or feel that come through are the flaws."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2,"It's not the worst brew out there, but it's far closer to the bottom than the top. Had it last about 5 years ago, don't know why I bought it but I did.
It is a malt liquor, and as such it is not terrible example. As I should be judging it for what it is, the rating probably should be higher. But I did end up tossing out a little less than half of the 40oz bottle. It was just not good."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.39,"40 oz. bottle:

Pours clean, straw yellow. A fizzy white head descends to a thin island. No real lacing. Typical macro lager/malt liquor look.

The smell is pretty clean - some fruity alcohol. Cheap lager aroma. Not much worse than expected.

The taste is sweet without much flavor (some cooked veggies?) Pretty devoid of flavor except some alcohol and maybe a hint of grain. Relatively clean finish. Bland, cardboard like aftertaste, that is, thankfully, relatively short-lived.

Pretty smooth considering alcohol shows. But, thin - thinner than others of the style.

A watery, alcohol-forward (despite it being a modest 6% abv), bland, but relatively drinkable, cheap malt liquor. Sweet-leaning. There are better (and worse) malt liquors out there."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,2.29,So This is a buck or 2 by me. The smell well it smells burnt and like a gorillas ass but its my preferred 40 oz malt when theyre out of colt 45 at my gas station but this stuff will rip you apart fast after 3 40's I'm busted and in the back of a cop car you get what I'm saying lol. Not bad if you want to get ripped up real fast.
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.18,"Appearance:
Sudsy white head that falls to thin film. Beautiful clear gold color and lots of bubbles rising.

Aroma:
Faint pils malt, rice, slight fruit juice note. No Hops.

Flavor:
Clean, grainy, ricey, slight bit of alcohol sweetness. No distinct hop presence in the mouth. No strong off flavors.

Mouthfeel:
Light and slightly rough on the tongue after a while but within tolerance for style. CO2 is high.

Overall:
This is a cheap malt liquor that drinks easy and has little in the way of flavor, good or bad. In the style category it is one of the better ones. In the grand scheme of beer, it is a bottom feeder for sure."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,4.24,"Appearance- Gold, Thick White Head, Barely Bubbly.
Aroma- Faint and Subtle, Some Malts, Corny, Ricey, White Breadiness, and Almost no Hoppiness.
Taste- Sweet, Malty, Corny, Ricey, Bready, and Very Very Low Hoppiness.
Mouthfeel- Light and Watery with a Light and Watery Body.
Overall Conclusion- Not one I'd go out a get. Its not what I'm looking for in a Malt Liquor. The body and flavor are kinda lacking. Somewhat unbalanced in the flavor category as well. However, its a great entry-level Malt Liquor. For those who are wanting to step their game to a Malt Liquor. Would recommend for that."
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,3.42,"(40 oz bottle, no bottle code or date... poured into a snifter, about 1/4 of the bottle at a time)

L: crystal-clear, slightly-pale gold colored liquid; little foam on the pour, only a thin collar remains... second pour yielded much more foam, but it deflates in seconds, though a few lil scars of lace circle the glass

S: no spray of skunk upon cap removal... light pilsner malt aroma with hint of cardboard... dried grass undertone, little alcohol present... certainly malty, but anemic intensity

T: one of the thinnest malt flavors/foundations I've come across in a malt liquor - little discernible sweetness, bitterness is relatively dull but has a mild peppery bite with could be in part carbonic acid, aftertaste is quite dry with perhaps minuscule notes of circus peanut and dried out candy caramel, but that's a stretch... the malt opens up a tad through subsequent sips, but the overall taste remains that of a 'premium'-grade Bud, underbelly as watery as some watery water

F: little body (take away the water and it's just air), little dimension, virtually no finish (if that's possible)... there's a light, refreshing kiss of soft carbonation with each sip... the engineering on this remarkable (or it's just water diluted with beer) - probably the second most watery beer I've ever had next to Natty Ice (oh wow! AB brews that too, surprise surprise)

O: impulse buy at a liquor store I'd never visited (along with a low-priced Johnnie Walker Green); pulled the bottle out from behind a couple others in a dimly-lit fridge, thinking the less exposure to light might bode better for any skunk present... one of the most neutral-tasting, boring-to-death, yet supremely-crushable malt liquors I've come across, which is its only compliment as it's not the least bit off-putting given that there's next to nothing going on... I would no doubt buy this again in the event I needed a dirt-cheap beer buzz in large volume"
Worst,King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,4.98,"Dirt cheap beer with good taste and nice buzz if you're looking for one. The apperience is a classic pale straw with slight gold hues. I like the presentation of the beer. A simple design with the cobra. The aroma is sweet and inviting, soft yeasty and general smell of beer. The first sip is damn near perfect. Top end of sweetness and maltiness. The middle is tangy with a good amount of malt and finishes with a clean, crisp and dry swallow. The hop notes are grassy like all lagers however you don't pick up much. It's really all about balance. This beer is not sickening sweet and the adjucts are not noticeable. The feel is rather syrupy and not creamy. There is a decent amount of body. Nice crisp, clean and smooth. I really think this is a great cheap beer, don't hesitate to give it a try!"
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.34,"Pours the color of lemon-line Gatorade, cloudy, briefest of quarter-inch heads that disappears, a bit of carbonation breaking the surface, no lacing. Smells like margarita mix with a whiff of alcohol burn at the back. Taste is thick sugary drink mix and cheap grain alcohol, like something you'd mix together with your friends in high school. Mouthfeel is thick (sweet), but the carbonation is nice."
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.11,"Smells like a margarita, but doesn't quite have the taste of one, as the lime is somewhat front and center, but battling with other tastes for top spot. Feels slick on the tongue. The booze is mostly hidden here, but you'll get to taste it soon enough. I wouldn't have this again."
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.49,"Color on the pour seems to be a hazy yellow with no head at all.
Smell is malty lime. Does that make sense? Like lots of lime with some really sweet white bread smells. Not bad but a bit odd.
Taste is kind of a medicinal malty lime. Again a bit odd, right?
Mouth feel is sticky tangy sour and sweet. A lot going on here, right. Lots of bubbles still popping in the back of the mouth and throat after the taste. Kind of fun. Like Pop Rocks.
Overall this is an over priced product. I love that this is a Bud light product! I do not like a lot of the Bud line up starting with the signature Bud let alone the crap Bud Light. Yet this seems to laugh in the face of the Bud Light. Artificial flavor, huge ABV and nowhere light in the mouth feel. I really have to rate this well for kind of kicking a lot of Bud norms to the curb. And I do apologize to regular Bud drinkers. Carry on and Cheers! Drink what makes you happy! Do not let some one else tell you what to drink!"
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.18,"(25 oz can, 19089; 'contains alcohol'; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)

L: cloudy, jade(?)-yellow liquid; foam on pour, quickly collapses to nothing, persistent activity of bubbles rising

S: smells shooting out as soon as the tab was popped... smells exactly like a blend of margarita mix and 'malt beverage' - enticing, but hardly representative of my beloved malt liquor species

T: margarita mix: sweet, but not sickly so... the background/base is certainly malty, no doubt (and no doubt artificially enhanced with the added sugars), but its definition is obscured... rather flavorful; faint vinyl pool liner note in the back though... is that bitterness or booze struggling to break out?... a bit cloying, eh?

F: it's not all-out syrupy, but there's definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8%, the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence, but nonetheless a tad too weighty

O: I'd been avoiding it, but it was inevitable; a gap-filling review if there ever was one... alcopop all the way; interesting, but not all that bad for what it is (I'll never rid of my sweet tooth or my love of both 'malt beverage' and lime)... I may have said it before, but if slop like this is a 'malt liquor' (and the reasons this is on BA are probably understandable, if debatable), then y'all gotta add my old-school jawn, Smirnoff Ice in somewhere - 'fruit and field beer'??, wink wink (1467)"
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,4.73,"Lime-A-Rita has a fizzing-away head, a hazy, yellow-gray appearance, and some bubbles. The aroma is of pale malt and spicy fruit or margarita mix. Flavor is similar. This is very sweet, and Lime-A-Rita finishes medium sweet.

Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.28,"Received this as part of a pick your own six for Father's day. I really don't know what this is supposed to be. Not beer not liquor and not good. I see its classified as malt liquor, guess that's as close as anything. The closest thing I could compare the taste to would be a hard lemonade. And I don't like those"
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.32,"24oz can with 18269 stamped on bottom of can poured into Duvel tulip. Presumably that's some sort of date but hard to tell what kind. 18 is probably this year. And it could be 26 day of Sept, or the 269th day of the year which is... holy shoot... Sept 26 as well. Wow. I guess we've narrowed it down by sheer luck. Anyway picked this up at the grocery store. Can is slightly dented so who knows if it'll taste metallic like that usually seems to be the case with dented beer cans. ""beer'.

Appearance - Opaque white-yellow body. Something like coconut milk with pineapple juice. Very, very little white head that dissipates almost instantly. Basically expected behavior for any drink that contains any amount of salt, which I presume this does. 3.5

Smell - Strong lime and perfume. A weird scent that is presumably actual tequila. Bleh. 1.5

Taste - Sweet. Lime. A touch of alcohol. Actually not as bad as I was bracing myself for. Not offensive just not tasty. Tastes like a spiked limeade. 2.5

Mouthfeel - Syrupy up front. A bit dry in the finish. Medium to heavy bodied. A bit effervescent. 2.5

Overall - Definitely can't bring myself to glup this one. It's more of a sipper. But probably a good pick for people who don't actually like beer because this is nothing like one. Never again for me personally. 2.5"
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.85,"This stuff is hard to drink. Let's face it, you aren't here to sip a drink and enjoy it, you're here to catch a buzz. That's why you bought an 8% can of malt liquor that tastes like limes. Luckily after the first one it gets a lot easier, but if you have any kind of blood sugar issues just opt for a vodka soda or something."
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,1.5,"8oz canned 2/15/18 poured into a margarita glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours slightly hazy and looks just like lime juice. No head, no lacing. The aroma is artificial lime and cough drops with a small sidecar of booze. The flavor is the same oddly artificial lime with some tartness and no trace of barley. Mouthfeel is very thin bodied, lightly carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, this is not beer. Not in any way, fashion or otherworldly dimension could this be considered beer. I am only reviewing in my quest to get all the bottom 100 list."
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,2.43,"Bought a 25oz can from Marukai $2.69
Hazy, light golden color
Light mouthfeel
High carbonation
Sweet lime taste, basically what you expect from a margarita
Overall it is what it says it is. I don't see how it could be called a beer and what Bud Light has to do with it, but if you drink it over crushed ice then it's like a margarita in a can. Without the ice to dilute it it's too sweet. If you feel like having a margarita then this is for you and that is what my rating is based on, over crushed ice. If you want a beer then this is not for you."
Worst,Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,3.06,"Poured from the tiny can, into a Budweiser pilsner glass. Here we go!

Pale dull muted dark straw colored body. Almost a sort of dark straw, and opaque. Fast amouts of cola fine carbonation through the body, bubbling up on the top like soda. Head creation is non existent, off white, soda popping and instant dissolve right out of the can and crackling noise. Not quite margarita looking, or daiquiri, and dull.

Aroma is not too bad for description. Decent lime like cordial aroma and lots of it. Slight very faint herbal and zest tone, but really does flirt with a big soapy character. There's even a touch of basic rock salt to this as well. Decent and basic, but real lime quality this is not.

Palate is quite sweet. Tastes like a basic machine made slushy type quality margarita. Large boozy character in the aftertaste, and strangely a big alcohol kick that just comes really out of nowhere. This is going straight to my head. Sticky simple syrup, and faint basic lime, with quite a bit of alcohol sweetness towards the end.

This comes off as a pour mans daiquiri, but also unfortunately has too much of a noticeable alcohol kick, that it would be hard to get through more than a few of these casually which is what it should be made for. Good concept, but not liking the execution."
Worst,Olde English 800,2.85,"Dark gold, amber looking color. Had 1 finger of white head on the pour and quickly lost half that. Looks like the half left is slowly dropping as I type. Lazy streaming carbonation visible.

Nose is a touch sweet. Grain smell on the nose comes through. Like corn grain.

The mouth is sweet and a bit of a malt like flavor. Seems simple on the taste, lets put the two together, now we have sweet malts. Is it overly sweet? No.

Mouth feel starts as a bit medium and finishes surprisingly well. A touch of lingering sweet malt and yes there is the grain on the back of the mouth that sits there for a minute.

I am in las Vegas, NV and was able to get the 7.5% ABV version and I did chill the crap out of the 24 oz. can before I cracked it. I think if this higher ABV (higher than the 5.9% ABV version) were to get warmed up it may have that malt liquor taste I find unpleasant. Kind of that, ""I am trying to be a lager, why the shit did they add this fructose syrup to spoil me?"", type of thing. If this were to warm up and had a sweeter taste were to come out I would say no way. I will say I have had much worse malt liquor beers for sure. Still searching for my final opinion. The one thing I do not like is I find myself trying to drink it before it warms. And today is a warm day, even though I am inside.. O.K. Maybe that is what this is for, fast slam hopefully quick buzz on a cheap beer, kind of a Four Loko ""beer"" thing. Enough rambling. How about will I buy it again? The higher ABV warming does come through a bit towards the end as I try to chase a chilled product. Buy it again is still a questionable thought. I really do not think I would try this again unless I could get the lower ABV. More along the lines of an Icehouse beer. Yet there may be a fit for this with some heavy meats on a good BBQ day. Damn now I am just hungry? This has been an exhausting push and pull beer review. I really look forward to more people trying the higher gravity and seeing what they think. I think at 5.9% and being cheap, again around the Icehouse region, this might work. I know people look for the ""higher gravity"" one, yet now I seek the ""lower gravity"" one"". So sorry for the ramble ladies and gents, Cheers!"
Worst,Olde English 800,4,"Malt liquor, or adjunct lager, is a mass produced cheap quality beer. Everyone who has consumed ""gas station beer"" is aware. OE800 is the king of malt liquor as they claim. I relocated to a large metropolitan area from a small rural community, so I never even saw OE800. I lived here for almost 6 months before I actually bought a tall boy. I was pleasantly surprised. Literally the best malt liquor I have ever consumed. Very similar to Bud, and Bud is not that good when compared to craft lager. A sale price with sales tax included of $1.39 is a decent value."
Worst,Olde English 800,1.57,"First time ever that I've tried this beer, even though it's been around for so long. Way back when, way before the beer craze began, this was the big ""go to"" beer for certain groups of people and it was probably because of the ABV. Anyway, I digress. Finally tried this and I was really sorry I did. Blehh. Terrible beer."

this just tastes like variations of miller beer. little hoppier than colt 45, 5.9% version. good beer, too strong to have with food and best had as an intitial beer or a final beer of the day."

S - Malts and sweet corn are the primary notes present.

T - Very malty with an almost honey-like finish. Sweet but inoffensive.

F - Medium carbonation, mouthfeel is somewhat chewy. Cleaner than some of the other MLs I've ticked.

O - The first time I tried reviewing this beer, I knocked the glass over by mistake and it spilled into my old desktop.
It's decent for what it is, but not worth the cost of the computer repair. (Rated to style, YMMV. Drink responsibly.)"

Taste: Slight bitterness, a little watery to start, then flavor comes on the finish, some metallic taste,
Feel: Reminds me of an adjunct lager, light chewiness and with prominent carbonation
Overall: A middle of the road malt liquor, it hits all the requirements but nothing stands out either good or bad.
Pair with seafood and spicy foods, also works with red meat or by itself really cold."
Worst,Olde English 800,2.2,I was initially drawn in by the value...it's cheap and a good bang for your buck. A classic malt liquor that so many people were buying in the ghetto. It wasn't amazing so I couldn't finish the whole thing and saved it for later. Once it got a little warmer- undrinkable. This is what I would consider a last resort beer. The value is okay but you can find better out there for a similar price.

Worst,Olde English 800,2.98,"It's not bad, I poured the first serving from a 42oz plastic bottle into a 16oz glass. I put the cap on the bottle and stuffed it back into the fridge. As I write this, I'm on the second pour. The pour produces a nice head that quickly dissipates to a ring of foam on the top of the glass. The color is a nice golden color and the smell is of sweet corn. I detect no off flavors or alcohol burn which surprises me given the malt liquor designation, but at 5.9% ABV there really shouldn't be any. As I drink the sweetness while not cloying, seems to stack up to the point where I wouldn't open another bottle. Overall I would give this beer a not bad/kind of good rating. Definitely way better than I expected."
Worst,Olde English 800,3.32,"L: clear yellow gold with a moderate, short lived head that dissolves into islands
S: some corn and a hint of hops with an odd chemical undertone
T: not all that bad, a little corn, some bready malt, even a touch of hoppy bitterness, but that odd chemicalbase is still there
F: moderately carbonated, pleasantly sweet at the top, but dry with a peppery aftertaste at the end. Not nearly as sweet and slick as other malt liquors
O: not half bad. There is a slight skunkiness that might be due to the 8 month old clear bottle, but it is a distraction and isn't overwhelming. Much less sweet and corn forward than other malt liquors and lacks the sweet, slimy aftertaste many had. It would definitely be on my shopping list if I was on a really tight budget"
Worst,Olde English 800,3.41,"Pours a beautifully clear dark gold color with a fat finger of near white head that has solid retention and leaves solid lacing. Right away, I can tell the low marks for appearance in other BAs’ reviews reveal incredible biase.

The aroma is initially much crisper and more hop forward that I imagined. There’s some corn and even a little skunkiness beneath, but I’d probably peg this as a Euro Lager if tasting it blind. As it sits, the corn aroma becomes much thicker smelling, to the beer’s detriment, but marks for first impressions.

The taste is definitely not as impressive, but still nothing awful. There’s a bit of that Euro Lager-type bitterness, crispness and light skunk, but also an underlying nuttiness that I don’t particularly favor. Some moderate sweetness lingers in the aftertaste (including a decent kiss of apple juice); it’s bot overpowering at first, but grows over time.

The carbonation level in the mouthfeel is super dialed in — very zippy, but without being too heavy handed.

We’ll see how I feel after another 30 or 40 ounces, but a pint in, this is a reasonable enough beverage — and, given that a four-pack costs less than a single of most “craft” lagers available in 16-ounce cans, seems like an even better value. The lingering apple sweetness is probably my least favorite part."
Worst,Olde English 800,3.29,"From a 24oz silo:

Appearance: Clear gold, huge head.

Smell: Corn, slight chemical note, plus wet rocks.

Taste: Very corny, sweetness all the way, medium feel.

Overall: Finally got around to reviewing this classic malt liquor. It was better than I expected, definitely a step or two above the Steel Reserves and Evil Eyes of the malt liquor world. Nice sweetness without being too sweet, no off or chemical notes in the taste though the nose had a bit of a weird note to it. Not bad!"
Worst,Olde English 800,4.55,Been drinking this for years & in NY its labeled at 5.9%. Got a few deuces while visiting Nevada and couldn't figure out why I was wasted after 3? Turns out its 7.5% out there (in cans). Wondered why it tasted a bit more potent! No complaints.
Worst,Olde English 800,2.04,"The label warned that this beer contained corn syrup. That might be the only thing that kept this from tasting like water. There was some carbonation. It might even be refreshing when consumed from a paper bag on a hot day. Still, all I tasted was corn syrup."
Worst,Olde English 800,2.38,"Purchased as a 7.5% 40 plastic bottle for $1.98 at a drive-thru. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear dark gold with a one-finger pale white head that goes away roughly three seconds after the pour.
S - Assorted grain and wet hay. Corn syrup. Slight ethanol.
T - Sweet malts hit you like a bus on this one! A one-dimensional corn vibe throughout. Sugary finish with an obvious alcohol warmth. Surprisingly well-balanced towards the end of the bottle.
F - Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Gives you an all-over warmth by the end of the bottle. Dangerously smooth.
O - Like other 40s I'm reviewing this week, I've had OE before but haven't really sat down to review it formally and objectively. This brew was with me on some awesome moments of my life. It was there when I lost my virginity. It was there when I saw my first parking lot fight. It was there when 4loko wasn't! With this aside, this isn't a great beer, but it's arguably the best 40. Sweet but relatively well-balanced and with a pretty good ""warm"" feeling at the end, this is a great brew for under $2.00 that is guaranteed to give you some kind of a buzz without tasting like gasoline. The flavor itself can be compared to a day-old open can of Yuengling - pretty terrible, but not bad at all (if that makes sense). Highly recommend."

Worst,Olde English 800,2.37,"Pours a crystal clear bright golden color. Quite effervescent with a thin velvety head that displays excellent head retention. Its actually quite a nice looking beer.

Aroma, well frankly, reminds me of someones breath after they've been drinking beer for a while ... has some notes of sweet grains, light fruity not notes and a stale alcohol note.

Taste has notes of sweat pastry and grains. Although there are some flavors here, its remarkably bland and muted overall. Its got a generic sweetness to it with a dry mildly bitter finish.

The feel is smooth and easy drinking.The carbonation is moderate but bright. There is something about this that coats your mouth and throat - not sure what it is, but I feel it as Im drinking through the can.

Overall this was not something Ill ever pick up again, but hey, at least I can say I tried it ..."

Worst,Molson Canadian 67,2.59,"Ok, we get it. It’s not Heady Topper. It’s not an illustrious IPA, not is it even regular Molson Canadian. We get it. That being said, our neighbors to the north crafted a very good, low-calorie option for when you want to crank brews and not worry about your waistline. Molson 67 still holds that classic Canadian lager tast, with a third of the calories. While that is something we at the 1009 are hardly worried about when grading this category it's hard to avoid. Unfortunately, this is a dying breed. Molson phased out 67 almost a year ago for “Molson Ultra”. So, we grabbed this while we could. So long 67, you had a good run."

Taste - a faint flavour of beer, but mostly like beer flavoured tonic water or club soda. Nothing horribly offensive.

Mouthfeel - feels way over carbonated body is super light, but these two factors don't go too well together.

Feel - extremely light watery body with prickly carbonation...

Overall - Might as well just drink a Molson Caanadian original... from what a remember the taste was tenfold better."
Worst,Molson Canadian 67,1.75,This tasted like a mix of water and the lightest beer available. I understand the need to watch your calorie intake but just drink water instead please. No flavor reminiscent of a beer.
Worst,Molson Canadian 67,1.78,"Molson Canadian Sixty Seven.
The look of it is very light and it's yellow. Smell of hop and of corn. Remind me of the coors light it the Molson Canadian.
The smell of it. Nothing too different from the Canadian. Very similar.
Now the taste of it: well nothing to different than a Molson Canadian a bit lighter. A bit if a different taste to it. It's a bit plastic taste to it.
So overall would I recommend it ?? For man No, for women maybe. If you know what beer taste like don't drink that crap. But for women who likes to drink beer but wanna drink low alcohol percentage and wanna have low calories this beer is made for u."
Worst,Molson Canadian 67,3.25,"Yes, you are all right about a lot of things.
This is a very light beer.
This is meant to be a very light beer.
If you are going to a barbecue, or party--like function, and have to drive home, 3 of these has less alcohol than 2 of another standard beer.
If you are working around the house on the weekend, on a hot day, this beer is perfect, because it tastes more like beer than most other light beers, and you can still get your work done.
I actually prefer this to regular Canadian. Had a Canadian the other day by mistake, and wondered how I ever used to drink it.
No, this is not a splendid taste experience, and there are no special food pairings for this beer, but this is a great beer to have in your fridge, if you feel like having A beer, but you know you will need your faculties later on.
Not bad as a summer patio beer, or a business lunch beer, or a performing on stage at a summer festival beer.
This is not a great beer, but it has a place in your beer arsenal."
Worst,Molson Canadian 67,1.74,"Molson 67 looks like a beer with less calories - less of everything for that matter. It is so markedly pale as to have virtually no colour at all on some angles. Despite lively bubbles it fails to support any kind of head. It looks anorexic; if it were your friend you'd be concerned for its health.

Molson can spend all the money in the world to advertise and market each of their brands differently, but so long as they keep using inferior ingredients they'll all smell the same. And not even the cleverest commercial or slogan ever conceived will make them smell good. This may have half the calories but it has every bit the foul stench.

Indeed, like most of this brewery's beers, there's little of anything tasteful or notably ""beer-like"" about it; bubbles and water are obvious but malt and hops are imperceptible. It's no surprise that this drinks like a combination of corn syrup and pool water; after all, it is loaded with industrial (possibly chemical) adjuncts and produced on a massive, highly mechanized scale.

Let's be clear though: the magnitude of a brewery's operations is not what affects quality; in fact, larger operations tend to be more consistent and have far better quality control. Molson, however, is not in the business of making good beer - they're in the business of selling a lot of beer. And when this is the priority it's no surprise the products taste like watered-down HFCS.

The only thing that makes Molson 67 halfway swallowable is that, true to theme, it has much less of that artificially sweet, off-putting, corn syrup-like flavour than standard strength lagers of equivalent nature. Some, however, will feel the diluted profile is a detriment. It didn't have to be that way; alcohol and flavour are not necessarily proportional. I've had plenty of delicious and characterful beers in the 3% range - this, however, is not one of them.

If you’re holding your breath waiting for Molson to make a good beer, be prepared to turn blue in the face and die. Unlike their chief rival, Labatt, who actually took the hint when their profits started diminishing and responded with the respectable Alexander Keith Hop Series, Molson seems content chasing one fad after another and spending all their resources on marketing rather than offering a half-decent product."
Worst,Molson Canadian 67,2.6,"473 mL can picked up at TBS; served well chilled. I had this a few years back - and by 'had', I mean an agent left a bunch of free samples behind at the liquor store I used to work at, which was around the time that this beer was initially being launched. As I chugged the contents of a single ice cold bottle just prior to clocking in for my shift, I was pretty sure it was the wateriest, most flavourless beer I'd ever had - and unsurprisingly, I haven't been inclined to return to it until now, when a lack of alternatives has left me scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Pours a clear, pale straw yellow colour, topped with one finger's worth of soapy bone-white head. Very active carbonation; streams of bubbles constantly rush to the surface, reinforcing the head for at least a few minutes before it finally recedes into a thin cap and collar. Lots of lacing, too - one of the better-looking light beers I've had in recent memory. It has that generic 'cheap yellow lager' aroma, with no real distinguishing traits to speak of... corn husk, a little grainy with some vaguely sweet features, and not much else. Typical of the style.

Weak, diluted flavour, but not quite as tasteless as some of the other 'low cal' lagers I've tried in the past. There's a light brushing of grainy malts and corn that vanishes from the palate almost as quickly as it appears. No real wheat malt presence (the label mentions both barley and wheat), and no real aftertaste - just some light malts, carbonation, and then it's gone. Thin-bodied and very watery, with heavy carbonation levels that give this brew a spritzy, lively feel in the mouth.

Final Grade: 2.6, a forgettable C-. A re-tasting of Molson Canadian 67 hasn't changed my opinion much - this is still an exceptionally watery, bland lager - but compared to certain other low-calorie light lagers (e.g. Sleeman Clear or Michelob Ultra), this one at least resembles an actual beer, so I can't grade it too harshly. These low-cal lagers aren't brewed for the average BA; they are brewed for calorie-counting women and people who don't like the taste of beer. Seen through the context of those goggles, this is at least a decent light lager, but there's no reason that anyone who falls outside of those categories really needs to bother with this."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1.55,"I used to drink this all the time when I was a legit alcoholic.
The good thing about this stuff is that it was about $1.45 for a big can and two or three of them could get you really drunk.
The bad part is every thing else. This beer is gross in every way, with the taste and smell being the worst.
You can smell the actual alcohol mixed with a gross almost putrid stench.
The taste is overwhelmingly sour in the worst way possible. It's not ""sweet"" sour like with candy, it's BAD sour like something has spoiled. Absolutely bad."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,2.36,"Camo Black Ice brewed by Camo Brewing Company,with an ABV of 10.50% This malt liquor pours out of a 24oz can into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a small white head. The head to this brew, goes away fast. There is is some real super thin lacing to this brew, it kinda sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is Strong with Malts an grains an lots of alcohol notes. This brew has the look an smell of most malt liquors on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You pick up a lot of alcohol notes mixed with Malts and grains. The body of Camo Black Ice is heavy. This is alot smoother than the Camo Sliver style of this brew. Still a little rough around the edges. Nit my first choice , but if you need need a one an done kinda brew, this might fit the bill. The mouth feel is Bold, Alcohol, Malts, Clean, An Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Camo Black Ice a 2.5 out of 5. Camo Brewing Company, did a decent job with this Malt Liquor."

overall: 5"
Worst,Camo Black Ice,3.3,"In terms of ABV, the equivalent of more than four typical AAL for $1.19 for a 24 ounce can. Given what you could reasonably expect given that, I don't see how someone could complain -- indeed, how someone couldn't find this better than anticipated.

Still -- well, it's Camo. Whadjya expect?"
Worst,Camo Black Ice,4.07,"24 FL. OZ. can
Served in a pokal glass

This beer pours a beautiful straw color and is topped with a mountain of effervescent, white head that leaves some really nice spider web lacing.

The smell takes me back to when I was a child and my dad, who raised sheep, went to the local feed mill and had grain milled for the lambs. That smell is reminiscent in this wonderful elixir. I also get wisps of floral hops along with a healthy dose of alcohol.

The first few gulps make me winch due to the booziness. Once I get used to it I begin to pick out sweet grain notes along with some stiff alcohol.

It is quite thin which is typical for this underrated and undervalued style of beer.

This beer is not for the faint of heart. It is made to deliver a lot of bang for the buck, and believe me it does. Being a connoisseur of some of the finest malt liquors in the United States, I find this beer amazing. I love the strong taste. I love the fact that it is 10.5% abv. I love the fact that it is $1.79 for a 24oz can. I just wish I could find it locally. I had to buy it on a recent trip to Detroit and tote it home to enjoy after falling in love with it at my hotel room at 1:20am with a bag of White Castles. Craft brewers need to explore this style more or exclusively."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1.34,"In my 3 years of legal drinking i have drank at least 200 brands/types of beers. This is the worst ive had. Taste is a mixture of nail polish remover and apple juice. Smell is of a typical high gravity but stronger. Poured about 1 ounce of this beer into a shotglass to observe its pale yellow color with a high white head that disappeared quickly. Drank the other 23 ounces from the can because honestly nobody that typically drinks this beer would pour it into a glass. This beer has one purpose in life and that is to get people drunk at 10.5% alcohol. However even rating it in that sense it is a terrible beer. Steel reserve, Hurricane and side pocket are all similar in alcohol content and price and they all have a much more tolerable to even slightly enjoyable taste. So realistically im not sure why Camo Black Ice even has a place on the beer store shelf."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,3.52,"Clear gold with one finger of short lived head. Some lacings.
Smell is typical M.L. not too bad for the style.
Taste is malty some brewers syrup hops are hard to find. No bad flavors and alcohol is well hidden.
Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Finish is mostly sweet and not too dry.
Overall a tasty M.L. for such a high abv. Would I buy it again? Maybe but just one 24 ounce can."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1.25,"I've tasted a lot of beers in my time, but this has to be among the worst. I know some people mentioning a head, but it had very little for me. The smell was okay, but the taste was like pure alcohol with a hint of apple to it. If there were any hops in it, they must have floated to the top and been scraped off because I could taste none. The ONLY reason I gave it more than a 1.0 is because you could easily hold your breath and guzzle the stuff down---little carbonation or aftertaste. Skip it!"
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1.25,"This very harsh brew gets tastier as one drinks more of it. It has a strong alcohol smell and a golden appearance with a tolerable head. The flavor is strongly alcoholic and harsh. Camo Black Ice is stinging in the mouth and tough to take at first. However, by the time I was about half way through the 24 oz. can (poured in a pint glass), I began to enjoy it. I prefer milder beers for daily drinking, but this would be something to have from time to time. I felt woozy for about three to four hours after drinking this. It’s rough.

RJT"
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1,"I'm sorry, I haven't even wrote a review in a long time but I just had to log in to write this.
This is with out a doubt the WORST BEER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Its even an insult to call it beer or malt liquor because it is not in the same league as any other one I've tried.
Imagine taking old dirty wet socks and a bunch of leaves that you raked up, putting them together and adding lake water and letting it ferment and soak up all the flavor. Thats what this tastes like. It looks horrible, smells horrible, tastes, mouthfeel overall horrible.
Now for all the winos out there. This stuff is potent and will get you drunk very quickly so if thats your main goal and you can tolerate the taste, more power to you.
Note that Camo Silver Ice is 10.6% so just a bit stronger if your looking for that bang for your buck.
All in all awful beverage. You've been warned."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,2.4,"one of those beers that was given to me as a gag gift awhile back, sat in my fridge for some time, and finally got opened out of curiosity. the looks of it are really nice actually, clear golden in color with an inch of reasonably well lasting head, pure white, and leaving lacing as i swirl it. the nose isn't bad either, not at all. slightly stale and rather sweet barley and dextrose aromas, and some slight metallic oddness, but nothing way off, and not at all super boozy. the flavor is another story. the first sip is rather pleasant, i surprisingly taste grain first. it gets worse from their though. the second sip reveals a ton of sweetness, unnatural and very dense, while the third sip shows just how alcoholic it is. its a mess, and downright revolting by the third sip, more can than beer at this point. honestly on the whole its better than anticipated for so long, but the huge can and huge booze makes me timid. this would be warm by the end of it, which totally turns my guts around.carbonation is fine though the body is sweet and big. lager yeast flashes in, an odd appearance, and I'm wondering why so much residual sugar, just sloppy technique by whatever factory produced this thing. serves a purpose i guess, but not a purpose i hope to ever have..."
Worst,Camo Black Ice,1.42,"Picked up in Wyoming mostly for morbid curiosity. How good can it be? Got to see some bad countries on the Earth to appreciate how great most of North America and Europe are compared to most of Africa.

But I have had Super Brew 15 in my mouth so I know bad when I put it in my mouth.

Poured in a glass just to be fair and like most malt liquor it does a passable job at looking like a lager. Clear gold with a small momentary white colored head.

Smells fruity as in fusel alcohol from beer fermented hot and fast. Malty and toffee candy. It is a bit spicy and I got the smell nailed. This smells like spiced caramel apple. There is a strong apple butter scent to this. Might actually give this some credit except I know what Fusel Alcohol does for hangovers. But to be honest doesn't smell that bad.

Moment of truth the taste.

Starts of thin and boozy. Tastes a lot like apple cider. And that is about it, tastes like Vodka and apple juice.

Mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation boils off pretty quick.

Overall this is a beer meant for hardcore alcoholics and college dorm parties.

But you already knew what you were buying a bad beer when you purchased it.

6 OZ drank 18 OZ to clean out the drain."

And,you know what?Drink this stuff ICE cold,and thirty-five years later,life is still grand.I love IPAs and Belgian anythings more than any human on earth,but a cheap,ice cold Milwaukees Best Ice or Premium still tastes like it should.

No TAX! it was 14.99 flat and it was in my shopping cart! The taste of this beer could be worse, but for needing to get drunk because of alcohol dependence this is the stuff! I was immature and not knowing what to drink in my crappy spot. I will never drink this beer ever again, because the smell is something that of fermentation gone wrong. This is not a sipper this is a chugger because if you buy this you are already accustomed to the taste and are drinking like a hedonist. This is get drunk beer, not for the sophistication. This Frat House white trash beer. Do not drink this."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.62,"Pours a golden yellow, smell is faint malts, grain, slight sourness like most ice beers, just slightly harsher than the others.

Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1.81,"Well, it's happening. Beast ice poured an amber copper in the glass and left a little lacing. Nose is slightly vinous, with elements of corn syrup and cheap cereal grain with the green apple flaw also shining through. Get some corn flakes on the tongue along with low quality vodka. Carbonation falls flat in the glass,but somehow maintains slightly more fizz from the can. It's a tough drink, this one. Used to slurp em back as a teenager but doubt this 24 oz will be finished"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,3.58,"This beer was rated within the style
(Enjoyed from cans poured into pint glasses)

Excellent example of a regular beer, round mouthfeel with invitingly soft smell and look. The taste is rich, mostly corn adj. and sweetness with a slight bitterness from a nice blend of malt and hop. For the excellent price and ABV, you cannot go wrong."
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1.52,"Absolute yuck.

This pours a dirty looking straw yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

It smells like sweet corn, rainwater, and booze - certainly not the most inviting thing ever.

This is cheap dumpster juice, and you shouldn't really expect anything from it. It's too sweet and contains a weird boozy astringency, even though it's under 6%. There's absolutely nothing to recommend here.

This is light bodied, slick, and gross, with very little drinkability. I can't imagine people buy this in bulk, on purpose.

This is really quite gross, and shouldn't even be looked at in the store. Don't buy. DON'T BUY!"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1.98,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that died down a bit, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of corn adjuncts and fusel alcohol are present in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell but the flavors of fusel alcohol are stronger.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and clean on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: The fusel alcohol in the smell and taste of this beer are somewhat detracting from the drinkability of this beer.

Serving type: can"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,1.19,"Basically, this is THE cheapest beer you can buy (16$ a 30 case/ 53 cents a can) and to no surprise it's arguably the worst. It labels itself a lager but it's pretty much malt liquor, more widespread to the public that way. The flavor can downright cause most normal people to gag. Don't get me wrong, I've shotgunned hundreds of these and the stuff will get you blackout wasted but it... tastes... terrible. Anything is better than ""Beast"" unless you're just that damn cheap or a flat out masochist writhing with the hatred of self and the world. Bring this stuff to a party if you don't want anyone drinking your beer except for other like-minded Beast unicorns. You might even make a friend who shares your passion for poor choices and self hatred. You never know."

L: polished-clear, gold liquid; steady off-white foam pad on pour, tight, dimpled... eventually, just a thin collar hangs, but does leave some snotty splotches of lace

S: moist diaper, fermenting dough, soft cider and/or clove spice, light note of sweet cereal... maybe a faint whiff of booze... overall intensity mild-moderate

T: more of that cider element up front, immediate bready malt follow-through, dry malty aftertaste... subtle corn meal underbelly?... halfway through, and it's straight-up malt liquor, with a long-lasting flavor shine

F: white-caps sudsy roll to its texture, slight boozy-oily drag in the finish... that tiny touch of residual viscosity (legs?) and sedate warmth gives this a bit of substance, something to savor; back end and bottom are fairly cut dry too - lovely dynamics

O: can't recall having seen this around here, certainly no 16-25 oz'ers to be had - got this in MD, maybe find it in PA... it's a shame because this is a fine lil malt liquor - it's at least on par with some of my favorites... I could go for another right now (1556)"
Worst,Milwaukee's Best Ice,4.36,"Looks medium gold with a substantial white head. Smell is slightly sweet, grain, and corn adjunct. Taste is smooth semi sweet, medium bitterness and semi dry finish. I’m at a loss to understand the low score, this is very underrated. For a value priced econo beer this is as good as it gets. Except for the slight adjunct flavor I can’t find much wrong with this. It’s not light or diet friendly but I think it tastes great. Must be kept very cold though. Cheers

UPDATE: 02/20/20
Well, sorry to disappoint but I still like this beer. $2.00 for a 32 oz. can. I still come up with the same smell/flavor profiles. It’s probably too much for you little sippers out there so I understand why you rate it so low. If your a normal manly man this beer will definitely satisfy. It’s way better than a typical malt liquor so don’t be scared to give it a shot. Make sure you get it as cold as possible, it is an “ice” beer.

Chasing down some little Caesars, not my favorite pizza but in Jasper, tx for a hunting trip, choices were limited. As far as the MB Ice goes, I still think it’s ok. $1.59 for a 32 oz can.

L - Goldenrod. Quickly dissolving one-finger pale white head.
S - Lime peel, barley, and for some odd reason, Skittles. Brings memories of summer.
T - Very heavy lime flavor, minus the tartness. Hints of grass. Very mild hop bite - enough to somewhat balance the presence of basic malt flavor.
F - Carbonation is definitely there, but almost not noticeable (unless you drink multiple cans). Very smooth, crisp, and refreshing.
O - For what it is, it's pretty solid. Definitely something you'd only drink with friends. Memories of summer parties, fishing, and beachside bonfires come to mind the second I smelled this. The taste was surprisingly not bad, but I wish it had more body to it (I know, it's pretty demanding to ask that for a ""light"" beer, but it's worth noting). Overall, it's a damn good replacement if you didn't want to drink a Mtn. Dew for whatever reason."

F: light-bodied but not thin; quick-finishing, soft sudsy lift, bit of latent gas... kind of on par with a regular adjunct lager

O: all that's missing is a packet of sugar and we might have a lemon muffin lager here... as far as light lagers go, I could do this again - not bad at all, actually relatively flavorful (1558)"
Worst,Michelob Light,2.47,"Michelob Light is a light beer that tastes more like beer than most light beers. Nicely carbonated, without much of a ""burn"" on the tastebuds. Just a tiny hint of sweetness to the flavor. If you're an IPA guy (or gal), it'll be far too weak for your preference. But it's not as watery as, say, Busch Light. Goes down smooth after a day of yardwork, and a good beer to enjoy with a burger and fries. Very inoffensive. But at around $12-$13 a twelver, a bit more expensive than some light beers. But, it also tastes just a little more satisfying than most light beers. It's also a little better from a glass bottle than from a can. It's not amazing, but it's definitely not bad."
Worst,Michelob Light,2.85,"I like this brew ok, it almost gets to the average of 3. Fuller with more flavor than the other big macro lights. Overall right with BL and CL for me."
Worst,Michelob Light,2,Pale yellow gold color. Creamy white head. Fragrant chalky malt aroma. Light grainy malt flavor upfront. Highly carbonated. Slightly sour mid taste. Light hop finish with a brief dry aftertaste.
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.19,"16 ounce can, thanks to my friend Laura for this one! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a light reddish color with about an inch or so light pink head that didn't stick around for too long. Small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but also subtle. The brew smells like tomato, salt, lime and a bit of clamato. Taste is similar to the aroma, but I do think the clamato and tomato have more of a kick here. There's also a bit of celery and grainy flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy enough to drink. Overall I'd have to say this is average. It's not bad but not great either. I've had other Bloody Mary/Chelada style drinks before and there's others I like a lot more than this. But with that being said, this one isn't offensive at all and I'd drink it again. Probably wouldn't buy it for myself though."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.46,"Look, this is not your homemade Michelada. No one should get this expecting the flavors of a high quality bloody mary or something like that. Most of these reviews seem to be from lager drinkers who like flavored beer but don't understand what this is supposed to be. That being said, if you want an incredible hangover cure that has more of an msg taste than a salt taste (at least by comparison to a bloody or a homemade michelada) but is well balanced with the acid from the lime and tomato, this is your thing. The salt content is there enough that you will taste it, but very much more in a way that will make you grab this after a long bike ride rather than a day of sitting around. That being said, they're heavy enough in fill but light enough in alcohol that a couple of these will last you a day of sipping in the sun with no worries about driving home later. All in all, as a michelada lover and someone who has developed my own recipe based on tommy sandoval's, this is the one I keep coming back to when I need to remind myself what it's like, this is the base of the flavors that define this ""cocktail"" and it is wonderful for what it is. Chuck your own couple dashes of hot sauce or cut it with more beer, this mich is a utility, and I can respect that about it. Is it 5/5? no fuckin way, but I would challenge you to find a better canned michelada."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.03,A lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. This is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market. The clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious. My only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor I sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better.
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.27,"This one pours a weird and dead looking light red color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like an old fetid tide pool, salt, warm rain water, pepper spice, and ketchup.

I don’t know who this is made for, but it’s certainly not made for me. The back end is weirdly sweet tomato ketchup type flavors but also with an unpleasant spice to it. I don’t mind a bit of brine in certain beers, but it just feels so old and nasty with the clam juice in here.

This is simultaneously super watery but also uncomfortably thick at times, with a weird slickness. It just kind of hurts going down.

I could barely stomach about 3oz of this thing. It’s just not my thing, not at all. I hate it."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4,"(25 oz can, code 19236; purchased cold single... poured into a Gibraltar glass)

L: cloudy, pinkish liquid; looks like a raspberry wit? but without any foam, suds of which explode and vanish on the pour... with subsequent pours, the murk gets murkier, and some nasty, spitty, tomato-y foam smears do cling, tomato specks abound

S: moderately-intense emanation of tomato juice and limey brine on the nose, however, little if any 'clam'; smells innocent enough, not necessarily off-putting, unless you have a depressingly dull diet... certainly has a fresh, floral overtone

T: tomato juice, mellow undercurrent of grain-soupy adjunct lager, light-moderate sea mist, barely a kiss of citrus color, but a rather forward peppery bite I wasn't expecting... almost a subtle tomato paste-y sweetness around the edges, but thankfully not sweetly-flavored like caramel or sugar... pepper and lightly malted tomato nectar prevalent in the aftertaste

F: mildly spritzy carbonation coupled with the peppery bite makes for an enlivening, burn/sting upon the tongue/palate, mellow heat building an embery fire... take the flavors away, and it's arguably rather wit-smooth in its textures up front, and relatively prickly-hot at the back like perhaps an egregiously coriander-ed extra-triple

O: should I be surprised that I enjoyed and was fascinated by this? - the recipe works well but, to my taste, I'd prefer a little more brine and maybe some umami-funk to give it more depth... not sure I'd quite go gangbusters experimenting on cocktail-ish flavor doctorings with this, but I can already think of a variety of ways to accent flavors here: lime wedge(s), (more) clam juice, anchovy oleo, celery salt, spicy mango, tequila chaser, et al... overtly Bloody Mary-like, noticeably/deliciously malty, and applicable within countless culinary scenarios - needs and begs to be paired with charred meats, oily carbs, spicy fruits etc etc... definitely going back for another - wow! (1639)"
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.92,"Blegh. The taste of tomato is so strong, it doesn't even taste like tomato. It's worse than a V8. It looks decent. but tastes like clam juice. Do not drink."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.74,"The best chelada bud makes. You get 25 ounces of tomato based clam beer beverage for $3, what more can you ask for? I'm an ipa guy, but the balance of spice, clamato, and budweiser creates a vortex of euphoria that smoothly slides down your throat. Look is typical of a chelada/michelada; off red/pink with floating bits of tomato. Smell is very tomato forward with the typical malt smell of budweiser. Taste is amazing, a perfect balance of spice and refreshing light beer, along with a decently high carbonation this is a great summertime beer..I drink a lot of these after being on the water all day, but also make great drinks after skiing too. A great all around beverage"
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.32,"Any flavored beer in a big can you gotta be skeptical. When my friend showed me this beer I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I like Budweiser but only on draft at a ballgame. It seems this is a perfect combination. I've mixed my own bud and tomato juice with a little worsteshire and lime, it's killer as well. But you can get 2 of the 25 oz. for $6, perfect. Great for hangovers. I can only drink 2 of them at the most as they taste packed with sodium. Then I switch to regular beer. Cheers!"
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,5,I can't get enough of these red beer's ! I have bought out every local storeal around me and it look's like I may have to make my own for a bit ! I wish the distributor's would push these a little harder in our area . It's typical that you find something you really like and there is a very limited supply ! Awesome flavor and I wuld make a permanent place for it in my garage fridge if I could find more than a can or twould at a time !
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,5,"I love everything about this beer. I didn't even want to try it because I hate all flavored beers. For me it boils down to the fact that my palate is geared so much toward savory than sweet. I also love a bloody mary and beer. I like every single flavor in this beverage. This is the only beer ""cocktail "" I have ever enjoyed. Other than this I strictly enjoy a mostly along the lines of a black and tan. On occasion a strong stout hits the spot."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.93,"I absolutely love this beverage. Now, I'm a boy from Texas, and I've been eating spicy food all my life, so to me a spicy tomato beer is par for the course.

I'd take this over a High Life anyday. Champagne of beers? No thank you. Give me that michelada knock off.

Now then, if you're a Northerner the advice that follows may not be for you, but if you're a spice man, like myself, then you've already done this, but if you fall somewhere inbetween I strongly suggest to you to dose this beer with a bit of hot sauce. Now, the type of hot sauce you can put on it can be almost anything. Tobasco will work, give it a bit more of a vinegar punch... But I've gotten into this Yucateca hot sauce, and that works like a charm.

It's great in the mornings, great at night, and great at lunch with some tacos from the local taco truck. Barbacoa especially.

Stay thirsty, my friends."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,5,"best ever , i have never tasted anything better on this aspect. limey flavor with clam & tons of tomato beer mix. Budweiser Chelada's are the best hands down!!! i can't go a week without having at least 4 25 oz chelada's"
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.68,"Firstly, don’t call this “beer”. It’s a beverage. I like tomato, spice, & the salinity of clam juice. So, by me it’s a hit. Not as a regular indulgence, only as the mood hits. I’m talking about the “Bud” version, there is a “Bud Light” version. As with anything “Bud Light”, just say no.
Enjoyed with a WaWa soft pretzel, good combo."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,2,I bought this because we need to try anything new we see and wow were we disappointed. It tasted like a watered down V8 light beer mixture It was just so hard to drink we were actually going to dump it out.
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,4.02,"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 2/24/2018. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a minimal foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. No lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Good appearance. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt notes; with big strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/saline/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Lightly increasing pleasant lingering pepper heat through the glass. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. This is the best one in this style I have had. Was even better than the bud light version, very similar but with more clean malt presence. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Budweiser and Clamato flavors; with plenty of malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.98,"Remember one of the BA rules “don’t rate styles of beer that you don’t like”. It seems as though people who don’t like a Chelada or beer ‘n clam as we call it in Canada are rating it hence the low rating.

I’ve been mixing my own beer ‘n clams since I was a teenager and love it! This is just coveniant as you don’t need to mix your own. Taste is great if you love the cocktail but the price (here in Canada anyway) is too expensive. It’s much cheaper to buy a cheep lager and mix your own but I buy these all the time for camping and fishing trips where I don’t want to bring cups, beer and a big jug of clam with me.

It is what it is. It’s beer and Clamato juice so if you don’t like beer and clamato than obviously you won’t like this drink but for my fellow beer ‘n clam drinkers, drink up! You’ll love it."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.18,You have three health benefits one alcohol one tomato juice and third clam broth . Even though they don't mix but u have to look at it health benefits.
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.15,"This is going be a polarizing beer cocktail. First, you've got to love both beer and bloody mary cocktails. If you just like beer then this is not for you. This is a pretty good blending of two disparate, yet compatible, drinks. The Bud version is infinitely better than the Bud Light version so I never buy the BL variety. What it is a nice refreshing beer cocktail suited well for the warmer weather months...if you also like your Bloody Mary cocktails but want more refreshing carbonation. Here's the deal as I see it. It's more beer-ish if you will and not unlike flavored brews. I could stand more zing and more tomato as such. But, it's refreshing and drinkable. No weird notes if your in for spicy tomato juice and enjoy some carbonation. It comes in either 16 or 25 ounce cans in my area and the 'big boy"" is all I want and is just right on a hot summer evening for a change of pace. Sure, a lot of folks will gag and I get that. However, if you are a well-rounded drink enthusiast this can have a place in your warmer weather rotation. The only thing I'd do if I was AB is to drop the Bud Light version and have two Bud renditions: this one and a bad@$$ BOLD one that is 6% or more ABV with a real wallop of pepper and tomato."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,1.03,"Shared 25 fl.oz. can at local tasting. Cloudy orange to red colour, hardly any head. Aroma of cheap ketchup and stale seawater ponds. Sickly flavour of stale ketchup, salt and spices. Undrinkable."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.95,"Let me start by saying this is not really beer - it's a beer cocktail. It ain't a lager, ipa, pale ale, stout etc etc - it's just beer mixed with spicy tomato juice. Sooooo, why did I give it a 4 you might ask???? I happen to love tomato juice, I love anything spicy and as you can imagine . . . I love beer sooooo this stuff (though it ain't really a beer) is super tasty IMO. It tastes like fizzy spicy tomato juice with a slight hint of beer. I have always seen this at the local liquor store and I never bothered to buy it but one day - in a moment of weakness - I said to myself ""what the hey - let's give it a try"" and lo and behold - I love it."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.75,Tall 25 oz can (free ounce!). No head really. Looks like a bloody mary. Tastes pretty similar to a lighter version of a bloody mary. Tomatoes and some peppers. It's pretty much what you'd expect it to be. I like it for what it is. But I really enjoy bloodies.
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.55,"Backlog. 24 oz can. I love this stuff! I don’t care what anyone says! I never thought I’d give anything Anheuser-Busch makes such a high rating, but I do love a red beer every now and then, especially on a hangover. AB has made the perfect red beer in my opinion. *blows raspberries at all the beer snobs*

Edit: I wrote that review in 2009, and all these years later, I've found a much better michelada: Modelo Chelada Tamarindo Picante."
Worst,Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,3.09,"Great morning beer or hangover helper. pretty rough otherwise. Spicy tomato juice and a background of cheap beer makes this one go to the bottom but like I said, the morning after cure to get you going again !!"
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,2.55,"Neighbor offered at a block party.

Look - From the bottle, clear golden with a small fizzy cap on top.

Smell - Weakly grainy with the namesake fruits in moderate amounts.

Taste - Grains turn up, rice adjunct becomes more apparent. Fruits stay moderate.

Feel - Watery light body with a spritzy carbonation. Swallows clean and finishes rapidly.

Overall - Was exactly what I was expecting. Michelob Ultra in itself is useless. More expensive than high life, with less flavor and alcohol. This variation is better than the base beer due to the added fruit aspects. Can't complain."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,2.3,"Sigh . . . why did I do this. Hmm . . . So that doesn't count as a proper review. Well, it looks like yellow water with raspberry flavoring added what is necessary."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,1,"What the what?!?! Who thought this up?!?!?! Disgusting! I am not against fruit flavors in my beer, but this does not work on any level. The flavors clash like a train derailing on my taste buds.

Would Drink Again: No
Would Purchase Again: No"
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,1.25,"My wife picked this up for herself. I tried one. Worst thing I've ever tasted. First sip tasted like slightly fruited seltzer water. Then the fruit went away (quickly) and I was left with a tingle as if I just drank plain seltzer or Club soda. Vile stuff! I don't drink those flavored sparkling waters or Vitamin water etc, but I imagine this is what they taste like. I would have rated this 1 but gave a little extra for at least having a tiny bit or fruit aroma. Barely."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,4.47,"Light fruity beers are not for everyone. Personally, I can't stand hoppy bitter beers and that seems to be the trend with craft brewers in the US. I prefer lighter sweeter beers. Michelob's Pomegranate Rasberry beer has been my favorite staple beer for years! I love this beer! It's light, sweet and refreshing. Perfect for hot summer days. If I am camping or at a friend's BBQ and plan to be drinking for hours on end, this is the beer I bring. Most hard core beer snobs will cringe at this, but I love to add orange juice and make a beermosa with this beer. Like I said, this beer isn't for everyone and I expect many to turn their nose up at any beer than is light and sweet, but if this is the style your taste buds prefer you will enjoy it."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Fruit Pomegranate Raspberry,1.55,"Sampled tonight on 5/25/14. Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured into a vintage Michelob thumbprint glass goblet.

Pours a very light straw yellow in color with a very small fizzy white head. No lacing is seen to mention. The aroma is better than the taste and is of some sweet fruits. The taste is well...really bad! Like drinking a lightly flavored club soda or seltzer water. Way to much carbonation, and even more than other Bud products. Overall, I will not be drinking this one again!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,3,"Olde Tyme review here from circa 1994.
OK just arrived in the USA with wife poor as f&ck. Got some dilapidated duplex in Hapeville GA. half the houses were boarded up..that kinda place.
Found pout St Ides and OE800 40s at 79 cents were the drink of the neighborhood which i happily joined on a Friday evening.'
Came back to work and my wife was smiling..and handed me a 6'er of this beer Milwaukee Ice..$1.99 a six..and you know compared the MLs it was a nice beer..have to tell you summer of 94 went through a ton of this stuff..actually sad it is gone!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,4.1,"(16 oz can, OCT1419; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip)

L: brilliantly-clear, pale yellow-amber liquid; rather tall, 2-finger high, relatively dense, white foam... slow collapse of foam, rocky center, then incredibly thick, crusty collar left, actually some long bands of lace... looks superb!

S: expected lightly-spiced, doughy aromas, with perhaps faint almond, vanilla notes... nutty, granola grain most dominant, but overall potency is a touch too mellow

T: richly malty, but relatively dry on the back end, not to mention that overtone of lightly caramel-y nuttiness, almost like a biscotto... a couple sips in, and a semi-bold, mildly herbal, cooling bitterness takes hold in the aftertaste, faint sweetish booze hanging in the back; balanced well... vaguely industrial Belgian tripel esters/phenols - great in a malt liquor, but lame in an actual tripel

F: as a malt liquor, this has a perfectly silky-smooth, lightly-luscious body, with a hearty quiet afterglow - for an AAL, it may have too rich of an initial contact, but falls short of any residual syrupy drag, though it ain't bone dry either... just divine, good grief; sipper or slurper, it does both

O: either one of the best ice beers I've had (if not the best), or a perfect marriage was made between liquid (and temp) and glass... I got a sort of 2-for-1 deal on these cans - tempted to have the other right after this, but I may need a nap after (1516)"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,3.31,"(Poured into a small tasting glass)

Thick, white, frothy head. Lots of bubbles. Yellow-golden. Clear. Spotty lacing.

Aroma: citrusy/fruity??? Sweet, indistinguishable grain. A little breadiness.

The flavor has some of that typical gummy ice beer flavor. Overall, the flavor is tepidly light, like the regular Old Milwaukee.

The mouthfeel is too thinly carbonated for the style.

The finish is crisp, refreshing, light and watery, and fairly dry."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,1.96,"Yellow pour with almost no head. Aroma was massively like fusel alcohol. Didn't come off like the beer ingredients. No malt, hop smells.

Taste was still harsh. There's some sweetness like corn in it. Drink this one cold. Lots of carbonation all over it. Gets a lot more bitter as it warms, and it isn't a hop flavor bitter."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,2.5,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has slight malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Ice,3.36,"Old Milwaukee Ice brewed by Pabst Brewing Company. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. Now keep in mind this an ICE brew with an ABV of 5.9. This ice brew has a lighter color than other ICE brews. The smell of this brew is ok nothing special but nothing bad. It smells like beer. The taste is strong at first but at the end it is smooth and rich. You pick up on the higer abv and some sweetness. The after taste is ok nothing bad about that. This brew goes down smooth. Old Milwaukee Ice is not the best I had but Not the worst by a long shot.Over all I giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5. I would pick up Old Milwaukee Ice again.
Also Keep in mind this brew is price is 1.19 plus tax. Not a Bad buy at all"
Worst,Miller Lite,3.55,"exceeds at being what it's made to be. it's a miller high life, but lighter. the finish leaves the same notes, yet looks the same in the glass. does make me yearn for a MGD."
Worst,Miller Lite,2.82,"Poured from a 12oz can best by Oct 10 2022

On the pour a nearly 2 finger lightly fizzy head formed and left some surprisingly decent lacing. Body is a darker golden straw carbonation is high but fine.

Aroma is malty, adjuncty, and has a bit of that cheap lager funk to it. I want to say I can detect hops similar to a pilsner but it's definitely leaning more toward cheap AAL. Not great, but for the style it's pretty good.

Taste is similar to MHL. A bit too sweet but relatively clean and light apart from the adjunct. Not a lot of bitterness but there is a very light hint. Not offensive not great but way better than coors light. This is light enough that I can taste carbonic acid like in a seltzer.

Feel is carbonated, relatively dry and easy drinking. A bit bigger than your average light beer, and with a longer finish. Completely average and it does its job.

Overall for a BMC light beer this is pretty good. Certainly not mind blowing but I'd get this again. Miller always seems to do better Than Bud and coors (even tho Miller is owned by coors in the US now but whatever)"
Worst,Miller Lite,2.67,"Got this from the neighbor after chatting on the fenceline in this heat. Anyway, let's see what I found.

Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is a crystal clear light gold color with a medium sized white head. The taste is of some hops and grain. Overall, not much but an okay beer if you drink it when it's really ice cold."
Worst,Miller Lite,3.89,"The best cheap lite beer hands down. At a gas station and need a beer? Miller Lite. At a party? Miller Lite. Need something cheap? Miller Lite. This beer is more dependable than an old honda. When they're cold its actually not bad at all, more flavor than a bud light without tasting like piss."
Worst,Miller Lite,3.21,"Probably the best lite/light beer I've tasted, carries a lot of the flavor profile and body of High Life (my fave AAL to date). These are free at a place I visited and I cannot complain. Would try again, but if I must use my money, I'm going with the real deal."
Worst,Miller Lite,3.56,"It sucks... I love it. My favorite shitty beer, it's lite and it avoids the pisswater trope that these kinds of beers fall into. Lot of good memories with this garbage"
Worst,Miller Lite,4.06,"This is the beer that finally made me cave in and make an account on this website after seeing the great injustice of the overall rating people on this site have been giving it. If you’re rating this low for taste or appearance or whatever, you’re COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT, and your friends have a separate group chat that you’re not in.

As another reviewer said - serve ‘‘em cold, and keep ‘‘em coming. You aren’t going to find a better popular light beer. This stuff hits the spot every time, it’s the 1999 Toyota Corolla of beer."
Worst,Miller Lite,3.44,For 100 calories this is a solid choice relative to other options in terms of light beer! Although it’s only at 4.2% it still has enough body in the overall flavor. This beer is always a good fallback when looking for something that isn’t on the pricier side and it is a good choice as a volume beer
Worst,Miller Lite,4.4,"This is one of the best 100 calorie per 12 oz beers I've ever had.
Of course there are times when I want something stronger..but there are times for me when a beer like this is just right.
I'm not going to bore you with some flowery and pretentious review where I tell you that I taste notes of hazel nuts and amaranth.

Worst,Miller Lite,1.72,"A: Cheerful gold color. Watery thin head. Plenty of carbonation.

S: Malt, bread, grain.

T: Lacking. Bland. Light taste of grain. Malt.

M: Watery, thin, no substance.

O: Standard, watery, thin beer. Great for teenagers."
Worst,Miller Lite,1.2,"Why people would spend extra money to drink a can of carbonated water is beyond me. Because that is exactly what it tastes like.
Smell: There is no smell
Taste: It tastes like carbonated water but worse. The most prominent flavor is the taste of corn syrup/metallic tinge. Idk all the ingredient that are put in here BC Miller does not list them, but something tastes funky. You can taste the artificial syrup taste you get from cheap beer. So overall, carbonated water actually has a more pleasant taste than this.
Mouthfeel: None to speak of, just like water.
Overall, this is the kind of beer people drink who don't like the taste of beer. BC it doesn't taste like beer. Kids likely drink this stuff to get smashed. However, the ABV is so low you would have to smash 5 of these in a row just to get a decent buzz."
Worst,Miller Lite,4.64,What a go to beer...I've read dozens of reviews of beer on this site and finally opened an account...let's face it...Miller Lite is a classic...no fancy and cute names here...no heavy ABV that makes you want a mixed drink and say to He// with it...nope this is American beer for Americans...great anytime...with great taste and no bull shi/....

Worst,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1,"While I am not aware of the legal classification that governments what is or isn't a malt liquor but I am sure the guidelines are not very strict.

The aroma is a pungent sugary sweet corn scent, mixed with a malty dank alcoholic warmth.
From the first sip you will realize that is marketed as less of a beverage and more of a means to reach intoxication.
Sugary, cereal mixed with corn make up the body, then hot gross sweetness like you get acid reflux.

Smells almost like rubbing alcohol. Tastes like the surgeon general's warning. Unless you are on very hard times and someone has offered you this for free, please avoid this and stop buying this. This is no good reason why this is produced. Far worse than Olde English, just a note/ reference point."

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and only faintly fizzy off-white head, which leaves some random splotchy lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates.

It smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, dextrose, Corn Pops, white grape juice, and rubbing alcohol. The taste is bready and doughy, er, malt, simple syrup, white wine dregs, the water in which you boiled the corn, sugary booze, and some ethereal earthy and dead floral bitterness.

The carbonation is pretty unremarkable in its milquetoast frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and actually fairly smooth, with only the firewater essence maybe acting as the fly in the proverbial ointment, to wit. It finishes off-dry, the generic malt and muted frooty notes fixing for a lingering donnybrook.

Overall - yeppers, this is exactly what the doctor (a known quack, but still) ordered, and actually quite tolerable when fridge-cold. However, the honeymoon fades fast as things start to warm, so I'd say that puts this one smack dab dead center in the bullseye of this style, amirite?"
Worst,Colt 45 Strong Beer,1.5,"First sips, it's bad. A few sips later, it's so bad it's good. After a few more, it's so so-bad-it's-good that it circles right back round to plain bad again."
Worst,Colt 45 Strong Beer,2.25,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has malt hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent malt liquor"
Worst,Colt 45 Strong Beer,2.83,"This is a high gravity version of Colt, ABV is 8.5%. The cans says ""Colt 45 Malt Liquor High Gravity"" and ""WorksEveryTime"". I plan on mixing this into a Clamato beer cocktail, but will review the beer by itself.

A moderate pour from the tallboy can produces a short-lived one inch head. It does have some stick to it. The beer is a pale golden and lightly carbonated.

The aroma and flavor actually emits slight tomato notes, somewhat like some malty lagers I've tried. There's definitely a fruity alcohol aroma, and a little bit of a corny DMS aroma, but not much. A little sweetness and tang on the finish. The flavor is overall rather neutral and bland, with no hop characteristics to speak of. Except for the boozy fruitiness, the alcohol is pretty well hidden.

This really isn't that bad. Of course, there's nothing exciting but nothing repugnant either. I think it'll make a fine tomato beer cocktail."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.3,"It looks ok, smells ok, but tastes of watery corn syrup. I used to be ok with it when it was ice ice cold, thirsty, and wanted some abv. Now I only have one, because it's beer, 130 calories, and 6 abv. All in all a great concept, but this barely hits it in that delivery. In lieu of an Ultra, it works. As to beer to drink for the taste of a good beer, skip it."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.85,"Clear golden color, little head that fades to nothing quite quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is sweet and somewhat reminiscent of a wheat ale, very simple. Very little detectable hops, light malt character present. Not as sweet in flavor as in nose. Little flavor, some malt present, akin to a cheap white bread. Finish is very short. Refreshing, nothing wrong with it. Edit: drank a second one and realized I didn’t like it, odd plastic-y taste is really unappealing."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.7,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour very fizzy carbonation and a 1 finger head with almost no retention form then dissipate back to almost nothing. Body is a clear light golden straw.

Aroma is similar to standard Bud with a bit more going on. Very yeasty lager, but not as bad as standard bud, but it's still a bit tart and funky for the style. Fermented rice is quite present but much else is hard to pick up on.

Flavor is similar to the aroma. Better than most other Bud products though to be honest. More full than Bud light, and even regular Bud, but still very light. Somehow the fermentation is quite clean on the aroma which leads into a ricey then light biscuit malty and very sweet note similar to miller in the finish.

Feel is surprisingly nice here longer finish but it's all malt and slightly dry as opposed to being grossly mouthcoating. It goes away right as you get sick of it.

Overall for a Budweiser product, let alone Bud Light this is pretty good. Way better then Bud Ice and somehow stronger, even better than standard Bud, and still pretty clean. If you like Bud or Miller and want a higher ABV."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,3.16,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint plass. Light straw color, mild lacing. Aroma is mild grain husks. Mouthfeel: light and easy drinking. Flavor: malt sweetness (slightly cloying, but not horrendous), a hint of hops in the finish. Overall: not bad. I would drink a single, but not more than one as the sweetness begins to overwhelm."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.56,"haven't reviewed this yet. Poured into a shaker pint.

L: 2.75. a shade away from ginger ale. Head disappears quickly. Good carbonation despite the twist-off cap
S: 3. No hop character to speak of. Barely and rice.
T: 2. basically Malt liquor. Not a beer you want if you want something that tastes like a proper lager.
F: 3.25. With the higher ABV comes a harsher feel.
O: 2.75 Do not recommend"
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.52,"12 oz. poured into Pilnser glass, $2.09 at HEB

Aroma: Sweet corn forward, a little skunky
Taste: A little sweet, skunk taste on the back end
Mouthfeel: Flat, no carbonation
Overall: Disappointing, no head, the sweetness is cut by a poor finish. Pretty boring. I don't mind a big brewery offering but I do mind a bad offering. Not worth the money
Do not pair with foor, or even drink."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.72,"I wouldn't say it's awful but it's just a flat line. Not good, not bad. I don't know what they were trying for but they missed it. The only redeeming quality is the strength of it. It gives you a decent buzz."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.9,"They took bud light and somehow made it higher ABV while still being extremely watery. If Bud light is your go-to party beer, you'll like this one because less will do more."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.53,"Watch the head on this beer disappear faster than a trailer park prodigy skips out on his baby mamas child support. This is literally just a malt liquor in a pretty blue bottle. I mean don't get me wrong it has 50% less of a diesel taste than a Natty daddy or steel reserve, but it's still a high abv truck stop stud marketed as a club beer. If it's the same price as other 25 oz cans grab it, the buzz is nice and the sweet taste doesn't burn the tongue"
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.96,"This is a beautiful beer to sit down a get a nice buzz off of. As far as looks go, I drink out of the bottle and the bottle of this bad boy is a beautiful dark blue. This smells like your average American lager but I will say it has a bit more of a bold taste than your regular Miller or Coors Light. This is quite a grainy beer but a smooth and easy-to-drink one, nonetheless. Finally, the feel is one of the best for an American lager. With the 6% ABV, as I said, you get an incredible buzz off a few while barely noticing you are finishing them off!"
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,1.95,"I used to drink a lot more beer, for the effects, and sometimes I would drink this. Cheap, and enough alcohol that two 24oz cans will give you a decent buzz. I guess that would be the positive part of the review. I just tried it for the first time in a while. Bought a 24oz can. Poured into a beer stein. Watery yellow, with a large head that disappears almost immediately. It smells kind of like corn syrup and rubbing alcohol. The taste is like a hint of beer, and it's quite fizzy.

You know what? This is beer-flavored hard seltzer!"
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,3.47,"Bottle left at my house.
Brilliantly clear light gold in color with a huge bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. Sweet bready crackery light green apple sulfur and wet cardboard. Not horrible."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,3.1,I have to say that I was surprised at how decent this beer is. Is it awesome..no. But it is not bad at all. Nothing really special about the taste but it is quite drinkable. Not heavy at all considering the 6% ALC.
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,4.4,"Not super good, but it's drinkable. Very sweet going in, with a noticeable aftertaste that is even sweeter and kind of...off. Not a snob so I'll just say this. If i'm just wanting a few drinks of something that tastes good this will not be my go to. But if I am wanting to get beer drunk throughout an entire day, the 6% is very appealing with at least a tolerable flavor. 4/5 because its not the best flavor wise but hey, 6% is 50% more alcohol than 4%. It gets the job done if you want it to.
I guess to match the forum -
Look: ?? i just drink it? I dont care what it looks like
Smell: Beer. Just your standard cheap beer.
Taste: Sweet (for a beer). I hate sweetness and literally almost vomit after eating cake. But it doesnt taste like sugar like others have stated.
Feel: Like beer. Really, almost everything about this is pretty standard.
Overall: Guess that's what my first paragraph was about. If you're that worried just spend 14 bucks for a 12 pack and find out."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.48,"Look: Pours a very bubbly golden yellow color with a half finger white head.

Aroma: Red apple, tangy pear. Some minor sour green apple. Gentle breadyness.

Taste: Cereal, mostly corn flakes and cheerios. Some lightly toasted bread. It tastes more malty than regular bud light, with less off-metallic and sour flavors. Red apple and pear in the background, coming in only briefly after the initial breadyness fades out. Ends on a clean, but somewhat tiresome flavor of white sugar.

Feel: Sticky. Medium body, Medium carbonation. If this was less syrupy it'd be a lot better, the sugar really comes through on the mouthfeel to make it feel a lot heavier than it needs to be. Borderline unctuous.

Overall: This isn't bad, but it's very sugary. I don't know if I'd buy this over bud light, mostly because of the body. Part of the appeal of BL is being able to crush multiple cans back to back. The mouthfeel on this is just slightly too sticky and sugary to be sessionable, but to it's credit it does have a better flavor, it's just not as ""crisp"" or refreshing. This would pair well with food like burgers and hot dogs, or really anything off the grill in the summer, although on it's own it's a little overbearingly sweet."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,1.34,"I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence going in on this one. Good thing too. Poured from a 12 oz bottle:

Appearance isn’t bad. It pours a VERY light straw color with a bubbly white head that sticks around for a little while, at least around the circumference of the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Not exceptional but not bad.

Smell. Uh oh. The smell was mainly alcohol, maybe a bit of corn, but it was very faint indeed.

Taste... yikes. The bottle says “brewed for the night.” I hope no one ever has as bad of a night as they must have been having when this came to be. It’s a bit sweet right off the bat, but then turns to a watered down argument between booze, corn, and hops, and the booze wins. The beer leaves an almost metallic film on my tongue on the way down.

Feel - the carbonation is nice, and the body is obviously light, but I cannot get over the nasty film in my mouth. Thankfully the beer is chuggable so it can be over quickly and the 6% doesn’t feel like it’s there until later.

Overall - Bud Light is preferable to this in almost any scenario I can imagine. Not good.

*Note*
I had a second bottle, this time while eating Fritos, and that seemed to help with the metallic film. Didn’t make the beer better though, haha."
Worst,Bud Light Platinum,2.33,Oh man this one is rough. When i first saw it I thought it might be pretty good. Boy was I in for a surprise. I won't say its a bad beer but I have never had a beer that tastes less like a beer. Wasn't really sure what I was drinking. Overall not for me.
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,2.84,"2 years ago I was on the beach and at the bar there were serving this new drink for free!
So I wanted to give it a try.
The smell is quite nice I got to say, they tried to reproduce the flavour of the Iced Tea and I think the combination of it is quite nice on a hot summer day
Its a real refreshing beer very different that those lime beer. I got to tell u won t get drunk with that beer very easily.
Thats why I give a 3 because on a hot summer day drink 1 or 2 is definitely refreshing.
Even for women this beer might impressed u.
Would I recommend it. I will say yes. Its a changement from all those Lime Beer."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,1.96,"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, it smells like iced tea and sugary lemon. In the taste, just as you would think, it tastes like iced tea with a bunch of lemon juice poured in it. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a sweet lemon iced tea like aftertaste. I guess this is a beer, but more a malternitive. Sweet tea beer, I guess there is a market for it."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,2.64,"Last year it was lime, this year it would seem to be iced tea. Whatever, every beer deserves a chance.

Appearance: The pour produced a thin half finger of head that did not lace nor retain, so we aren't starting out well. Surprisingly a good amount of carbonation in the body, which looks like, well iced tea mixed with a light beer.

Smell: Unsurprisingly the smell of lemon iced tea dominates the nose. There's also a sugary note to it as well, with the barest touch of straw malt in the background. It's not bad, it's not especially good but it is as advertised.

Taste: I really want to try to analyze this beer but it, like the smell is as advertised. It tastes like Coors Light with some canned iced tea mixed into it. It works, just not very well as the malt takes away from the tea taste as it tries to struggle though, and the iced tea taste seems to mesh oddly with the carbonation. Still I've had worse.

Mouthfeel: Points get deducted for the complete lack of head. In this case here the carbonation seems to help bring out the iced tea taste, but instead of helping, it makes us realize why tea isn't meant to be carbonated. Nice mild iced tea aftertaste though, the beer seems to pull back the sweetness here.

Drinkability: Well, it's certainly refreshing but it's an odd beast to say the least. The high carbonation doesn't do it many favours, making it a bit gassy but it is easy enough going down. I don't know if I'd want more then a couple though.

Final Thoughts: I wouldn't regularly drink this, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The problem here is I'd probably be more charitable if I hadn't already had Mill St Lemon Tea Beer which is the right way of doing this. Maybe give it a shot, but don't buy a six pack."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,3.64,"Alright... so here it is. Coors Light Iced T, it's far from a beer. If you want to drink a BEER, stray far from this beverage. I really want to give this drink a fair review though, because it's really not that bad (as long as, again, you're in the mood for quaffing something other than a real beer).

Pours a colour slightly darker than the average macro, with a two finger head that quickly fizzles down to zero. No lacing, little cap.

Very sweet smell, dominant candy-like lemon scent, followed by tea, followed by the very faintest beer scent.

It doesn't taste much different than it smells. Sweet, candy lemon/iced tea with practically no malt or hops or anything that makes a beer a beer.

Soda pop like fizziness, very refreshing.

Call me crazy, but OVERALL, I like this drink. I wouldn't classify it as a beer by any means. It's like an iced tea cooler, only less sweet with no detectable alcohol flavours. If you gave it to a small child, they wouldn't know the difference between this and a carbonated iced tea soda pop concoction. It is incredibly refreshing. But I'll say it one last time, this is no beer. So beware. If you've ever wished for a soda that will get you buzzed, this is for you.

Cheers."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,1.36,"Picked up 6 of these by mistake, tried one, what swill,
the rest will probably be in the garage until Christmas,
then I'll give them to someone I don't like.
I don't know where they market tested this product
maybe a high school somewhere. Sorry Coors but
I think you made a mistake on this one, I doubt if it will be
around by next summer."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,1.23,"The acronym of this beer causes me far too much amusement, so I wanted to try it in order to pan it honestly. Overall it's as sweet as a soda, and may appeal to those who would prefer a 4% soda on a hot day...

Insipid golden colour yields no head and has very little visible carbonation, although mouthfeel not as bad as I expected. Sweet aroma solely of ice tea. Likewise no sign of malted barley or hops in the flavour, just a sweet ""pop"" like drink. Fascinating.

Long live the craft beer movement!!"
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,2.22,"Tallboy can from the LCBO. As an iced tea drinker, this at least looks like it might sort of be up my alley, certainly moreso than those stupid lime lagers that were all the craze a few years ago. Still, my expectations are... tempered, given the brewer.

Pours a translucent golden colour, a bit deeper than Coors Light but not much more attractive. The head looks rather promising at first - frothy and more than two fingers thick - but it fizzles away as quickly as any other macro light lager head, with absolutely no cap or lacing. The smell is ok - a bit lemony, but mostly just syrupy sweet Nestea-like flavour, with the actual beer-like aromas buried well beneath these overtones. Probably for the best.

The taste is tolerable, but rather muddled. The same sweet, syrupy commercial iced tea flavour from the aroma is here in force, with some slight lemon zest that provides a bit of (much appreciated) tartness. The aftertaste blends these flavours with the usual bland, diluted musty corn flavour of regular Coors Light. Light-bodied and watery, and very fizzy with its high carbonation, but something in the ingredients list gives it a slick, syrupy mouthfeel, which is definitely not an advantage for a light/adjunct lager. Drinkable, ideally served somewhere outdoors, with a high ambient temperature.

This definitely tastes more like iced tea than beer (not actual iced tea with tea leaves; just mass-produced Nestea/Brisk type stuff). I'm sort of on the fence here - I like this more than the regular Coors Light, but that's probably because it actually tastes like something besides fizzy water. Much like the regular stuff, this brew is clearly geared toward the palates of people who don't really like beer that much.

Final Grade: 2.2, a slightly-tolerable D grade. I really doubt this will take off like lime beers did, but I've been wrong before. For what it's worth, this is fairly refreshing, and far from the worst 'flavoured malt beverage' I've ever had. That being said, I doubt I'll ever buy this again. If I'm sitting on a hot patio, there are too many other brews I'd select first - a wit, a fruitbier, even a more orthodox pale lager or pilsener would be preferable over the deformed, cross-eyed chimera that is Coors Light Iced T."
Worst,Coors Light Iced T,4.59,Quite different than anything else out there. Being a Southerner I love some iced tea but didn't expect to like this. Turns out I love it. Smells better than most beer (sweetish) and tastes more like tea than it does beer. Will definitely be buying this again. Hopefully they keep it on the shelves and don't discontinue it.

If I remember correctly, the original strohs was one of the blandest beers to have ever crossed my lips long ago when I was still in college and actually had friends who were off getting engaged and crawling up their fiances ass to die until the inevitable divorce. Anyway, this joins the story as the last beer. Not sure it's even brewed anymore, but it's here and in front of me right now so it shall get a drinkin'.

Look - Crystal clear yellow with a big ass heavily frothy white head that splits like a wanna be gangsta dad finding out his one night stand is knocked up. Carbonation looks cripplingly high and painful. No lacing as the head didn't retain for long enough. 1.5.

Smell - Rice like adjuncts all over the place with a dosage of seltzer and mineral water. 1.5.

Taste - Prettttyyyy much the same. Rice adjuncts and seltzer water. 1.5.

Feel - Heavily carbonated with a very watery, nearly unbearable body. 1.5.

Overall - How can you take something like Strohs and make it even lighter..I really didn't see a difference between this and the original. Both painfully bland and not worth the cool labels on the can. 1.5."
Worst,Stroh's Light,1.91,"DEC09 2013 printed on the can, possibly a ""born on"" since Miller brews this.

Very pale dull canary yellow color, bright clarity and rapid carbonation.
Clumpy soapy foam with some dish soap lacing. Looks boring.

Smells like a musty old dishrag, just nasty.

Tastes better than that thankfully, some apple from the yeast, vague crackery malt. Dry aftertaste, thin and watery, bland. A real dumbed down lager, no structure or nuance at all, cheap buzz is all it is, at least it's not pretending.

As an aside, i've only spotted a couple old Strohs signs around town, but they're pretty cool actually, if you are into old breweriana."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,2.23,"This was another one bottle purchase. Good thing that I didn't get more. Terrible beer. I really had a hard time drinking this one as the taste reminded me of diluted beer, at least what I thought."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,1.9,"Um…horrible. Smell is faint beery. Taste, I’m thinking corn. I’m pretty sure this is a CORN beer. Not faint corn like some light beers, but serious corn. At least this really thin brew has some carbonation to it, a bright point. To think when I was growing up in the 80’s, this was a “Canadian Import” beer with a premium price. Ugh."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,2.99,"Yeah so Blue Light is like an old reliable friend. You really always know what you’re getting. A most crushable beer that is light, but doesn’t taste too watery or totally like chemicals. We have used Blue Light on many occasions, from horse races, graduation parties, beech excursions, that time at the Harp and post hockey game festivities. The beer we smoked in college has come with us on many a weekend since. Simply put, Blue Light far and away the best mass produced light beer you can buy."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,4,"Appearance: Pours completely clear, pale golden color with a nice white and foamy head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Nice pale malt aromas with a slight salty, bread and honey aroma. A hint of that pilsner malt comes through.

Flavor: Nice pale malts again with a slight bready sweetness from the pilsner malt. Really nicely showcases the malts here. Leans slightly sweet for the style.

Feel: Leans slightly heavier bodied. A small amount of residual sweetness on the tongue.

Compared to Trader Joe's Light Beer 6/13/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. Stronger and sweeter aromas. More bready and less dry and crackery. Overall sweeter with less carbonation. Winner: Labatt Blue

Overall: A nice and easy drinking light lager. Slightly heavier bodied for the style, but not really too heavily bodied but rather a nice malt sweetness. Nice pilsner malt flavors give it a pilsner flavor of slight bread sweetness. Really impressed by this light beer (Rating relative within style. Final Rating: 4.00)"
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,3.03,"355mL bottle, I am from Canada but I haven't had this in about 15 years. A thin white head caps a crystal clear pale golden beer. Mild aroma of sweet grain and grassy/spicy hops. Flavors are well balanced and very mild again with notes of biscuit, cereal grain, corn perhaps, bitterness is very modest while being earthy and a bit spicyb maybe grassy too. Light body, moderate carbonation, very easy drinking with a crisp finish. Again, a long time since I had this one. I will get it again if I see it, but it is not very common to see around here."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,4,"I live in California so this beer is pretty hard to find. Almost near impossible really. Anyways after having a few 6 packs, it's right in the sweet spot. It's not overly bitter or sour tasting at the end like Bud or Miller. Malt comes through clean, hops shine through lightly, and the beer finishes dry. It's a really enjoyable beer and a good overall light beer. I dont get the hate. You're reviewing a light beer, not an aged stout or an IPA. You're reviewing a light F'ing beer!"
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,3.8,"(24 oz can, code A29927, 'Let's Go Flyers' branding; purchased cold... poured into 28 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, gold liquid; tall build of explosive, crumbly white foam... keeps a collar but doesn't lace

S: mildly spicy apple peel overtone, subtle soapy-perfumy note; bit of a musty dough in the background... fair potency overall

T: good bit more slightly-sweetish cereal grain flavor than the smell lead on; the finish drops away, malt goes diluted, while that vaguely apple-y spicy (clove) phenol lingers... in subsequent sips, the spice fades and a dry, delicate, doughy malt rises and settles in... lovely dryness all the way through, just a bit too skewed toward the faint musty spice

F: light-bodied, softly foamy texture; silky wave rolling through... rather heavenly caress

O: comparing this to my review of regular Labatt Blue, I seem to prefer this lighter expression, assuming it's a similar recipe just scaled back... I've tried a relative crap-ton of light lagers lately, and this is one of the better ones (1465)"
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,3.54,"Labatt is another pretty mainstream beer that is served in most bars and carried in most places that sell cases of beer. Nothing wrong with it. One of those beers that I would definitely not sought after but would drink if it was the only thing around. Easy to drink a few while out on the golf course on a hot, sunny day."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light,2.89,"24 Oz Can poured into glass
Look - mainly clear pale yellow appearance as expected. Decent foam head and some glass lacing
Smell - aroma is lots of grains, i don't know if this has corn in it but it just has a general grains, a touch of hops.
Taste - tastes fresh, but has a stale aftertaste. It is obviously very drinkable and watery. There is a minimal amount of flavor, some mineral qualities maybe from the hops but absolutely no bitterness, not too sweet either. It just sort of goes down the hatch. Nothing to really pick up in terms of flavor. Carbonation is high.

Overall, a very light beer that lacks flavor. It's not bad if you just want something to pound but there are better options..

Smell - Not much of anything, just a slight corny sweetness.

Taste - Buttery shortbread cookies and refreshing malt flavor. No off-putting bitterness and surprisingly little alcohol taste for the high ABV. An easy drinker.

Feel - Smooth and silky. Just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down good.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish. Overall, ok malt liquor. The diacetyl is not overpowering and awful here. Also not the cleanest example and not one I would purchase again."

Poured into a frosty mug out of a 40 oz bottle. Because... you can't get a good proper aroma in the 40. Sue me.
Anyhow.
Aroma: wonderful, malty, hint of movie popcorn with butter. Is that really that bad when there are beers out now intended on tasting like peanut butter or smelling like grapefruit? No. Not at all. Cry about it!
Appearance: Wonderful head, like my ex gave before she wrecked my life and married some other guy in 4 months. In all seriousness, beautiful appearance in a mug. Looks like a macro beer in an advertisement. Darker color than most AALs. Instagram worthy.
Taste: Ice cold? Smooth, crisp, hides the potency of the girthy liquid quite well. Warmed up a bit? Good. Yes. Good. Don't be a stereotypical snob. There are floral notes here, along with some hoppy characteristics. Tastes like it would cost you 3 times more with some crazy label touting independence from the big bad macro evil guys. Because it is hip to be square. Right?
Buzz: You need a buzz rating. If you don't do one, you're lying to yourself... if you consumed a beer of high ABV and posted a review on some godforsaken website. Like I did! 10/10. Increases luck with the ladies, much added confidence. Hey, it's how I met my ex mentioned earlier, one St Ides and I was in 3 hour sex romps and meeting a totally dysfunctional family from the seventh layer of hell before I knew it! Don't take my word for it. Get you a 40 oz of St Ides today, before Pabst kills off this legacy brand to help fight ""racism"" or some such trite shit. It is good. And it gets you feeling like you discovered liquid weed. Also helps you deal with an insane sociopath destroying your life with her delusions! Incredible brew."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.59,"Pours a clear, dark yellow with minimal head that dissipated quickly, high carbonation. The smell is very malty, sweet aroma. The taste is malt forward as expected, caramel sweetness, some graininess, and a surprising slight hop bitterness, also boozy as the alcohol comes through with this one. Mouthfeel is crisp, easy drinkability, with a slight boozy warmness. Overall, dead on for the style of a malt liquor/strong lager. There is no pretense with this beer, it is exactly what you would expect."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.66,"40 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 4/6/2020. Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a nice malt liquor. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and pretty refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very clean and nicely rich pils malt/grain showcase, with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not too overwhelming on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and impressive style example as expected of Pabst."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.1,"Purchased at some crummy gas station next to where my friend works. Drank straight from the 40.

This is pretty harsh stuff for the first few sips. It has a pronounced alcohol taste and it's pretty heavily carbonated compared to some of the other 40s I've tried."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.12,"24 oz. can:

Pours golden with a white head that slowly dissipates, leaving little lacing.

The smell is of some fruity alcohol, some grain, some booze.

The taste is of booze with a general sweetness. It has a bland, hot finish.

It is rather harsh with some a hint of malty smoothness. Not too fizzy.

It's a cheap, hot malt liquor. It is what it is. Below average for the style."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.69,"A: The beer is crystal clear deep golden yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with just a few specks of bubbles on the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light to moderate aromas of corn adjuncts are present in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell and has flavors of corn and rice adjuncts, but these aren't as pronounced compared to adjunct lagers. A faint amount of bitterness is perceptible, and the hops mostly serve to cancel out the sweetness that you might expect in the taste.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and a little dry on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: Although the smell and taste of this beer are a little bland, there's nothing really offensive about them and the alcohol is well masked from the taste.

Serving type: bottle"
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,1.17,"24 fl oz aluminum can acquired at a bodega in Brooklyn for $0.92.

8.20% ABV.

Yeah, that's pretty bad stuff. Syrupy thick, with a sticky adhesive mouthfeel that makes it rather off-putting when coupled with the high sweetness and corn adjunct-emphatic flavour profile. Ugh. I guess if we're searching for the good in it, there's some decent generic floral hop character.

Boozy, though not as egregiously so as the worst malt liquors. Difficult to drink in any case. This is definitely one to steer clear of, even within the budget high ABV category. Not the worst ""student beer"" I've tried, but one can definitely imagine this wouldn't taste all that different coming up.

F / AVOID

***
03/14/17: Runs $3.50 per 40oz clear glass bottle elsewhere in Brooklyn. Happened to nab one since nothing else affordable for a friend's party was available.

Syrupy malty garbage best left for homeless men who might need its hefty bottle to double as a weapon, St. Ides is swill unfit for anyone outside the student demographic, but I suppose it's worth noting that it isn't metallic or buttery...it's severely problematic, but flavour-wise there isn't anything egregiously way off. There's worse out there, but this is just downright bad.

D- / AVOID

***
05/17/17: It prompts one towards self-reflection when one finds oneself experiencing this beer for a third time. (Budget was again a concern whilst attending an event, and it was essentially this or a direly overpriced 6 pack of expired Magic Hat).

Cloying syrupy rotgut. The kind of beverage that would pair well with dumpster fire roasted rat and an improvised cardboard mattress pad. I imagine one day sociologists will link availability of this swill with antisocial behaviour amongst perpetually itinerant populations.

I should have left this on the shelf for the recidivists. Straight up abysmal.

F / AVOID"
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,3.61,"This was a pretty good malt liquor. Drank out of the bottle, it had a very light yellowish brown color with a large head that receded quickly. Smells of corn and grain with a little bit of a honey sweetness. The taste is pretty decent with a a sweet corn taste with a very light honey aftertaste. It is well carbonated and it goes down smooth with a good alcoholic taste."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,1.5,"Mostly yellow beer, substantial clarity. Aroma was rough industrial canned veggie and rubbing alcohol.

Lots of corn and cough syrup feels, cleaning products, fire alcohol water mouthfeel. Hella carbonated. Massive alcohol burn on this one. Not for the faint at heart."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.7,"St. Ides.

Friend from my younger years stopped by recently and we sat around smoking copious amounts of marijuana and he added malt liquor into the equation for himself. For whatever reason, he decided it would be funny to leave Ken behind for me. And since I leave no stone unturned and no straggler undrank I figured why the hell not.

Look - From the Twenty-Four ounce can hard poured into some random glass from my kitchen. This brew pours a see through yellow with clarity beyond clarity along side a monster frothy white head that takes up most of the glass. This beer demands multiple pours. Carbonation is higher than astronaut pussy. No lacing nor stick amongst a finished glass.

Smell - It really isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Has all the typical malt liquor processed sugar and corn but the alcohol somehow manages to keep itself tame and it doesn't make me want to vomit in my mouth already from your moms spaghetti based on the smell. Now the real chore...let's see how it tastes...* takes sip *

Taste - Again, it is really dominated by the corn and cheap mass amounts of sugars. It's like an ultra alcoholic version of the malt liquor Magnum that I remember drinking when I was 18 while partying with some less than desirable women in Toledo, Ohio just off of West Alexis road. Didn't catch anything luckily.

Feel - Super thing bodied with a killer amount of carbonation to block out the flavors which is what I've come to expect with this style. Alcogol finally shows up but it isn't that bad. Swallows rather easily.

Overall - As far as a .79 can of malt liquor goes this wasn't so bad. Not going to win any gold medals obviously but it is drinkable. Likely going to feel this one tomorrow. Oh well, reminded me if being a teenager long ago in a land far, far away. Take it for what you will."
Worst,St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,2.62,Sometimes you just gotta summon your inner Eazy-E and drink a 40oz of the St. Ides. It's not as bad as it's made out to be but then again I do have a soft spot for malt liquor so I may be biased.
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,"pours a fine looking beer. actually raiting this based off the 40 oz i opened a few weeks back, poured one pint of and twisted the cap back on. worth nothing its glass 40 oz. honestly i went to pour it out, and heard a nice big hiss, saw the beer do some fuckin' science in the glass, so i poured the thing in my glass. turned out to be a good move, its a solid unpretentious american hellesbock. head stayed on like a miller beer would. tastes like a pabst extra. rated to style."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.3,"This was a beer reminding me of my high school days and nights of drinking beers when we could get them. Nice to see that it is still around.
Poured a golden color with a fairly thick white head and very bubbly. The smell was malt, corn, bread and hops. The taste was malt, bread, and hops."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.59,"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a bite head. Smell is corn ,malt wheat and hay. Taste follows nose some citrus hops ,cracker meal malt grassy herbal note . Mouth feel is not boozy has a sweetness to it, could drink another for sure."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.17,"From a 24oz can:

Appearance: Clear yellow-gold, huge head.

Smell: Sweet corn, some stale hay.

Taste: Sweet, slight corn, sweet fruitiness-slight pear note. Medium to light body, sweetness lingers somewhat in the finish.

Overall: What better than some malt liquor over the 4th of July weekend? Finally trying the legendary Colt 45 as one of the local stores had it in 24oz cans. Not too bad, as with most in the style you want to drink it cold. No major flaws, a solid malt liquor that's up there with OE800 and Mickey's as good ones in the style."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.26,"Got a 24oz can best by August 1st poured into my warsteiner pils glass just for fun.

On the pour a 1ish finger head forms then becomes fizzy amd recedes to a ring around the glass amd light covering. Crystal clear generic lager color, a light straw gold, with lively carbonation. Looks like a decent cheap beer. And it almost wants to lace

The nose is surprisingly decent especially for the style. Some slight green apple off notes right up front, but not too far behind is an actual bready malt aroma that is present, possibly even some cheap but detectable hops on the nose. There is a bit of oxidized notes but this is way better than Olde English 800 for sure. As it warms the green apple flavor grows and becomes almost unpleasant but it's really just a cheap lager note that I get a lot in AAL beers a lot more than I'm getting in this one.

Flavor follows the aroma bringing a bit of corniness along with the malts. The hops largely disappear leaving only a hint of bitterness right up front that mingles with a bit of the green apple, then gives way to a largely pleasant and almost soft bready and corny malt/grain flavor. Coming in with low expectations I was very pleasantly surprised.

Feel is at first sip a bit watery with a quick finish and a big hit of carbonation bite, but as you drink more it hits the stomach quite heavily making this quite filling, which is a bit of a curve ball after everything else about this beer made me forget that technically this is a malt liquor. No complaints really however as this is the only spot that has even been close to reminding me what kind of beer I'm drinking.

Overall I've had beers that where a whole lot worse than this. Obviously I've had better but this is almost a decent American style lager. And at only 5.6% it's really not all that big a beer by today's standards. The only thing really making this a malt liquor is that it's been around since the only choices were bud miller and coors and it's a bit stronger than those BMC beers. Taste is actually surprisingly high quality for what it is."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2,Use only in extreme emergencies if you are a poor high school kid. Almost enough nostalgia to make me want to revisit in the current age and see what it's all about. The keyword being almost haha. Who knows?
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.39,"24oz can

Poured this out bc I'm a maniac big lenny style, and it's beautiful, big lenny style. Smells like corn, hops, and rot. Taste is heavy on that spoiled ""garbage juice"" flavor that I guess some people are keen on... it gets ya drunk"
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.23,"Pours a clear straw color with two fingers of lightly yellowed head that don’t last too long, but leave great lacing.

Corn, burnt toast and a hint of hops in the nose.

It’s sweet up front, but has considerably less of the green apple of other popular examples. A kiss of diacetyl extends into the otherwise dry, slightly toasty finish.

Highly fizzy mouthfeel — maybe a touch too fizzy.

This isn’t awful, but I prefer others in the style."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,1.18,"I mean the beer looks fine but everything else about this beer is abysmal. Don't ever buy this nasty beer. The smell made me gag, it burned on the way down, I don't even like Bud light and I will get that over Colt 45 anyday"
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.24,"24oz can, best by date NOV2221. Poured into an Arcoroc nonic pint glass.

A - pours golden yellow with a foamy head that leaves some lacing on the glass as it recedes. Poor head retention.

S - smells primarily of grain and adjuncts. As it warms there's a slight funk that becomes more noticeable.

T - Sweet malts and grains up front with a slight, tangy fruitiness on the finish which threw me off a bit. There's a boozy warmth that takes hold in my chest despite the lower ABV.

M - Thin-bodied with high carbonation; almost watery in its consistency.

O - Drinkable but disappointing. Would go back to this only if better brews weren't available. Tick completed."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.53,"Colt 45 is the same pale straw color as any other lager I’ve ever had. CO2 supports a rocky white head that practically melts into nonexistence as I type this.

Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is cooked corn. Coming in at 8% abv, it’s no wonder the next aroma I pick up resembles rocket fuel. Corn and rocket fuel are supported/accentuated by up front aroma of soda cracker and pale, grainy malt. Everything else is pretty straightforward, leading into an aroma that has barely any detectable hop presence at all.

On the tongue, Colt 45 is kind of smooth but has an oddly slick mouthfeel to it. Flavors of cooked corn start things off before moving into an almost astringent graininess. Then, the center comes along with its high octane booziness. Colt 45’s flavors are an almost barren wasteland of dryness as they move through the center to a finish that only gets some of its roundness back. Too bad, there’s not an ounce of real refreshment anywhere in this beer.

There are no redeeming qualities to this malt lager no matter how hard I look. It’s alcoholic, boozy in a bad way, and not well balanced at all. Its only redeeming quality is that it’s cheap and strong"
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.04,"Somewhat surprised that this was the first time I've had it. As a younger man, it was almost a game to try as many economy beers as possible.

Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. Straw yellow, astonishingly clear, decent sticky head retention. Generic beer sent. Sweetness makes it highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is watery. I'd much prefer this to a core Bud or Miller product."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,3.18,Setting the stage as a Malt Liqour. Look: appearance is a straw yellow. The smell is hard to place like a harder alcohol bud heavy. Taste: Taste actually really good compared to other types of alcohol in its category.
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,4.82,"This beer goes down better than fine and makes me feel great! I would've given higher than a 5 for Feel but that's the highest choice available. It really does ""work every time"" (...except for beer snobs)

10 out of 5"
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,1.33,"While this beer really isn't bad tasting for the percentage, it'll straight up put you to sleep. I drank 1 can and all I wanted to do is have a nap.
Not all alcohol is created equal, and this is terrible. The single worst beer I've ever had as far as the buzz goes. Will never buy this again."
Worst,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,2.49,"Economics compelled me, so why not review it? It pours almost flat with some mild carbonation. I can read my aspirin bottle through it. It does smell like a beer. The taste is mostly sugary, but not sickeningly sweet. There's no character, so nothing to feel going down. I thank the beer gods that the check was in today's mail."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.75,"June 2007: 500 ml can, supplied by my friend Olav. Brewed by ""Dutch Export Breweries"". ABV was 11.6%. Golden colour, moderate head. Weak aroma, a hint of white wine and honey. Very sweet and alcoholic flavour. Pretty bad."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.43,"Managed to get to the review box without seeing previous ones...yesss..! It's difficult.

Left out the fridge for 30 minutes before drinking.

Initial impressions, I do not like the green can much. For me green is not beer. It's the devil or maybe wheatgrass juice or broccoli.

For a strong beer at 11.6%, it is very light. Basically like a lager, with a bit more colour. Head goes down fast.

Aroma has no fruitiness, nothing complex...just fizziness and a hint of sawdust.

Not looking forward much to the taste...

Taste is intense, spirit like. Much better than a lager like Carlsberg or Heineken, as at least there is taste. Though the taste is alcohol, almost vodka, and not a complex brewed taste with lots of flavour, This is obviously made for the alcohol, not the taste. The perfect beer for someone who hates their life, wants to get drunk, forget things, and who wants to save money as much as possible.

Would I drink if I was homeless..? For sure. There is fuck all else to do and I probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of Chimnay Bleu.

The taste has elements of honey, lots of sweetness (surprising for such a strong beer).

It's my opinion that the ingredients are false. They have basically mixed beer with pure alcohol and sugar. Therefore alcohol should be on the ingredients. Perhaps they do not have to add this as a seperate one...haha clever.

This has not been brewed, it has been mixed.

Still, it's better than a mass produced lager. Though, really it is the same, just mixed with alcohol. So it gets a pretty low rating from me..."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,2.51,"My, that’s some alcohol burn you got there....very malty lager with lots of heat. Looks good though, with nice thick creamy head. But then again you’re not drinking this for taste, you want a buzz...and you’ll get it."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.42,"Truly horrible. Bought as a curiosity from a French supermarket shelf.

""Trampagne"" at it's most cynical maximum alcoholic units per buck formula

Curiously syrupy when overchilled (freezer incident)

Avoid"
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,2.95,"This one should just fall into the malt liquor category. Picked this up from a small store in Paris for a good, cheap buzz before heading out. It's got a very strong malty, bready flavor, and a lit of heat from the alcohol as it warmed. Not gonna lie, I was expecting a lot worse after seeing the score on ba, but hey, I didn't mind it. Tastes much better out of a can.. Not worthy of a bock glass."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,2.06,"Another can brought back from the South of France in Sep 13: this 500ml monster was cracked open on 2 Dec 13, well before it's expiry date.

Poured (twice) into a La Chouffe tulip at home.

Bright, light golden/amber with a deep head on each pour, the heads tried to hang around for a while too.

A hangover in a single can: smells grainy, tinny and alcoholic, tastes grainy, tinny and alcoholic, palate wise I thought it, grainy, tinny and alcoholic, overall it was grainy, tinny and alcoholic.

It actually got a little better as it warmed and my second glass was almost pleasant,well almost."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.45,"Got this one in Normandy at a grocery store. This one is Max Intense! Described as a ""beer rich in ingredients"" with a ""long brewing process.""

From a 50cl can into a pint glass

APPEARANCE: Pours a three finger, loose looking, white head with decent retention. Really loose and chunky looking. Perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation. Force carbonated. Fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy, chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. Splotchy wisp leaves some foamy lacing down the glass.

SMELL: Bread and grainy malts, corn, and some alcohol.

TASTE: Rough going. Boozy and sweet grain up front, with sweet bread and corn into the finish. A bolder finish is boozy with alcohol, corn and sweet grainy malts. Not pleasant in the least. Harsh.

PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A little light, goes down airy and bubbly with a harsh burn at swallow and finishes slightly sweet on palate. Some alcohol lingers.

OVERALL: Not a doppelbock at all. This is simply a strong Euro pale lager, and a really strong one at that. I guess it's better than malt liquor, but the only reason one would even consider drinking this would be to get mashed on the cheap. I can't believe a brewer would taste this and go, ""yes, this is exactly what I wanted..."""
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,2.33,"A crystal pale beer with a white foam that rapidly disappear,no lace at all.
Aroma is somehow fruity,boozy and a bit yeasty.Its taste resembles dry fruits, alcohol and subtle malt hints are present.Bitterness is balanced and carbonation could be a little less prominent.Medium bodied"
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.14,"Originally bought a can of this in Singapore at a convenience kiosk. I bought it because it was cheap, strong, and I like to try new beers. It is the best prank beer I have ever had... By this i mean that every time I went out in town with a different one of my shipmates, I told them about this ""heavenly"" beer that they must try because it is without a doubt the best drinking experience they will ever have. I was of course lying to them, which brings me to my review:

Pour: Left it in the can for fear of Singapore's strict environmental laws.

Aroma: Alcohol and sawdust.

Taste: Alcohol, fermented sugar, corn-nuts, and a hint of earwax in the finish.

Mouth/face: Twisted in disgust (This reaction is what kept me exposing poor individuals to this particular brew, and I would often take pictures of my victims during this phase of tasting).

Overall: Good for pulling a fast one on one of your buddies, even if it means you have to suck it up and down one with them (My version of keeping it fair). Consume only for getting drunk or preparing your taste buds for eating handfuls of Thai chilies."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.99,"We pour a clean, goldenrod colored brew. It holds a one finger head of tan bubbles, but this disappears on the quicker side, leaving a thick sheet of patterned lacing. Carbonation is active, and there is a mild haze throughout. The aroma is bold, with wheaty and pale malts. There is a stark tropical fruit quality, with passion fruit and pineapple right up front, with some strawberries to boot. This adds a unique sweetness. There is a menthol, minty quality, with surprisingly raw, piney hops. The alcohol is ever present, especially with warmth. As we sip, holy crap. It is like drinking a fruity nail polish remover. The front is dominated by insane metallics, mixing with lightly buttered toast, and those interesting fruity notes from the nose. There is distinct pineapple here, with an added dipped-in-sugar sweetness. The middle moves forward with offensive fusel alcohols, fermented apples, and bittering metallic malts. The finish shows more vodka alcohols and copper, tinny metallics. There is honey sweetness, and more of those strawberries. The aftertaste is burning with booze, fresh cherries, more bitters, and surprisingly pale malts. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. The mouth is left dry, but with an initial metallic film. There is okay cream and froth, but little slurp or pop with each sip. Due to the high alcohol presence it is very puckering. The abv is huge, and the beer drinks very slowly.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the nose. It had great fruity inclusions that were not expected, making for a sweet and inviting aroma. When we sipped, however, we were horribly disappointed. Each sip was like taking a shot of cheap, Canadian beer-flavored vodka. It was extraordinarily hard to drink. The feel was decent, but otherwise, this was a miss for us, with little appeal other than the nose."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.97,"Look: Pours an golden-yellow colour with a large head, leaving a nice lacing.

Overall: Don’t drink this"
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.81,"500ml bottle poured in a chalice.

After the Explorator(D+) and the Navigator(D+) drinking this one is, at least, a big mistake.

T: Bad surprise. Tastes like liquor. Very sweet upfront. A bit fruity. Reasonable bitterness (the ONLY good point of this beer)
M: Heavy and molasses body. Reasonable carbonation to such strong beer
D: Really bad..."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.39,"Gotta say this is quite possibly the worst beer I've ever had, and I've had some pretty bad ones as of late.
Had this in Paris, got it as a joke, didn't end up finishing it. Managed to trick one of my friends into taking a sip though -- that was good for a laugh.

A: Doesn't look much worse than other Strong Euro Lagers, dark yellowish color...not too appealing.

S: Smell is repulsive. Honestly the homeless people I've seen drinking this crap could've pissed back into the can and barely told a difference.

T: Taste is miserable at best, downright offensive at worst. It has nothing going for it in terms of an actual beer...tastes more like a cough syrup.

M: This has a very thick, syrupy texture to it. Not a heavy mouthfeel, but a labored mouthfeel, like sludge.

D: Great for novelty or a gag, but your sink will likely drink most of this one...poor sink."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.82,"I bought this in Holland on a recent trip. It pours a golden light orange with a nice looking head that lingers beautifully. The aroma isn't offensive, some sweet graininess, maybe some cooked corn. The flavor isn't bad at first, upfront it tastes like a flavorful macro lager. The flavor quickly gives way to sharp, boozy alcohol, sweet and syrupy, and not smooth at all. This one is hard to put down, and I can't find much redeeming value."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1.24,"A-C'mon, it might be horrible, but it looks as good as most other beers. Pours a light golden color w/decent head and retention, bits of lacing.

S-Smell actually doesn't reveal all the problems while it's still cold, which mine is. Grainy husk, alcohol, slightly sweet malt, bits of corn, some skunkiness.

T-This stuff tastes like my mouth after I used to wake up from college benders when I forgot to brush my teeth. Alcohol, slightly sweet grainy flavor, cheap hooch, aftertaste of nail polish remover and a touch of hops.

M-My mouth feels really bad. I feel remorseful. Maybe recycling the can will make me feel better.

D-First beer I haven't finished in a long while. This stuff is repulsive. If you want to drink something this strong, just go for a bottle of wine. In France you can get a potable bottle for just double the price of this poison. Other strong Euro beers, and any American malt liquor I can imagine are far superior...that includes King Cobra, Camo, and Steel Reserve."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,1,"Desperation drove myself and a Danish electrician to try cans of this crap in a shipyard in Dubai. That and a dare. Oh good lord, is this stuff foul. I should have known better when we popped the tabs and took a whiff. We have paint thinner on our vessel that is more palatable. We looked at each other and knew it wasn't getting any better, so, with a toast to our comrades, away we went. One gulp into this unholy abomination was all it took. I'm not going to dignify this beer with talking about mouthfeel, or lacing, or hop profiles, or what have you. It was pure evil in a can. Like Satan's own urine... the taste was something akin to beer spilled into mop water, with a healthy dose of rubbing alcohol thrown in. I can't call it a drain pour, well, because I couldn't find a drain. I hate to admit it, but we gave our unfinished cans to a Nepalese cook that was with us... poor bastard. I'm sure karma will get us back one day for that one. Avoid this ""beer"" at all costs."

D- Drank one and that was enough. Had no desire to drink another nor do I have any desire to buy another anytime soon."
Worst,Amsterdam Maximator,2.93,"I'd heard about this beer long before I drank it. Found it in a corner store / kiosk / bodega in Geneva, Switzerland for about 3 Swiss Francs. Bought it along with several ""normal"" beers to sample. Started out pretty smooth because it was still cold but the further I got into it, the more pronounced was the taste of the alcohol. It was however, compared to it's weaker brother Amsterdam Navigator (8,4%) surprisingly smooth. A definite must if you're looking for a good bang/buck ratio."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,5,"I've finished three 18 packs and a 12 pack of this 'MGD' beer in the past month, so I think it's time I tell you how I feel about it. It's incredible, the smoothest beer I can find at the moment. About a dollar per beer, it's affordable. Big foamy white head every time, the feel of it going down is almost like the addictive bite of soda pop. The new redesign was apparently done to attract younger customers and at age 29, I can tell you it worked on me, I love the new black and red logo. Not too strong, never left me hungover, overall just the perfect domestic brewskie in my complete and 100% honest opinion."

Smells of dried wheat, matured noble hops and fresh stirred bread dough.

Mouthfeel of this is light, well carbonated and quite refreshing with a pleasant softness to it.

Tastes of caramel accompanied wheat and white bread rind, together with a well nuanced initial hop dryness, getting wrapped up by more pronounced toffee later on. Offers a creamy graininess then, with a faint herbal undertone to it and more caramel wheat. Finishes with a great softness, crackers and a rock sugar highlighted maltiness.

This is quite interesting as far as its creamy mouthfeel goes, while the beer offers a simplistic, well working flavor approach with well pronounced malts and lighter, nuancing hops."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,2.18,"This used to be my jam, when it first came out in 86, but I haven't had this since 87 or 88 until today.
10 bucks for a 12 pack, alright! Golden corn-enhanced(yuk) clear body, nice head and lacing if you pour into a glass. Very little aroma, and very little flavor. Just a mild sweet cornflake note, slight winey tartness from yeast/hop, and it's gone in a flash. Best enjoyed at 33-39 F on a hot day. Good for a cheap near-buzz and trip down memory lane, otherwise - nah. It will be another 35 years or more before I buy this again. Corn swill."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3.79,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light, vibrant golden color with a moderate and clean white head. SRM of 6. (4.00)

Aroma: Mild aromas of pale malts, adjuncts, corn, some yeast before more corn adjuncts linger on the finish.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts, corn adjuncts. Strong yeast in the middle before the corn adjuncts follow through to the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation, to finish clean and dry. Slightly astringent from the yeast and corn.

Compared to Budweiser 5/10/22: Pours a similar, slightly lighter color. Stronger aromas. More corn adjuncts. Less pale cracker malts and bread. More astringent on the finish.

Overall: Drinks pretty much how I would expect a Miller Draft to drink. Similar to their Miller light but with a stronger malt body. Has the same corn adjunct flavors and strong carbonation here for finish slightly astrigent. Packs a bigger punch than others within the style. Drinks very nice here. (Rating within the style: 3.79)"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3.14,"Fresh Can Edited review

Unfortunately just drinking it out of the can so no look update but I'm sure it's still good these are gushers when you crack em

Smell is not disgusting this time. Not fantastic but an actually passing grade. The average American lager smell with a nice dose of sweet malt behind it. Still some skunk and in the can a bit Metallic as well, but nowhere near as bad as an old bottle of this stuff damned clear bottles.

Taste is essentially a malt bomb but still crisp with most of the sweetness showing up in the aftertaste. Slight bitterness that goes away as you drink but no hop character. Very bready but smooth.

Feel is actually quite nice not the best part of the beer anymore but it's more impressive than I made it out to be in my other review. Head makes it creamy, but co2 bite isn't a big part of this beer the head just takes over.

Overall better than the beer I got a while ago the can protects it pretty well and it tastes like it's pretty fresh too. It's a malty sweet refreshing treat that's easy to put down and cheap. Tastes pretty good too when it hasn't gone bad.


~~~~~~~~~~OLD REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~
Poured from a presumably old clear 12oz bottle into a pint glass.

The look is an average adjunct with a surprisingly good head going for it and lively carbonation. A golden straw color with no haze. Somehow the head that sticks around for the whole drink and actually forms a lot of lacing here.

Smell is bad. Very UV struck and skunky as fuck pardon my french. So skunked it's almost like dog shit it's bad. I dont know how old it is, but jeez. They need to start putting this in brown bottles cause around here it seems like it sits. Just lager skunk and a bit of shit.

If I dont breathe through my nose it's much better than the smell and actually drinkable maybe even better than a bud. I'm sure if somehow I got a better bottle it would be better but I'm not sure if that's possible around here so the smell score stays, but the taste is actually quite nice. A sweet malty lager. No hop really to speak of, that probably all got destroyed by the stupid branding desicion to put a slow mover in a clear bottle.
Malt is actually malty and if I couldnt smell my breath I'd call it drinkable, until I catch a whiff of my breath.

Feel is dead average for the style. Not watery, but not dense or think in any strech of the imagination. Definitely one of the better parts of this beer, other than all that lacing, like damn.

Overall I'm sure this has more potential than the bottle I got, but this was rough. The smell of skunk almost made this a bottle pour. At least this actually has lacing."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3.57,"MGD, high life, lite. all these beers look fantastic poured out. You can't get the same looking beer from any other macro that the miller line has, very german like frothy head you'd also find in other euro beers. This is the best of the adjuncts imo, wish they didn't change to the stupid red circle eagle looking logo's, the other logo's fit in with the line. But, maybe that's the point. But this logo just sucks big time. Great beer though. Put it in the high life bottles though, if possible. Please."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,2.03,"Pours a clear pissy yellow with a small head that was gone in a flash, surprisingly it left so lacing on the glass. Aroma of corn, cracker and mild hops. Taste is corn and grain, thin bodied, lotsa carbonation. This was something I drank back iin the day. Most will be used for brats."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3.14,"Bought this beer because I was looking for something cheap and refreshing on a hot day. Pounded the first one straight from the bottle and felt nothing. Thought I'd look to see how much alcohol was in this stuff and landed here. Poured my second into the closest thing i have to a pilsner glass and began my review. I got a thick head over an inch which lasted about 2 minutes. Color is pale with a lively effervescence and very clear. This beer looks great. Disappearing head left a nice lacing of froth on the sides of my glass. Not much smell. Maybe a little metallic with a slight earthy aroma. Definitely has a metallic aftertaste with a little bit of bitter. Not much taste at all while its going down. This is not a very exciting beer and you'll have to drink it very quickly if you want a buzz from it. This is a good beer to enjoy cold with some BBQ and friends before undertaking some sort of summertime activity that requires you to not be overly sedated. I don't recommend drinking more than 2 per sitting. Afterwards go do something to work off that 144 calories per bottle. On sale for 18 bucks for 20, I'd just as soon drink PBR which is a little less expensive and probably a little more flavorful. Still, I think this beer deserves better than it seems to get around here. It has it's time and place. I'm glad we drank this stuff as teenagers because if we had stronger beers like are common now, we might not have survived."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,2.85,"had this beer from the USA when I was younger 25 years ago.
I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario they now brew it here in Canada by Molson Coors just like the Coors banquet they call it Coors original now here in Canada .
473ml at 4.7%.
poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared. but left a lace as I was drinking it
again they brew it better in The USA not a fan of this MGD beer in Canada a little better in The USA i think
overall another crap beer from Molson Coors trying to copy the original MGD from the USA. would have gave the original MGD from the USA a 3.08
cheers"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3.54,"Macrobrews don't come by this way often, but when it does it's usually MGD. Say what you will, but I find it easy to drink (out of a bottle... no cans, here) and reminiscent of rural weddings where - while they did have champagne - this champagne of beers was probably almost as good, and it went with everything there as it does on a hot Wisconsin day. Maybe it is nostalgia, but this slightly honey-colored brew that smells of little and has just a bit of effervescence is a simple beer for a simple man."
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,1.25,"(January 2005). Seriously struck by rating addiction, I bought this beer only to rate it - and I hate myself for it! Hate hate hate!! I paid good money for this crap, in the US at least it’s cheap - here it’s expensive. Importing this shit to Europe is totally ridiculous! And the alternative in Norway, if you want an American beer, is Bud!! (If you’re ’lucky’, you might find Michelob!) My expectations were very low, but I soon found out that this ’beer’ was even worse than I expected. Aroma reminiscent of the wine yeast of my disastrous, short lived wine-making career 15 years ago. Excessive head that disappears rather quickly. Hardly any flavour at all - just a bland, metallic mouthfeel. Luckily, there is no aftertaste either (if there was, it would surely have been bad). ’Genuine draught’ my ass! This is just bad, real BAD!!"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,2.77,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a can Into a pint glass.
Looks clear golden yellow with a rocky foamy head that dropped quickly to zero.
Smells of corn, malt, lightly floral.
Taste follows the nose nicely, I taste a lot of corn and sweetness.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall good at cookout on a hot day when someone hands you a free one.
Cheers!"
Worst,Miller Genuine Draft,3,"Straight outta the gate, I'm not a big fan of Miller products, finding the majority of them too light and smacking of adjuncts.
I purchased MGD for the first time because I'd be drinking a few with some BBQ and simply wanted something lighter and frankly, cheap.

Surprisingly, MGD wasn't bad. Nice ""beery"" yellow-gold. Head lasted down to the bottom of the glass!
Light malt nose with light grassy hops peeping through. Taste exactly like the nose, only with a mild corn aftertaste.
I'm still not a Miller fan, but being as neutral as possible for this review, this was a pretty decent beer."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,2.9,"First off, I am not a fan of light beers. But this doesn’t really taste like other light beers. True, it doesn’t have much color or body, but compared to every other “light” beer I have sampled, this beer hits it out of the park. It actually has some flavor. I have not tasted anything close to this that has only 64 calories. Plus, it only has 2.3% alcohol, perfect for hot summer days when you want to drink more than a few beers and still stay relatively sober. Given the low calorie and alcohol content, this is a superior product.

I think most reviewers are being somewhat unfair with their reviews. If you lined up 10 other light beers along with this beer in a taste test, this beer would stand alone as real beer flavor. True, if you did the same comparison with 10 other non-light German style beers, it would finish last, but that would be unfair because this is a light beer.

For what this is, a low alcohol, low calorie beer, this is, by far, the best beer I have ever tasted."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,2.87,"The scores reflect my company Beck's Light to all other beers possible, but really you would want to review it against other beers in it's category: Light Beer.

Pros:

A lot of flavor for 64 calories. Against other super low calorie beers the difference in taste, and feel, is remarkable. It is also filling like it's calorie high original. Though it does this by being quite foamy. The low alcohol content and filling quality of this beer means you can nurse them all night and not get drunk. You can sober up nursing a six pack of these!

Cons:

Bloated from the fizz. If you intent to get drunk by drinking this you might want to think again. You'd have to have a hearty ability to drink!

Overall: I like this beer when I go to a poker party. Everyone wants to do shots and drink. But they don't know I'm drinking a beer that will sober you up. They assume it's German and therefore must have lots of alcohol. Great beer if you are the DD. You can nurse them and never get drunk."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,1.92,"I recently made a field trip our to Subs & Six Packs on Columbia Avenue while running another errand. I saw this in the cooler & when I realized that I had never heretofore reviewed it, I seized upon the opportunity.

From the bottle: ""Beck's Quality Brewed Under the German Purity Law of 1516"".

I Pop!ped the cap only to get a wafting odor of old Noble hops and corn silage. Ugh. I upended the bottle to get it over with & briefly got two fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps for my trouble. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 -2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like Saaz hops that had seen better days, along with a corn malodor that did nothing for me. Ugh. Mouthfeel was thin & watery. Ugh. The taste was just more watered-down AAL, corn & Noble hops wasted in a brew that can only be intended for the uninitiated. Ugh. Finish left me with a good case of buyer's regret. Ugh."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,2.38,"not all that bad for a light beer. It still has a full flavor and body to it unlike most light beers so that's a plus, a negative though is that it is super light on ABV% at 2.3% so you're gonna end up drinking a lot of them just to get a good buzz."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,1.6,"Slight grainy smell, but that's it. Not much smell at all. Not good or bad.

Standard light beer color. Maybe a bit lighter than usual.

The taste, however... it's like someone mixed a tablespoon of Stella into a cup of lightly carbonated seltzer. I don't mind the taste of light beer, but not when it's diluted to this extent. Somehow, it manages to be one of the most offensive flavors I've ever experienced.

This remains the only beer I've ever come close to not finishing. I guess this is how beer snobs feel when they drink a macro lager. I'd honestly recommend it just to see how bad it is. Buy a six pack and share it with your friends. Find out how close you really are."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,1.98,"Got this at a reception in DC.
Smell: not that much smell.
Taste: Very watery and bland, doesn't taste like anything. Some skunky smell.
Overall: Not a beer at all."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,2.25,"A-Pours a light golden color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has lemongrass hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a crisp lemongrass flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent lager"
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,4.22,"I read many of the reviews. This is a Light Beer folks...it will not taste like the ""full bodied"" (regular) Becks Beer.

Look: A little pale in color, but no different from other Light Beers.

Smell: I read comments on how ""skunky"" it smells, it smells about the same as the full bodied Becks (to me).

Taste: I think Becks Light taste great, less ""body"" than the regular Becks, but still taste like Becks (to me).
This is not a Craft Beer, and cannot compete against good Craft Beers. Remember, the only other Light Beers with 64 calories are ""Miller 64"" and ""Miller Genuine Draft 64"", and this taste much better than they do.

Feel: Becks Light Beer lacks the ""full bodied"" presence of the regular Becks Beer, and the head is not note worthy.

Overall: I like the beer for what it is (a European style beer with only 64 calories per 12oz. bottle), not what it is not. It is not a Craft Beer (not even close), but if you like this style of beer, it taste quite good. I drink it all year round as my standard Light Beer, and enjoy many fine Craft Beers as well. Indeed, because I drink this light beer regularly, I really enjoy other good beers too.

Conclusion: If you accept this beer for what it is (a mass produced Light Beer) it is quite good, and certainly better (to me) than Michelob Ultra, Miller Light, Miller 64, Miller Genuine Draft 64,Bud light, and others. It is a great every day beer."
Worst,Beck's Premier Light,2.39,"Just had this at a BBQ, not exactly by choice, but thought it would be funny to try. Swampy mouthfeel ruins it. Low carbonation for a light beer. It has the skunkiness of a Kolsch style but it is very watered down. You
would need to drink a case to get buzzed."
Worst,Old Milwaukee,2.09,"Old Milwaukee Beer

The look of it : A finger of head that quickly goes away. Yellow golden color. Light carbonation. Nothing special about it.

The smell of it: Sweet grain and some corn

The taste of it: Taste like a newspaper.

So overall would I recommend it ? NO ! Wanna have a cheap beer, go get a Pabst !

Would i buy it again ? No"
Worst,Old Milwaukee,3.57,"I rather like this stuff. For a mass-produced beer, I find that it has a unique characteristic taste which hits the spot sometimes. This is a notch above the rest of the pack. Its still just a plain old american adjunct lager, but its a good example of the style imo."
Worst,Old Milwaukee,2.25,"Ok, now i'm confused. Two old millwaters listed on here from two different breweries. Had to give them the same rating. I believe the one we drank in college was brewed by either Schlitz or Stroh's. I am not sure and it really doesn't matter."
Worst,Old Milwaukee,2.43,"Leftover from a party a couple of weekends ago. Served cold in a pint glass. Figured if I was going to drink it, might as well review it. Gave it 2.5 across the board last time.

Appearance - pale piss yellow color, with two fingers of fluffy white head that dissipate very quickly. Lots of bubbles and good clarity.

Smell - Some general light grain aroma, possibly some corn. Not anything else.

Taste - Thin with initially a touch of grain and some corn sweetness and cooked veggies to close. Not great but worse certainly exists. Nothing too weird going on with after flavors.

Mouthfeel - Thin, fizzy and otherwise non-descript.

Overall - Decidedly mediocre, however worse AAL's are certainly out there and this is enjoyable enough if you're thirsty enough or its hot enough outside."
Worst,Old Milwaukee,2.09,A eater boring beer with few good qualities. Can be great for a fishing trip or camping but must be served ice cold and downed without to much consideration. At least the can looks ok.
Worst,Old Milwaukee,1.96,Honestly for the price you can't go wrong. There are much better lagers out there but at 19.99 for a case or 24 dollars for a 15 can pack you can't go wrong. A good camping beer served ice cold out of the cooler or mixed with clam if that's your thing.
Worst,Old Milwaukee,2.24,"Poured from a big bottle.

Very clear pale yellow color. Strong white head that disappears in no time. Sweet corn adjuncts dominate then blandness follows. Nothing truly offensive but it`s a bore and belongs at the low end of the spectrum."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.36,"L: Standard golden yellow lager, little lacing
S: Extremely sweet like sour apple candy, not like beer.
T: Still pretty bad. Burnt vanilla, corn, and green apples (standard for Minhas Brewing, similar to the Boxer beers). The harsh taste masks the high alcohol content.
F: Not as bad as the taste, but weird texture, luckily goes away quick. Carbonation is reasonable.
Overall: Only buy this for the awesome can design and to prank your friends by asking them to drink it."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.27,"This stuff is barely drinkable as with all high gravity malt liquors, this one is sweet and it has very little head and it leaves no lacing. This one is no good, try at your own risk"
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.77,"Jaguar Hi Gravity Lager. Nice powerful name. Got this from my son, he likes cool looking cans. I think he had one, and said ""here dad you can review these""...ha ho lets go. Hope this is a step up from my previous malt liquor reviews.
Poured into a pint glass, nice golden yellow, with a lot of head, but left quick.
They aroma, ah what can I say, I really dont know what the hell it is...perfumy, metallic, damp straw thats starting to mold? Not overpowering, but different.
Taste, very carbonated feel that leaves a really smooth texture on the tongue, a grassy, wheatie, slightly watery brew. As the brew continues to warm, the smoothness hangs in there even as the metal becomes more present. An interesting note, a white wine like flavour is coming on, kinda like a Carlo Rossi jug wine Chablis. This is beginning to go down too easy, trouble is on the way. Not something I'd seek out, but too late it found me. Good snough I mean enough ;/"
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.7,"Part of a trifecta from the liquor store. We had gotten this in by mistake along with other Melanie products. The manager offered me a can of this along with Evil Eye (We were liquidating stock) I took it home and poured it into my Jack Daniel's pint glass. It was a pale straw color. Winey along with green apples. Legs were left on the glass. After finishing this, I curled up into the fetal position and wanted to die."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.66,"Jaguar High Gravity Lager has a medium, white, fizzy, quickly-dissipating head, no lacing, and a clear, very bubbly, yellow-golden appearance. The aroma is of subtle and sickening green apple, grain husks, barley, sickly-sweetness, and a shadow of hops. The mouthfeel is light to medium, and Jaguar finishes somewhat crisp and refreshing, but also somewhat harsh. This is pretty hard to stomach, and I think it's not even worth trying. Avoid!

RJT"
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.5,"This beer will immediately make you question life.
Why am I doing this to myself?

Pale anemic gold color, flecks of lace that ring the glass. Looks yellow, almost green. Not much in the way of retention, dead glassy surface after a few minutes.

Smells like white grapes, sweet cereal, froot loops, vitamins, and a general lack of self respect.

Tastes like the same. Crap adjuncts, added sugars. Sticky, mealy, astringent feel. Deadening alcohol on the palate. Sweet grainy taste, some fusels. Pretty rough, though not the utter worst i've experienced. This is nothing more than a cheap buzz in a shitty package. Avoid if you possess any shred of dignity.

Yes, I bought this for the stupid can graphics."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,"Big thanks to Chris (spycow) for finding this in an out-of-the-way Wisconsin gas station. Apparently this was less than a dollar. Served in a BeerAdvocate taster glass.

A - Quick-dissolving white foam settles to a near-transparent cap, leaving spotty lace behind. Slightly lighter than Earthquake but similarly bubbly.

S - Compared to Earthquake this is downright terrible. Alcohol, rotting fruit and garbage, and god knows what else.

T - Taste is a tiny bit better, as it dials down the rotten flavors and replaces them with sickeningly cloying sweetness. Not as boozy as some of the other malt liquors, although this is a ""light"" one at 8.3%.

M - Surprisingly chewy texture, with a dry finish but tooth-coating stickiness. Not as much heat as Earthquake unsurprisingly. Carbonation is moderate to low. Somewhat indescribable, and not in a good way.

D - This may be the worst ""true"" Malt Liquor we've had so far, although there's always a chance one of the other gems will usurp the throne. A must-try for lovers of bad beer."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.21,"Brewed and bottled by Mountain Crest in Monroe, Wisconsin. This means brewed by the Minhas Craft Brewery. Maybe it used to be brewed by City for Melanie.

This 8.3% malt liquor pours a glowing yet dark golden yellow in color. There is a quarter to half inch of foamy white head. The aroma is strangely fruity for a lager. There is cherry, green apple, tropical fruity and a strange chemically-alcohol aroma. I hope this tastes better than it smells. Whoa, it does not taste better. In fact it tastes worse. This is like a chemical fruity alcohol cleaning product. This is atrocious and all but undrinkable. If your goal is to get drunk cheap, there are better-tasting alternatives."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.03,"Poured a sort of bright yellow color with a good amount of quickly dissipating white head it. Smell is solid alcohol and not good at that. Smells terrible, no redeeming beer smell qualities at all. Taste is god-awful. I wish I was exaggerating but this is complete shit. It's only 8.3%, but tastes like pure alcohol. Got some bubbles towards the end, light mouthfeel but the tastes ruins any chance of this beer going down smoothly. It's surprising but this beer is even worse than I remembered it being. I will not be drinking this ever again."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.18,"Clear pale straw color with a puffy white collar that leaves a little bit of lacing.

Aroma was malty sweet, with a little sugar mixed in. Maybe some graininess.

Taste was horrible. Cloying sweetness that just astounds me. WHY? Not quite as wretched as in a Minahs brew, but it's still wretched.

Feel was slick and oily and nothing pleasing.

I tried to guzzle as much as I could, but could only handle a handful of sips...drinking any more is a waste. Good thing the drain is always thirsty."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.81,"In honor of the recent lunacy in our neighbor state, I decided to go with a self-proclaimed ""union made"" beer out of Monroe, WI. Gotta love cans labeled with animals. Sconnies...

A: Golden blonde with a weak white head. Good clarity and looks like a light summer beer.

S: Corn, musty unidentified adjunct, and a bit of banana. Pretty mild, but what is there is not desirable.

T: Sweet and fruity. Not sure where this is coming from, but I get lime and cloying banana. Strange, and not in a particularly good way.

M; Smooth with fine carbonation and a bit of alcohol bite.

Flavor is bizarre, like some Zima somehow found its way into the tank. This started out as a peculiarity, but by the time I finished the 22oz, it was a nauseating chore. Not quite bad enough to make the list of worst malt liquors, but this is classic SKIP ENJOYMENT AND GO STRAIGHT TO INTOXICATION."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.49,"Served in a snifter.

And SwillFest 1.5 rolls on! And in geodesic snifters, no less! What better vessel for such a libation, eh? When I saw this can a few months ago, my mind pulled for me to purchase it. But I demurred. Then, upon seeing this on a more recent beer run to Kenosha, I felt it had to come into my possession.

Which leads to today. it pours a clear apple juice topped by a finger or so of quick-dying white foam. The nose is indeed how Senor Chandler (below) described it, with cotton candy stalks dancing with remnants of vinyl and motor oil (I don't get the rest of the factory, but, then again, I ain't Woody, be I?). The simple strangeness of it is actually pretty impressive, though in the wrong way. The taste takes a slightly different tack, more closely resembling some yammy WD-40. Yeah. Seriously. This is some godawful shit, lemme tell ya. The body feels heavier than it probably is (bad tastes weigh more than good ones, maybe?), with a light moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a dry finish. Overall, nothing about this horrid thing makes me want to ever drink it again. It was all I could do to muster up the strength to down the rest of my glass, hoping against hope that only the minimum would actually touch my tongue and harangue my 'buds. Only one word for this: Yicchleggh.

On a strange note, feeling oddly empowered (if that's the right word), I decided to add some Tabasco to what remained in my glass after emptying the can. I dripped in some of Mike's old sauce (best by label read ""03/2010"") and gulped some down, much to the painful glee of those witnessing the act. To my surprise, the taste was akin to Crazy Ed's. Now where's the shooting star running over my head?"
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.68,"Served in a snifter

Thanks to TMoney2591 for giving me this...I think

There is too much malt liquor for my liking. This liquor pours a golden color with not much head at all. The smell is equivalent to sniffing pepto bismal...I'm not sure why. This beer is odd, but hell, it's JAGUAR. The taste felt like a jaguar mauled my taste buds. There is an acrid horrible feeling that I wish I had never ever EVER tasted. The mouthfeel is smooth but horrible, I don't know how else to describe it. The drinkability is DON'T."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,2.31,"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head.

Feels light in the mouth and is not very drinkable. Overall this is a beer best avoided."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.25,"I CAN't believe it! Here is a beer that is already a solid ""F"", albeit after just two reviews, and here comes The CANQuest (TM). I am not holding out much hope.

Another ""Union Made"" CAN! I am a unionist, but this kind of thing makes me shake my head in wonder. I tried, really, to generate some head but to no avail. The white foam fell as quickly as I could pour. Color was a pretty golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was the unpleasant combination of plastics factory and cotton CANdy. How do they achieve this? it is ungodly! Mouthfeel was thin-to medium with an inherent sweetness that would throw a diabetic into a coma. OMFG! This is nearly unfit for human CANsumption. Finish left me gasping for air. Oof."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.36,"Saw this at one of the local beer stores and thought WTF? It looks so bad that I just gotta try it. Super high ABV, but I figured that I'll probably end up drain pouring it anyway... and at $1.79 there's nothing to loose!

A - Deep gold and clear with a persistent fluffy white head. Head retention on this one is actually outstanding... but then again some hotel hot tubs have outstanding froth retention too. No, seriously... this doesn't look bad at all, at least after you pour it into a glass and hide the horrid looking can.

S - This is pretty transparent, which is a good thing for super high alcohol cans of hobo booze. A little fusel alcohol overripe fruitiness come out, along with the standard cornflake cheap malt note.

T - Ahk! This is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE I SAY! It doesn't even taste like beer. This tastes like someone drank a couple budweisers chased with a quart of honey and 20 assorted pixie sticks... and then puked. And then you drank that puke. Yep, that about sums it up.

M - Filthy. I'm going to go brush my teeth.

D - Hell no. This is NASTY."
Worst,Jaguar High Gravity Lager,1.78,"Welcome to Malt Likkapalooza VII. Today's feature bout will be between yet another pair of malt liquors brewed in the state of Wisconsin. I find it hard to believe that dozens of different variations are even possible when it comes to beer like this. I guess minor changes in sugar content and ABV are enough to earn new can graphics. Anyway, on with the show...

Amber with a generous splash of orange; definitely the darker of these two combatants. The head is bone white in color, a finger or two smaller and doesn't look as good as the head on the other beer. The early lead goes to Camo Silver Ice.

The nose reminds me of apples macerated in grain alcohol. I still don't think that beer of this style (even the worst examples) smells as bad as the worst macro lagers, but that's just me. In any case, this one isn't likely to win any prizes.

Neither one of these two is anywhere close to good beer. I mean that in a general sense and when compared to the best malt liquors out there. Jaguar is excessively grainy and is more boozy than malty sweet. It may not be possible to brew a high gravity lager with such a high ABV that's worth a damn. I'm pretty sure I've had some decent ones though.

Who really cares about the mouthfeel in a malt liquor? They're both par for the style course, with a medium-full slickness that doesn't quite reach sticky. Zippy carbonation keeps things moving along without feeling overly fizzilicious.

Malt Likkapalooza VII has not been a stellar showing for either one of these brews. Jaguar has the cooler can, so that counts for something. Of course, it doesn't really matter since the brown paper bag will ensure that the can graphics can't be seen anyway. Bottom line: there may not be many cheaper ways to get drunk, but there have to be more pleasant ways."
Worst,Beck's Light,2.02,"Weak ass yellow appearance, more water than malt apparently. No head. Aroma watered down the skunk I dig on from the regular version, but it wasn't ""bad"" per se, just missing.

Mild bitterness, especially for the lack of hops and body for the beer. So much water in this beer."
Worst,Beck's Light,2.25,"Sampled last night on 11/27/14 but had this once before a few years back. Used to be made in Bremen, Germany BUT now made in St. Louis, Missouri by Budweiser. The alcohol content isn't listed on the label but I am guessing like 3%. Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled glass ""BECK'S"" stein.

Brew pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Nothing really to mention for any lacing. The aroma is on the 'skunky' side (seems like MOST beers in a green bottle is like this for some reason) with some grains. Pretty much the same is said for the taste also with a metallic tasting soda water style flavor that is very watered down.. Nothing special here at all and won't try it again. Light bodied with high carbonation."
Worst,Beck's Light,1.95,"slight skunky aroma and taste
Appearance was a bland uninspiring yellow
Palate- carbonated with a light bodied feel
Overall- I was completely blown away by how bad this was. I didn't expect this beer to be that bad. I think it is in the same class as Coors Light"
Worst,Beck's Light,2.39,"A-golden but nothing special

T-watered down metallic taste with very little malt and corn taste. Not original becks made in the USA now and tastes like skunks natty light

Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.31,"Imagine the most artificial strawberry flavor you can, now add the flavor of throwing up tequila. That, is strawberita. At 25 ounces and 8% ABV, this is a Four Loko that doesn't make you immediately commit felonies. Would you like a diverse flavor profile? Would you like something complex or subtle? Do you want to enjoy a beverage? This is not the drink for you. Do you want to get significantly toasty with two cans for $7.00 at your local grocery store? Do you want to drink bottom shelf wine while maintaining some semblance of manhood? Do you enjoy vomit or sugar hangover headaches? This, my friend, is the drink for you. Enjoy at your own risk, but only if you're broke, under 25, a woman, or have a death wish. Cheers."

Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.79,"Pours a shock of red Kool-aid, no head formation. Strong whiff of intensely fake strawberry liquor, essentially liquid Jello shots in a glass. Taste follows that road precisely. Feel is thick, sugary, and raw, like a dessert before its cooked."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,4.7,"Straw-Ber-Rita has no foam nor lacing, but it does have lots of bubbles and a semi-clear red color. The aroma is of strawberry drink, and the flavor is of that, too, with some pale malt & tartness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Straw-Ber-Rita finishes drying, in that high-fructose corn syrup fashion.

Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.88,"(25 oz can, code 19173; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)

L: cloudy, fruit-punch colored liquid; foam on pour, quickly collapses to nothing, persistent activity of bubbles rising (observance mostly copied from my recent review of the Lime-a-Rita)

S: strawberry Big League Chew - no other way to describe it... intense, but little booze presence... ok, well, yes the 'margarita' (lime) element does slowly emerge

T: whoa, not 'strawberry' really - fake, artificial, sweets-injected strawberry; gummy strawberry... now I gotta know what's in artificial strawberry - 25% fruit essence, 75% sugar?... this doesn't have the pool liner highlight that the reg. Lime' has - is it more pool float?... the flavorings in this bury the 'malt beverage' base more than their standard Lime-a-Rita

F: it's not all-out syrupy, but there's definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8%, the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence, but nonetheless a tad too weighty (also mostly, entirely copied from my Lime-a-Rita review - finding out these things are one-note)

O: thought the taste of this would wash out that of the 'flagship' Lime-a-Rita I just had moments ago, and boy was I right... this is seriously carbonated (malty) strawberry Mad Dog 20 20... the flavorings of these are to-taste with everyone, naturally, but 2 brands in, and it's apparent each variation was designed to appeal to an adolescent palate (1468)"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2,"Clear light pink liquid with small white head. Aroma of strawberries, sugar, boost, grain and sugar. Taste is medium to high sweet and light bitter with notes of strawberries, sugar and boost. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Awful."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1.64,"24 Oz Can poured into glass
Look - Pinkish red cloudy. No foam or lacing.
Smell - Identical aroma to Mountain Dew Code Red.
Taste - I bought this to give it a try because i like margaritas. This doesn't taste like a margarita and is too carbonated to even remotely be similar. I knew it would be not like a authentic margarita but it isn't close enough. It tastes like mountain dew soda, can't even pick up the alcohol. The sweetness level is nuts. It needs more lime or strawberry flavor and less sugar. The only real fruit flavor is cherry.

Well live and learn, won't be messing with this mess of a beverage again. Should have known better. Grade is D-"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,5,"I love everything about the Straw-Ber-Rita drink. The sweet smell, sweet-yet tart flavor and pleasant color. I am totally hooked on the taste and relaxed feeling I get after drinking a couple small cans or one big can. I love the Lime and pineapple flavors of this too. Not so much the mango. For the record, if I wanted a regular non sweetened tasting beer, I'd go for Samuel Adams Lager, though the original Bud Light is acceptable too."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,1,"My spouse bought a case of this for a guest who was staying with us, thinking she might like it. She didn't. I had one. It was awful. After this stuff sat ignored in our fridge for awhile, we gave it to a neighbor who drinks a lot of Bud Light. Later we discovered a fugitive can in the back of the fridge. We threw it out. Good riddance.

I can't believe there is a market for this swill. Horrible."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.97,"Poured from the can into a Budweiser pilsner glass.

A giant bit of fizz, with a fast dissolving and noisy pink/purple like head. No puck or collar, and some very fast soda cabonation. Body color is a neon Hawaiian Punch color, a sort of dark neon pink and red.

The aroma is just massive as soon as the can is opened. It smells like Hawaiian Punch and incredibly sticky sweet. There is to credit though a mix of rock salt and lime giving off the instant margarita in a slushy machine vibe so it's at least true to form.

Palate is a bit of a surprise. Slight syrup but not totally in feel. Touches of boozy fruit strawberry, and a bit of sugar but not horribly. Lime tang a bit in the mid palate that makes for a good contrast to the non strawberry sweetness. Once again, alcohol goes right into your gut and system.

This was one of the more enjoyable ones of the series I had, but it comes with the usual and obvious faults. Can't see myself having more than 2 of these in a sitting and enjoying myself."

Worst,Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,2.33,My wife keeps purchasing this and figured I'd give it a try. Very light pink in color. Has a very fruity sugary smell. Very strong alcohol taste and very fruity.
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.24,"Purchased as a 24oz can, poured into a pint glass.

A - Pours a golden color. Initially thick foamy white head recedes quickly; poor head retention and no lacing. Lots of small bubbles rising through the brew.

S - Adjuncts, alcohol, and malty notes abound. ABV is not very well hidden here.

T - Malt and sweet corn to start, with fusels and a faint sour apple flavor showing up on the finish. Not as egregiously tart as Stack 101 but it's noticeable.

M - Thin-bodied with medium carbonation. It goes down relatively easily, but the mouthfeel of this HGL leaves much to be desired outside of that.

O - It has a cool can design and the product is inoffensive enough not to be a drain pour, but nothing about it really invites me to try it again. Tick complete. Reviewed to style, YMMV."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.68,"A random pickup from a local wine store's cooler, I couldn't ask for a lower price on a themed drink to go alongside my D&D game later that day, which featured a similar dog creature.

The upsides of this beer stop about there.

While not bad, nothing about this beer stood out from under the label. Drinking straight from the can, I can't speak of colour or clarity, though a lager that doesn't try to coat me with the head foam as I open it isn't trying hard enough.

The most appealing feature of this brew seems to be the 24oz can of 8% ABV for around $2, since I'd compare it to the big brand light beers, but trying too hard to be bursting with the wrong sort of flavours."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.94,"Drank from a 24 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Very attractive, almost looks like a fancy craft beer. Stands out nicely on the shelf. Doesn't look at all like a malt liquor.

Smell - Tiny wisp of corn, mostly metallic water.

Taste - Like a brownie covered in black pepper. Incredibly sweet, slightly chocolatey, and a strong alcohol bite.

Feel - Thin body, very mild fizz, and some throat burn. It needs to either be thicker or bubblier.

Overall - I had low expectations based on its $1.50 price tag, and it hit them. It's not good, but it isn't offensive. I'd have it again, but it definitely wouldn't be a first pick."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.05,"Why am I rating this? The hell if I know, let's say desperate times call for desperate measures.
Poured into what? Uhmmmm...just a regular pint glass.
The appearance was a glossy clear yellow to mild orange color with speedy carbonation rising to fill a rapidly dieing head. No lace.
The aroma had stiff sweet corn, rice, fusel alcohol and burnt grass.
The flavor had a huge alcoholic sweet buffing throwing itself into burnt grass, burnt toast and sweet corn. The aftertaste was distracting through fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt grass and toast.
The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with no sessionability whatsoever. It's a sipper by all means, that's if one wants to sip it. Carbonation did feel appropriate for what this is supposed to be. ABV seemed as projected. Finish was fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt toast.
Overall, didn't really like this at all for me but without being too harsh, I realize this style doesn't really clean up too well. Keep trying, maybe a brewer out there eventually will be able to brew a kickass version of this. I seriously doubt this brewery will."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.89,"This beer tastes like watered down Natty Daddy. It has a slightly greater fruity taste, but it's subtle. The can is interesting with an orange color and Cerberus design. If you want to get buzzed for cheap you can't beat it."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.6,"Pours a perfectly crystal clear light yellow. A white fizzy head dies quickly.

Aroma of corn, spent grain, spent hops, and fusel alcohol.

Flavor has a neutral note almost, then the corn and rice sweetness sets in. Small, stale hop does a little to balance, then a soft alcohol note. For 8% it could be more ghastly than it is."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,5,"Nasty yellow color, but it does product a full inch of head, even if it quickly vanishes with no lace, no trace. Aroma was metallic alcohol.

Fuck, the body is thin on this, lots of corn syrup, aluminum and rubbing alcohol. Eventually it starts to numb your senses with the alcohol burn and thin body. Man, I can appreciate some malt liquor, but this is asking too much of me."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.44,"A: The beer is clear amber yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light aromas of sweet malts are preset in the nose—corn seems to stand out in particular along with faint hints of alcohol.
T: The taste follows the smell, but flavors of alcohol start to creep in. There is a lingering aftertaste of alcohol in the finish.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer isn't nearly as offensive compared to some of the other malt liquors that I've had.

Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.19,"Bought this at my local Kwik Fill after getting out of work. Wanted to try something I haven't had before.
Appearance: Golden malt liquor color. Didn't actually know this was considered Malt Liquor by most people.
Smell: Smells like your average american adjunct brew.
Taste: Really isn't bad, but isn't necessarily amazing either. Pretty average and definitely tastes more like an ale for a high gravity brew. Disguises the alcohol well.
Feel: Decent carbonation, and again this one tastes and feels just like a typical lager/ale all the way through.
Overall: Anyone who takes a look at the can before buying knows that this is something that is going to get you buzzed quickly. And for that, you should already know.49 what you are getting into (especially when you are paying less than 2 dollars for 24 ounces). I thought that for the style and price, this was a decent brew. I wouldn't seek this one out, but when I am looking to get my buzz on, this would definitely be an option. I paid $1.49 for this. Considering Blue Moon is the next step above this, and that you would have to drink two BM's to achieve the same buzz, this gives you the best bang for your buck (a pint of Blue Moon in my area is $2.20). I was also happy to find out Genesee Brewing Co. based out of Rochester where I am from, made this and not some mainstream Maco company like Coors or Bud Light which amazingly dominates the market. Overall, read my review and decide for yourself if this is something you would want to spend your pennies on. To each his own, but I would drink this again if I intended to get a buzz and enjoy a decent brew."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,3.13,"From the 24 fl oz can. Sampled on July 1, 2015.

Yellow pour. White head that fades.

Toasted biscuit, corn, and grassy hops on the nose.

Smoother than some malt liquors. Not cloying. A thin body.

The flavor has this strange vegetable oil character with the toasted biscuit and grassy hops. Not a headache-inducing malt liquor like so many of them can be for me. So that puts it in a slightly higher class IMO."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,3.42,"Rock Wall Brewing Co. ""Dog Bite High Gravity Lager""
24 oz. can, no freshness dating
$1.79 @ Weis Market, Conshohocken, PA

Dog Bite is a surprisingly fruity malt liquor, delivering notes of apple and grape. It was so fruity in fact that I had to check the label to make sure it wasn't flavored. As to its being a ""lager"", yes it's lager yeast, but it's clearly fermented warm.

It appears in the glass like any other malt liquor with a deep golden body beneath a short head of white foam. The head retention is fairly good, and it actually leaves some really nice, although thin, lacing about the glass. It's somewhere between medium and medium-full in body, and just below standard carbonation at maybe 2.4 volumes CO2/liter which leaves it smooth across the palate.

The aroma is malty with the suggestion of fruit and a touch of alcohol.

Beyond the fruitiness there is alcohol, but it's not ""hot"", and there's also a note of sugary, almost mint (which may or may not be coming from hops) as well as a pleasant note of cereal and some floral character. It's not overly sweet though, especially for a malt liquor, and despite its limited bitterness it's still able to dry in the finish; and that's great because unlike many others in the category it doesn't build upon the palate.

Although I was initially surprised by the fruity component, it's not something negative within the style, and is actually pleasant. It gives it some character and charm. For fans of the style I'd say you have to check it out."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,1.48,Sometimes you get what you buy. I don't know what I expected but what I got was a flashy can and a bad taste in my mouth. If you just wanna get drunk and can hold your nose than go for it.
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,3.14,"24 oz. can
Served in a Firestone Walker pils glass

A - It pours a crisp golden color that is devoid of any floating imperfections. The effervescent body continuously feeds a brilliant white cloud of foam that leaves traces of its presence down the side of the glass.

S - It has an initial sweet candy aroma. Upon further investigation I discover the scent of candied apple and some floral notes.

T - The taste begins sweet with some grain flavors. Then a floral taste crosses my palate. Then I get smacked with the alcohol. Then, as quickly as it came, the alcohol taste subsides leaving a clean, crisp finish.

M - Thin with biting carbonation.

O - This beer starts out a little harsh. Once the 8% numbs my tongue it becomes rather easy to drink. It is an exemplary example of an underappreciated style."
Worst,Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,2.83,"A little too sweet, good price for the quality. Anything is better than Bud or Coors, right? The aroma isn't bad. The name is catchy and reminiscent of upstate New York. I usually drink lager or ale warm, but this was ice cold. No way can I drink more than 4 oz. Just a bit too flavorful and I might gain weight. Italians make their beer and wines too sweet."

L: brilliantly-clear, pale brass-colored liquid; fizzy, fleeting white foam on the pour, gone in two minutes, leaving a thin collar... no lacing

S: grain husk, hint of sulfur, light lemony accent... relatively high intensity; could smell it as it poured

T: surprisingly bold flavors, crackery and doughy malt, of course cut rather dry, but with that husky flavor swelling up in the aftertaste... after a few beats, some bready and lemon pithy notes emerge and linger

F: smooth, light-bodied flow... not much contour or drag... mildly fizzy; light peppery warmth... dry, but not cut, clipped, or parching... if it was slightly more cut, quick, and honed, it'd be darn near perfect

O: despite the age of the bottle, this example was in relatively good condition and I'm pleased that it was more than passable and enjoyable for its kind... I could totally see getting this as a cheap, palate-cleaning accompaniment to wings (1965)"

L - Pale, very clear amber with zero head.
S - Whole-grain sliced bread, bran flakes, and deer feed. Not much else.
T - Molasses and bran are pretty upfront, and is quickly followed by a vile flavor along the lines of a musky old bread that's been left in the hot sun for two or three weeks. Fairly sweet, with nothing to balance it out. Reminds me almost of Ipecac syrup...
F - Thick, with minimal carbonation. Not easy to drink.
O - It's pretty hard to fuck up worse than the original O'Doul's, but they managed to do it with this one! For the price, I would pay ten times the amount for you to NOT make me drink this. I have a feeling it would be slightly less terrible if it was well-carbonated. I mean, it'd still be awful, but it'd be drinkable!

L: polished-clear, tawny-colored liquid; amber-tinged foam on the pour, which all but disappears, leaving only a razor-thin collar

S: relatively mute aroma expression... lightly-worty, brown bread crust... no off-putting off-aromas; just dull

T: Vienna lager-like?, but one that's old and perhaps slightly oxidized... bold, yet dry apple juice overtone... the aftertaste is near bone dry with a mellow caramel note most prominent, also a low-moderate, neutral bitterness, and maybe a mild toasted bread around the edges... really it tastes almost syrup/concentrate-like

F: might as well be flat; the little tingle it lends gives a flicker of life to its coiled light body... the little bit of pudge up front swells then vanishes

O: probably not supposed to pour this in a glass?? ... I guess I should have expected such bland blandness... the code suggests this bottle is almost a year old; maybe I'll take another crack at this in the future ... interesting run of NA brands leading up to this milestone review (1750)"
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,2.5,"BOTTLE courtesy of the Props department on a TV show I worked on.

Better than Coors Edge, but still on the sweeter side and imbalanced as a result. Cereal grains, amber malt, faint toastiness. No real hop flavour is present. Has appealing caramelization but the lack of balancing hop bitterness renders this beer out of balance.

I think the toastiness of the amber malt gives this an edge over many of the more watery low/no alcohol beers, but it's not a good beer any way you come at it.

High D+ / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,2.58,"Pours clear, amber in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is toasted malt and white sugar. Light bodied, sweet with moderate carbonation. Better than the original and drinkable but doesn't compare with more modern non alcoholic beer. Certainly serviceable in a pinch."

I was not a fan of this brew at all, if you’re sticking to NA beers there are far superior ones out there. The NA market is one in just discovering and I think this is probably bottom of the barrel when it comes to this style."

I'm not of fond of O'Doul's Amber as I am the original O'Doul's but as far as Non-alcoholic beers go they're both pretty damned good. This is crystal clear with a copper colored body beneath a short head of off-white foam. The head retention and lacing are average. The aroma offers some grainy malt with just a hint of caramel and even less hops but it does smell like beer. The flavor gives you a little too much of that maltiness upfront and the first sip let's you know you're drinking an NA. The good news is that after that it tastes very close to a full alcohol beer, and there's some additional biscuity malt and some mild floral and lightly herbal hop character to it. It's perfectly balanced by a moderate bitterness and it finishes fairly dry with just a touch of malt remaining. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and crisp with a standard carbonation. Overall it's a nice NA.

Worst,O'Doul's Amber,3.88,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/20/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden/orange/amber color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of honey, brown sugar, cracker, white bread dough/crust, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of caramel, nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Touch of fruitiness and the usual NA cardboard aroma, but really minimal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, brown sugar, cracker, white bread dough/crust, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of caramel, nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of honey, brown sugar, cracker, white bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, caramel, nuttiness, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, no fruity/yeasty notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Overall this is a very nice NA amber lager. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery at all. Very clean and nicely rich dark/bready malt complexity, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. A very enjoyable and amazing offering for the style. This lacks nearly all of the usual off flavors/astringency I have seen with some other ones, as with the pale version."
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,3.88,"Mistake some reviewers make is to judge an NA Beer as a regular beer and then wonder why it is not great; NO NA Beer is going to compete with regular beer; AS an NA Beer O'Doul's Amber is very good and when you find out that for health reasons, you need to lay off the beer for awhile or more; this is a very good NA Beer."
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,3.94,"Clear light amber with two fingers of white five minute head.
Smell is grainy with a hint of grassy hops.
Taste is malty with just a hint of grassy hops.
Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Finish is lightly dry and balanced.
Overall a better than average n/a beer."
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,2.94,"Pours a clear copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, sorghum, and NA grainy/earthiness. Fits the style of a Low Alcohol Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, sweet malt, sorghum, hint of citrus hop, and NA grainy/earthiness. Overall, for a Low Alcohol Beer this was actually pretty decent."
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,5,"I love drinking O'Douls because it's non-alcoholic. I have to take Dilaudid and Hydromorph Contin which are opioid medications. I have Lumbar Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Disc Disease, because of these chronic lower back pain conditions I need to take these Narcotic pain medications. If I was to drink beer with alcohol it would kill me.

Thanks to O'Douls I get to enjoy beer again without the alcohol. O'Douls tastes so bloody good and on a hot summers day it's very refreshing!! Thank you Anheuser-Busch for making O'Douls so people like me who can't drink alcohol can still enjoy an ice cold beer. I'm sorry that this isn't a better beer review but I'm not a professional beer reviewer."
Worst,O'Doul's Amber,2.15,"Had this one out the bottle, it had a very malty smell. The taste was pretty watery but the malt was there and a slight hint of hops. The feel wasn't too good, it had a fruity/watery after taste."
Worst,Tecate Light,2.99,"Had on tap. Straw in color with almost no head. Light on the smell, malt, slight sweet. Slightly sweet on the flavor, malt and grain. More flavorful than expected, light and smooth."
Worst,Tecate Light,2.67,"L: pours a very pale straw yellow with a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly.

S: Smells like a cheap light lager, notes of corn, sweet apple, maybe a touch of hop.

T: A touch watery, notes of corn and sweet apple, a maybe a very light hop, definitely tastes like a cheap light lager.

F: Light and crisp, very easy drinking.

O: While not great, this is better than some of the light beers."
Worst,Tecate Light,2,"So before ordering this I was served a strong margarita and decided that I needed to slow my roll but keep drinking. Enter Tecate Light. It pours straw yellow with a head that vanishes faster than the beer. Nothing to report on the smell, just typical light lager scents. Taste-wise, its a metal can with corn notes that tastes like strange tap water. Now maybe I am being harsh, but it did go down smooth as its under 4% and is practically a water. Not good if you're looking for flavor and body in your beer, but great after getting knocked down by a heavy marg."
Worst,Tecate Light,3.34,"Look: Clear straw gold, loose white head that dissipates after a few minutes.

Smell: Light sulfur, mineral water. Not a lot going on.

Taste: Since they cut calories with the abv and kept more carbs, it’s way more flavorful than I expected. There’s the typical corn adjunct, some breadiness, a little earthy hops and a crisp, dry finish. It’s not outstanding but there’s no way I can call it “awful”. At 3.9% you could drink this all day long. I am pleasantly surprised.
If your into micheladas, this would be a great starting pointe. If you don’t know what they are, mix 1/3 Clamato with 2/3 beer, add some Tabasco if you like it spicier. I’ve also made them with the same ratio and zing zang Bloody Mary mix."
Worst,Tecate Light,3,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A thin white head dissipates immediately. Color is clear straw with abundant streaming carbonation. Aroma of lightly toasted grain, a hint of corn, a bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Flavor of mild toasted grain, corn, a bit of grassy hops. Overall: thin in body and flavor as expected for the style, but not offensive."
Worst,Tecate Light,2.61,"I did it. I really did. I woke up in ectasty. I woke up in this dream that any person would want to deem reality. Fuck, what I am drinking? I did it. I am here. And I am happy. Metal ass beer tasting or not, let’s live. Let’s believe."
Worst,Tecate Light,1.81,"Full disclosure, Tecate is a fridge staple in my household. That said, I can’t bring myself to drink Tecate Light outside of reviewing purposes. It’s like watered down Tecate, which is itself saying very little. Pass."
Worst,Tecate Light,3.61,"(24 oz can, BBD OCT 2019; purchased single off shelf (room temp)... poured into 28 oz mug)

L: mostly-clear, pale yellow-gold liquid, good bit of fine particulate afloat; loose, bouncy, white foam, which builds high but crumbles swift...

S: immediate relative potency to the smell, mostly sugar cookie, lightly-baked lightly-sweetish dough aromas... relatively poppin', subtle spice; cookie-like all the way

T: dried grassy-grainy angle up front; almost a white wine dry fruit note carrying out the finish, lingers too... white flour, simple cookie dough malt flavor prevalent... lightly spicy, lightly bubblegum aftertaste, with the doughy malt looming large... floury, lightly tangy note dominates

F: mildly effervescent; nondescript body contours... dry and light long after each sip, but with a head-tilting (phenolic?) warmth... does seem to have a bit more body than its contemporaries, but it's still light enough - probably better swilled chilled from can

O: yeah, it has some flavor no doubt, but not much more than Bud Light or other vaguely doughy drones in the lot (1458)"
Worst,Tecate Light,2.85,"From the bottle, it pours a light clear golden color with a decent white head that slowly diminishes as you watch. In the nose, it is grains, possibly corn. In the mouth, it is grainy."
Worst,Tecate Light,2,"Light carbonation and a watery feel. Aroma isnt very strong,mostly a corn grain mix and malt. Maybe a little bread and grainy bread is there also
Taste is a combination of watery,sweet,sugary malt,a little bread
It is exactly as advertised,light in aroma,taste and body. I can see some people enjoying this more than I did but the corn aroma and corn syrupy taste just doesnt work for me"
Worst,Tecate Light,3.09,It poured the expected light straw yellow color with a good head that reduces quickly. The smell is corn and other grains. The taste is a sweet corn that is smooth and easy to drink. Overall nothing to get excited about but it is a easy drink.
Worst,Tecate Light,1.88,"My wife loves to buy me beer, however, she knowingly buys stuff that is less than stellar. An on-going joke between us. This latest installment is a ‘Beer from Mexico’ 12er. And this gem from the pack is about the wateriest beer I’ve ever had...

It does say “light” and it means it with ever fiber of the word - light look, mouthfeel, no smell, and at best a wheaty flavor...At least it was sessionable..."
Worst,Tecate Light,2.8,"Pours that familiar light beer light yellow with lots of clarity and a soft white head in the 1/5"" range once it settles down (quickly). Aroma of some grain, not much beyond that. Lager yeast not really perceptible here.

Taste, a familiar interaction of sparsely used super high alpha acid hops that provide only bitterness and almost nothing in terms of flavor. There are no off flavors or sulphuric badness like in some garbage tier light beers. Its not great or anything, but its probably better than ratings here tend to indicate in the aggregate. Would seem to be nothing wrong and even a welcome respite in the summertime, throw one of these in between some more robust stuff you're drinking, get a little hydrated, shits saul goodman. I'm guessing from the mouthfeel this isn't 100% barley. Not overly sweet like some when you have that corn/corn syrup going on. Lots of carbonation. I think these are worthy of having around in the summer for a hydration and palate cleansing break, as well as for people who aren't that into beer."
Worst,Pacifico Light,2.74,"12oz bottle, review from notes

on my journey through the depths of mexican lager i came across this light beer, my review is simply that i am glad it has 4.5% abv bc it is worthless otherwise

refreshing and can possibly get you drunk"
Worst,Pacifico Light,1.95,"Very watered down, even more than you'd expect for a light beer. I like the Clara a lot more than a traditional Mexican lager, but unfortunately the light one has much less flavor than Clara or even other light beers! Not bad on the beach, but I'd take a Corona or others over this."
Worst,Pacifico Light,1.27,"A watered down version of the Pacifico. Looks clear and pale, white foam head almost non existent. Tastes likes malts and corn. Aroma is sweet like base malts and adjuncts."
Worst,Carlton Draught,1.89,"Can, best by June 29th 2019.

It pours a clear gold with an ample head of foam.

Big corny notes in the smell, hints of vegetables, wee bit of bitterness.

Taste is below that of XXXX Gold. Too much corn,vegetal, metallic.

Body is not better than the XXXX despite its higher abv.

Pretty poor beer."
Worst,Carlton Draught,5,"I love Carlton Draught, it is one of the best beers in the world. The look, smell, taste and feel are comparable with any beer in the world. I could, and do, drink this beer all day.
Why is Carlton Draught called an American Adjunct Lager?
If there is such a thing as heaven and if I do make it there one day I imagine breasting the bar having a Carlton Draught with God while watching the Carlton Football Club win a Premiership."
Worst,Carlton Draught,2.97,By far one of the best original Draught styles available. Full bodied and full flavoured this draught beer offers mild bitterness and value for your money.
Worst,Carlton Draught,2.52,"Format: standard light brown 375mL bottle with a macro label.

Appearance: a dark golden-amber colour with a fluffy white head that drops away quickly. Pretty disappointing.

Aroma: not very much on the nose, just some corn adjuncts and cheap grain. Okay at best.

Taste: not very much again. The cheap grains are joined by a vegetal note. Not particularly offensive, but quite boring.

Aftertaste: the flavours drop away quite quickly. A pretty basic adjunct lager.

Mouth feel: light in body with a medium to higher carbonation. Reasonable.

Overall: I'm really not sold on Carlton Draught. Even their very funny ads aren't enough to make me realise that their other beer VB is cheaper and much better. Carlton Draught is not worth the AU$46 a case."
Worst,Corona Extra,3,"What can I write that hasn't been written or said of this beer. The highest selling Mexican beer in the World. The greatest marketing of Mexican Beers. It is the introduction of most to Mexican beers. At 4.6% abv, simply inoffensive. It's only commandment- Thou shall pair it with lime. Reminds everyone of the beach. If there's a category of girl friendly "" chick-beer"", - this is it. Corona's downside, or greatest marketing, is the clear glass because the longer in the shelf the worst it taste. Beer is so light and inoffensive you can drink it at church or a funeral and people wouldn't mind."
Worst,Corona Extra,3.19,"I mean, it’s a Corona—not bad on a hot day with a lime and some Mexican food. It tastes a bit skunked, but that’s what the lime is for ;). It is so easy to guzzle that twenty years ago as a college student I’d have six at a time. These days almost anyone’s local brewery probably makes a better Mexican lager, if that’s what you are in the mood for."
Worst,Corona Extra,3.84,"Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly fizzles away.

The aroma is slightly sweet, green apple and corn with hints of flower and grass.

The taste is pretty much the same as the nose. Green apple skins, grainy, lightly sweet, hints of corn, a little bit of white flowers and grass on the back end. Zero bitterness. Finishes as crisp as the aforementioned apple.

Mouthfeel is...fine? Light but not watery. Fizzy. Drinks like a pretty typical carbonated beverage. Super crisp and clean, though. Almost nothing is residual.

Wow. I was surprised by how much I liked this, at least from this format. A skunky bottle might have given me a more negative impression. This is a solid, refreshing corn lager. If you go in thirsty with no aloft expectations, you'll probably enjoy it, too!"
Worst,Corona Extra,3.38,"consumed straight from the 12oz clear glass bottle. typical cheap, easy drinking lager smell and taste. nothing fancy but i think that’s the idea here. i can kind of see why they add a lime to this beer as it helps offset the somewhat “cheaper” beer flavor with some citrusy zest. decent mouthfeel though. it’s got some bubbly carbonation and crispness to it. it’s not a half bad thirst quencher on a hot day. personally, i’d take modelo or pacifico over this."
Worst,Corona Extra,2.79,"Poured into a pils glass from a 24oz can best by December 2022

On the pour a decent head forms then immediately dissipates entirely. Body is a golden yellow with average carbonation, crystal clear.

Aroma is skunked, even in the can. I wonder if getting the beer lightstruck is part of the process. It still has some detectable not ruined hops but even so there is some cheap lager aroma here as well. Not bad but not great. Some vague sweet malts are detectable under everything else going on.

Flavor is quite similar to the smell, but with less lager flavor although retaining the skunkiness. Some hop bitterness is there but the skunk is present the whole time. A corny light and sweet malt finish does come eventually after a weird tartness subsides, no wonder people drink this with lime.

Feel is easy drinking crisp and very highly carbonated. Quite light but has a surprisingly long finish that is actually pleasant.

Overall this is a pretty flavorful lawnmower beer that still feels light. Hops are present unlike a lot of beers in the category but there's also a lot off about it. Nothing disgusting as I think a lot of it is intentional but I've had better."
Worst,Corona Extra,2.56,"Bottle poured in a Pilsener glass clear yellow liquid with numerous active carbonation streams . Produces a frothy two finger white head , settles to a thick layer , clinging lacings , looks good

Aroma is adjuncts and malt

Taste is water flavored beer

Light mouthfeel , I can see how these get guzzled

What starts off looking pleasing and appealing quickly subsides when you taste it. There just isn’t much, if any, taste.

Pass"
Worst,Corona Extra,1,"Worst beer ever. Bottle lets in light, cheap label, cheap beer. Adding salt and lime is just stupid. Only dumb college kids would do something so moronic. This is an embarrassment to all beers. This beer is far worse than anything listed on the worst rated page. I would not even cook with this beer. Plus, you are supporting a country that enables human trafficking and drug trafficking."
Worst,Corona Extra,3.51,"2022-06-15
24oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. BB DEC 2022.

Pours very clear pale yellow, an initial flash of moderately coarse head that disappears to almost nothing except for a few straggling tiny clusters of bubbles. Moderate amount of active carbonation. Smell is yeasty funk, grain, maybe corn, slight grassy spiciness.

Taste is fairly mild, but dominated by the yeasty funk. Grassiness follows, then maybe a little grainy sweetness. A surprising bitterness builds, and I get a little lemon zest.

Mouthfeel is super light and clean. Overall, it is what it is -- it's not bad, it's not going to turn any heads, but you could drink a few of these on a hot day."
Worst,Corona Extra,2.63,"I don't find this a horrible beer. It's just not that good either. Someone stated that if you don't add a lime, you're doing it wrong. My feeling is that if a beer needs citrus fruit to be drinkable, they are brewing it wrong. Most of the popularity of this beer is a good PR campaign. Keep in mind that this beer is popular in a country that bought pet rocks."
Worst,Corona Extra,2.5,"This is the epitome of an average beer. It is just fine by definition. Add a slice of lime to make it more tolerable but in a pinch, a corona is not the worst thing out there."
Worst,Corona Extra,2.83,"This beer is so average, until you put a lime in it. Something about this beer in a lime with it makes it phenomenal, cant really tell you why. This is an amazing beer with a lime, super refreshing"
Worst,Corona Extra,2.52,"I would never purchase this outside of accompanying my meal at a Mexican restaurant, but it does indeed serve that purpose. IMO it's only purpose. MUCH prefer a Modelo Negro if available."
Worst,Corona Extra,5,Great beer highly drinkable ... beware if you get skunky ones ... make sure to buy in the 12 pack box .. dont allow alot of light to hit it ... they become skunky when the hops go bad with light ... should be smooth tasting with no skunk flavor.
Worst,Busch NA,1.5,"I like it because it has virtually no taste or smell, but helps me to replace good real local craft beer when the doctor says I need to give the liver a rest. Good for carrying the tart cherry concentrate to help with that too."
Worst,Busch NA,4.01,Busch is a shitty beer. I've stopped drinking exclusively non-alcoholic beers. This is a great way to enjoy cheap beer with the guys in the garage when we're working on cars without feeling left out. Sometimes a cheap beer is exactly what you're looking for.
Worst,Busch NA,2.46,"Not as bad as its more expensive unkle dad boi Bud Zero. But still lacking in the feelz department. It’s decently carbed, but tastes like suckin on a thick can of pennies. Kinda how reg pbr does. Cheap tho!"
Worst,Busch NA,1.39,"Purchased as a single can from the local drive-thru for $.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Pale straw with a quick-to-disappear one-finger linen head.
S - Corn, wet hay. Slight grassiness.
T - Corn flakes, matzo bread. Underlying sweetness. Mild grass finish.
F - Medium carbonation. Crisp and clean finish. Very light body.
O - A low alcohol content does not always a terrible beer make. Unfortunately, this is a pretty bad brew. I have yet to have a normal Busch, but the bar is set pretty low here. Reminds me of a Miller Lite. Will not purchase again, and I highly recommend staying away from this one."
Worst,Busch NA,3,"For what it is not that bad. Has nice carbonation. Malty taste, nothing on bitterness but refreshing and zesty. This is a great alternative when alcohol is not an option. Cheap too, just like the real thing."
Worst,Busch NA,1.54,"Busch NA is a very transparent very pale straw with a short lasting foamy head. It smells of corn and something of crackers. The taste is corny and the sweetness, while not too strong, is unbalanced. The aftertaste is an unpleasant corn taste. The feel is very watery with some bubbles. Overall, it is Busch without alcohol."
Worst,Busch NA,2.38,"I have been drinking NA beers for 2 months now due to reasons beyond my control. This one is not great, but unlike 75% of the ones I have tried so far, is not offensive. Tastes like a watered down macro. Does not have the wort flavor or the off flavors of many other NAs. And, the price is right.
Let's face it, no one drinks NA beer because they prefer it to the real versions. This one is not disgusting, which puts it in the upper 25%."
Worst,Busch NA,2.88,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by corn. Taste is also corn heavy, some malts are present. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall it's not bad if you enjoy liquified corn, but otherwise is a below average example of this style."
Worst,Busch NA,3.89,"I can no longer find this product locally. This NA beer blew me away the first time I tried it. The reason was it was the lowest price NA beer on the shelf, and the taste was very acceptable. Then I couldn’t find it for a while, and once it came back, the taste was noticeably more watery. Do you think they could have changed the recipe ? It was still OK, but now it has disappeared again."
Worst,Busch NA,2.5,"Not actually all that bad. Actually a fair tasting beer. I would not drink it on a consistent basis, but I could see some times where high volume drinking is required, this might warrant consideration."
Worst,Busch NA,3.35,"I'm rating this compared to the arsenal of crappy mass produced American beer. Which I almost never drink. But in the defense of Bush NA, this tastes every bit like a Miller Light. I really can't taste the difference. If you are a Miller Light fan and want to not get drunk, I think you'd rate this beer a 5. Seriously. It tastes better than Busch Light.

Maybe there should be an NA section on Beer Advocate where we rate NAs next to their alcohol equivalent. Then this is hands down a 5.

If you like mediocre imported beer, then go for a Heineken 0.0. I can't tell the difference between that and it's alcohol counterpart. That's also a 5 on the NA scale"
Worst,Busch NA,4,"Looks, smells and tastes like a normal Busch beer. The head goes away in seconds and is very little if any lacing but it tastes exactly like an AAL with booze to me. So if you were drinking a 12 pack of busch light daily and liked the taste this would be perfect for cutting back on alcohol intake that's why I have to rate it so high. Does its job no more no less"
Worst,Busch NA,1.87,"12oz canned 37 days ago poured into a vintage Busch straight sided pokal at fridge temp (less than 0.5% ABV per can). The beer pours bright golden straw yellow with above average (for an AAL) nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin island. Aroma is virtually nonexistent. Only a hint of ""beer"" smell. Taste is fairly nuetral at first with a huge corny buttery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, well carbonated and ruined by the unchecked vegetable oil finish. Overall, poor. I will rate as a non alcoholic beer, but I believe this to be bad even for the style."
Worst,Busch NA,3.5,I have tasted a few non alcoholic brews and this one most closely resembled a real beer. tastes like regular Busch Beer. I could actually unwind on Friday night with a 6 pack of this and not worry about feeling like crap the next day if I had to get up early and go to work.
Worst,Busch NA,1.08,"Comparing only NA beers, BUD Light and Miller Lite, not my favorite Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.
Color was straw, actually better than Bud Light!
Aroma was sweet off a three finger head, lots of carbonation
Seltzer taste and feel like Bud Light
I'm assuming it's made from rice since I detected no barley or hops flavor.
Seltzer water is cheaper and I can ad my own hops!!!! I won't be trying this beer again unless major changes are made."
Worst,Busch NA,1.99,"Is this fair?: Rating a non-alcoholic Anheuser-Busch beverage. The bar starts low. That's to the product's benefit. A friend asked me to try this, so here I am. And besides, maybe I want to go NA sometimes.

Look: It might be the lighting in the room, but this beer isn't as watery-looking as I expected. Again, the bar is set low. It actually has a light golden color. The head disappears within a minute and, of course and some tiny bubbles are steadily working their way to the top. - 3.0

Smell: Ahh, that Anheuser-Busch aroma. It portends bad flavors approaching the palate. I've smelled worse, so I'm going with 2.0.

Taste: With the bar set so low, I'm struck by the fact that it isn't the worst beer I've had. I'm trying to envision a scenario where I would like this. It would have to involve a hot day, thirst and some sweaty work. Then again, I'd probably be looking for some alcohol. But not if I were operating a chainsaw on a hot day. Let's go with that. Under such circumstances, I might be grateful enough to rate this beer 2.0. Right now, the sharp taste of straw and overall underwhelming flavor move it more to a 1.75. To its credit, it doesn't hold much of an aftertaste.

Feel: Thin, light, slightly effervescent. That's kind of what you'd expect from a beer of this nature. For what it is, I'm going with 2.25.

Overall: Not as bad as I thought. If I needed a non-alcoholic beer, this was all I had, and it was very hot, then I'd take it. A rating of 2.0 isn't as bad as it could be. But you don't put high demands on a beer like this."
Worst,Busch NA,2.34,"Poured out of 12 oz can which is the only packaging I've ever seen it in.
Half a finger carbonated head that died down extremely fast with some lacing.
Smelled extremely weak, hardly anything there except piss-like grains. Maybe some corn?
Tasted worse than it smelled. Tasted weak and almost like water, but really really flat and maybe some really light barley malt and corn.
Mouthful was smooth but really flat, despite it looking really carbonated. Bad.
Overall, less pleasant experience the second time around. I'll take on O'Doul's over this."
Worst,Busch NA,4.25,"Busch NA - Anheuser-Busch. Poured from the can into a pint glass, this brew's head is 1 finger thick, lateral lacing, and a clear medium amber body.

I smell basically the same aroma that I would with regular ""BOOOOSCH"", but milder.

This also pretty much tastes just like a normal ABV Busch, just watered down with sorghum wheat.

The mouthfeel here is clean and smooth.

Overall, I'll give Busch NA - Anheuser-Busch a 4.25."
Worst,Busch NA,1.53,"Found this...yes, FOUND THIS in the garage of my recently desceased grandfather. Guy drank for fourty years and I see he left me a gift. Thanks big guy!.

Look - Crystal clear straw golden with a big ole bone white frothy head that you would expect from the regular Busch beer. Carbonation is pretty dead at this point. Lacing does no remain in any way.

Smell - Nothing really. Upon a hard whiff I get just a hint of distant usual suspected corn adjunct.

Taste - Pretty much follows the smell. Lighty corn adjunct and then seltzer water.

Feel - Just like water. Not even a trace of carbonation. Swallows easy and inoffensive.

Overall - What's the point."
Worst,Busch NA,2.1,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has slight malt hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent beer"
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.95,"Canned in a big old tallboy crafty craft can and purchased from the local minimart on petersfield avenue
Aroma is golden syrup
Flavour is slightly dry with some maple"
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.06,"Drinking this from a can, can't comment on the look.

Smell is pretty non-existant to my nose, little bit of fruit/ lemon. Not bad, not great.

Taste is syrupy and sweet, with more lemon-y flavours and a bitterness that creeps up as you swallow. Not really complex, but not terrible. No sight of those ""Finest German Aromatic Hops"" though, more just bitterness without flavour. Honestly, I don't hate it. Could be more complex or backed up with hops but besides being a bit cloyingly sweet it really is not bad.

Mouth feel is syrupy, kind of thick because of the sweetness. Not dry, although there is bitterness which develops on the finish.

Overall - I don't hate it like a lot of people on here. Is it excellent, highbrow beer? No. But for what it is, it honestly isn't terrible. Not too much liquor forward in my opinion, tastes strong but not 10%. I would like some more hops and flavour besides the sweetness, some orange or grapefruit would balance that... Not great, but not terrible. If you want a buzz for cheap, go for it. And it's better than the average American piss-in-a-can any day."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,4.33,"Love the nose on opening, taste was quite what I expected. So many haters, perhaps they are ""light"" beer drinkers. Due to the high alcohol content, I won't be drinking it often, however I will pick up the odd can in future. Love a malt forward beer."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,1,"The reviews of this beer are hilarious! I can't add much. Crest Super is pretty awful stuff! This is why it's not a good idea to produce a high alcohol lager. EKU-28 comes to mind. Syrupy, cloying flavors! And not good flavors! I have found that cutting this with half water makes it drinkable. I have this around in case I run out of ale that I brew. It gets things started quickly, if you know what I mean. It's basically a malt liquor for white people. Attention commercial brewers: It is much easier and less expensive to brew a high alcohol ale that tastes great than to attempt the same with a lager. Why are you not pursuing this? There is a market for a wonderful, high alcohol ale...in a CAN!!! Do it!!! Still, I would probably keep this around for emergencies. Just add water for drinkability."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.27,"500ml can, a sort of surprise new offering from the Wells & Young's group to suddenly show up here in Alberta (for the second time, it would appear!). The ‘finest German aroma hops’, eh? WTF? Was this actually made in the country that originated the English language?

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden amber colour, with two chubby fingers of puffy, rocky, and bubbly eggshell white head, which leaves some splendid bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it quickly abates.

It smells of sickly sweet apples and pears, gritty caramel malt, yeasty rising bread, lemon furniture polish, and some strangely stanky, um, strange (ok, hops, I suppose, but man are they musky). The taste is gritty and grainy caramel, well, ‘flavouring’, dead yeast cells, pome fruit-heavy Yuk-a-Flux, further near gag-inducing industrial alcohol warming notes, and a distinct lack of the finest of German hops never to be seen in a shit show like this.

The bubbles are quite underwhelming in their barely perceptible frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, as if buoyed by some unfamiliar sugar source, and not really all that smooth, not with that pithy, cheap-ass booziness loafing about. It finishes still pretty sweet, but all tainted here, and musty and dead-seeming there. Gah.

Yeah, this is not a craft brew, by any stretch of the imagination, which is a bit of a shame, given the predilections of the parent brewing concern (Courage, Bombardier, etc), but it is a party-starter (or ender, depending on one's constitution, I presume) - Euro malt liquor swill, incarnate. Oh, and I have to apologize for my opening generalizing tirade about the English - we have shitty, supposedly educated marketing people over here too."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,2.05,"Well it's fairly rank stuff. But lets be honest. You buy this to get a buzz on the cheap. I've been there, and I will say you could do worse. Alcohol is omnipresent in this one, yet it remains drinkable. Not really worth further elaboration but if your buying this and expecting exceptional taste, aroma or profiles your doing it wrong :D"
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.98,"500 mL can picked up at TBS; best before June 19 2016 and served ice cold. This is a beer that I have intentionally avoided for nearly 10 years now, but I was feeling masochistic tonight.

Pours a clear golden colour, capped off with one inch of frothy white head. It seeps away steadily over the next five minutes or so, eventually thinning out into a foamy cap and collar. Good lacing, too - visually this is a rather attractive lager, but aromatically I'd have to argue otherwise. Corn syrup, alcohol, wet cardboard, boiled vegetables and apples all come to mind, but ""quality lager"" most certainly does not. To quote a certain fictitious news anchor, I immediately regret this decision.

Not quite as awful as I'd anticipated, but still one of the worst beers I've had in years. Very saccharine, with flavours of corn syrup and cotton candy dominating at first. This is, surprisingly enough, countered by some weedy, grassy hop extract bitterness, but the truly off-putting aftertaste totally blots out that faint beam of light. Little effort has gone into masking the alcohol content, which is noticeable throughout the sip - but it really reaches its climax after you swallow a gulp. At that point, this beer begins to taste the way that compost water and paint thinner smell. Light-medium in body, with appropriately assertive carbonation levels. The alcohol burn is so significant that it almost seems to have a numbing effect on the tongue.

Final Grade: 1.98, a miserable F. Crest Super Premium Lager is more of a fraternity hazing supply or a solvent than a beer. In fact, it is easily one of the worst alcoholic beverages that I can recall consuming over the past decade - and consume I did, all the way to the bottom of the can, because I'm just that stubborn. Crest is shamelessly boozy, and I would judge no man or woman for pouring this swill down the drain. If you are drinking this simply to get drunk (and really, why else would you be?), prove that you have more self respect than me and buy yourself a mickey of whiskey or rum or something."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.02,"non drinkin bud light morons rate this beer low- so be it.

O- This beer opened up and became rubbing alcohol infused lager. Drain pour."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,3.36,"Obtained from a local 'Bargin Booze' outlet, just for joke: I was determinded to dislike it and had a bias preconception formed from trying other high alcohol canned lagers in the UK.

However, I liked the damn thing!

Wonderfully sunny day, and I was knackered after grafting all week: sat in the back garden I remembered this beer and thought I'd give it a go. Poured into Budweiser Budvar stemmed tulip.

Lovely snow white head on top of a crystal clear golden, bright lager. Looked almost identical to the wifes Carlsberg Export, except the Carlsberg had next to no head.

Alcohol esters in an otherwise odourless lager/pilsner type non-smell, I give a score of 3 for smell-less lagers/pilsners.

The actual taste reminded me of a Brigand Belgian Ale, with the alcohol being a little more prominent in this beer.

I also expected a nasty metalic headache type feel to the aftertaste, this didn't happen and I was pleasantly suprised by the beer in general. Sure it had too much alcohol for my tastes, but it told me that on the tin. This a lot better than many in this class or style, honest."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.06,"I imagine few people that drink Crest see the poorly bubbled, clear (but tarnished) golden liquid that lies beyond the steely, navy blue walls of the can (or the brown of the paper bag, for that matter). Should they, however, they won't note anything too different; while it may look pedestrian, and give no indication of the fact that it's the worst beer I've tried, it's definitely something I'd suggest the city's sanitation committee have a look at.

Crest smells like a cesspool of festering corn and alcohol fumes; the first thing that came to mind was a biological contamination site. I'm confused that they've used both hops and hop extract - ain't nothing standing in the way of this repulsive, excessive, cloying, synthetic sweetness. Then again, they also used both corn and corn syrup.

'Oh dear mother of God' - was what came out of my mouth after taking the first sip. The second thing was a fit of dry heaves. It's like they took stale corn kernels, coated them in corn syrup and drenched them in sugar. By the fourth sip it starts to feel like an Inquisition-type form of punishment. There's no way I'll make it through the whole can.

Anything with this much flagrant alcohol can easily upset even those with a cast iron stomach; warm discount-brand vodka is less offensive. 500ml can? Seriously? I could do a shot or two, max, if forced to. It has enough strong, synthetic, fusel quality to strip rust; kidding aside, it could honestly be confused with some of the products under your sink.

I not only appreciate all styles of beer, but genuinely like each and every one of them as well... with the exception of value-brand so-called malt-liquors which, as Crest Super confirms, I'm not too modest to admit, I believe are beneath me. I'm proud to say that I've tried very, very few malt-liquors, but Crest is far and away the most horrible.

Crest Super is super disgusting. The feeling of revulsion actually drinking it far, far exceeds the feeling of embarrassment I had buying the can. Beginning this review I had every intention of poking fun at the destitute, down-and-out types that make up Crest's only demographic - now I just feel sorry for them. In all seriousness, this beer - for all its flagrant, stomach-wrenching alcohol - is actually a very sobering experience."
Worst,Crest Super Premium Lager,1.45,"500 ml poured in a chilled pint glass...

Appearance - Crest pours very light with a white foamy head. Carbonation is fairly good, u can really hear it when you pour. The head is minimal and leads to some ok lacing. Colour is a light gold and very clean.

Smell - for a 10% beer you cant really smell the alcohol, the hops and a sweetness smell come through quite well.

Taste - UGGGG - one of the worse things i have ever put in my mouth! What a taste, there are no words that can over come the bitterness of this beer. I did not enjoy this beer a lick, kind of not looking fwd to the mouthfeel. If there was a 0.0 rating i would give it!

Mouthfeel - At this stage of the review, i am almost in tears cause its so bad. The mouthfeel has barring on the overall bitterness, i had a hard time keeping it my mouth for the duration of the tasting.

Drinkability - Please take not of all the reviews before u go spending your hard earned dollar on this beer. One i wont finish nor will i ever buy again..."
Worst,Budweiser,2.94,"Budweiser is a solid American lager. For what it is - a crisp, light, simple beer, it’s excellent. The consistency of their production is obviously incredible, and in the right setting (a hot summer day, or in the evening in a buzzing pub while watching the game) there are few things that can stand up to this classic. It’s best enjoyed cold and fresh, with its natural carbonation and mild beechwood finish and glorious light gold color and mild head. Folks complaining that it’s not like their good ol’ German beer or hazy mega-juice buttsmacker IPA aren’t wrong that it’s not a beer with a heavy body or distinct taste palate. But that’s missing the point of this beer completely. I’ve always got a fresh pack in the garage fridge."
Worst,Budweiser,1.6,"I found a bottle of Budweiser in somebody's refrigerator.
Look: Budweiser had significant foam from what I could see.
Smell: Budwieser had the hazy pungent aroma of corn mixed with industrial chemicals.
Taste: Budweiser had a sweet corn flavour with heavy hints of industrial chemicals. There was a mysterious bitterness within the aftertaste of the Budweiser I drank.
Feel: After I drank the Budweiser, I felt like I was drinking industrial chemicals mixed into a corn flavoured soda. I got scared that I would have a tummy ache.
Overall: I cannot recommend Budweiser to anybody."
Worst,Budweiser,2.2,"It really shows just how bad Americans taste is when Budweiser is one of the top selling beers in the country. Compare Budweiser with those from Canada, Germany, and Ireland, just to name a few, and Budweiser doesn't hold a candle to them.
Budweiser is a really, really sad commentary of a lager. That's why I drink German beer."
Worst,Budweiser,2.92,"Pours a very clear and pale yellow color with a white head. It has the taste of a decent beer when you drink one ice cold and paired with food like pizza, burgers, and Bar-B-Q. Haven't had one in a couple of years, but I still like it."
Worst,Budweiser,4.33,"Budweiser goes good with almost any food, tacos, hamburgers, hotdogs, and is a good beverage to drink while hanging out with friends and watching sports."
Worst,Budweiser,4.78,"Just a good and inexpensive traditional American lager that the snobs hate but everyone drinks and likes.
Its consistent and refreshing on hot summer day."
Worst,Budweiser,1.59,"Last beer I reviewed was an exquisite, delicate Pilsner that paired insanely well with a good pizza. The boys over at Weihenstephaner sure know how to do the right balance of complex and nuanced flavors, along with a nice delicate, simple beer that is worthy of their brand.

With my reviews, I've mostly been doing beers I love or like, so my reviews are skewed in that way, but today I review a beer that I feel isn't all that great, and that's Anheuser-Busch's beer, Budweiser.

COLOR:

Light and clear golden color. It does look pretty good when poured right. The head fizzles out and dies though, which should be an indication of what I should expect.

AROMA:

Smells tart and cheap. I got a weird, funky skunk smell. Just smells bad.

BODY AND PALATE:

It has the memory of a lager. All of the classic flavors are there, they're just incredibly thinned out. This tastes as if you wanted a beer and somebody shouted the classic lager flavor profile from another room. It tastes cheap.

Add some corn syrup taste and feel to this and you basically have a Budweiser. I love me a good Pilsner and a nice, refreshing lager, but this is definitely not the King of the Beers. More like a serf.

FINISH:

The finish isn't too bad, and not out of the ordinary for a typical lager finish. And I guess that's sorta the problem, isn't it? Nothing really stands out and intrigues your palate.

CONCLUSION:

This is nothing but dorm room beer. It's cheap, it's readily available, and for playing drinking games it has its place. But now that I'm 32 years old, I'm not after quantity, I want a nice, quality beer, and this beer just tastes like water to me.

This beer basically took those classic and delicate flavors of pale lagers and Pilsners that people love, and thinned them out, because they're after mass production and not a nice, refreshing, quality beer at the end of the day.

Overall, it gets a 2.5/10 for me. It tastes like the MEMORY of a lager or Pilsner, and is only good if you've just reached drinking age, you don't have a lot of money, and all you give a shit about is getting shit-hammered."
Worst,Budweiser,4.35,"""Best by 10/6/22""; drank 7/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice off-white head; strong, frothy lace.

Sweet corn, fresh bread & faint strawberry (?!) notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, mild raspberry & faint caramel flavors.

I'm stunned by how much I enjoyed this; my beer budget is about to plummet!!"
Worst,Budweiser,3.43,"It’s hot dogs and brats on the grill, fireworks and a Bud!

I assume I’ve had a Bud before, but the last time was at least 40 years ago (probably longer). And I have no specific memory of it amongst a sea of similar beers.

The 4th of July seemed to me to be as good a time as any to give it a proper tasting.

I reduced the temp of my smaller beer ‘fridge specifically for this beer. The ‘fridge was at about 38°F when I removed the beer. The beer was at about 40° when I started tasting.

Clear, pale yellow, lightly carbonated body topped with a tall white head, thick and creamy-looking with retention on the short side of moderate. Nice looking for the style.

Pleasant, if weak, aroma. Malty with hints of sweetness. No complexity, but still nice.

Light flavor of malts. Smooth in the beginning, and remaining such throughout. Some (but very little) bittering appears in the late middle and carries through to the finish. As with the aroma, no complexity, but still enjoyable. The aftertaste is mild and lightly malty with slight bittering. The overall taste is just a little on the sweet side. The finish and aftertaste are more malty than crisp, ending, again, just on the sweet side. (The slight sweetness of Budweiser is apparently one of the differentiating factors – according to other reviews – from the other top-selling AALs, but I like it.)

The mouth feel is thin, decent carbonation feel, and surprisingly creamy (in a light sort of way).

Overall, I am surprised that I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In flavor and in body, it certainly beats the heck out of the plethora of light/Lite® brands from these macro brewers.

One additional comment: unlike some other macro lagers – and even some non-macro lighter lagers, this beer does not develop off-flavors as it warms. It remains pretty much as it started.

NB: The following rating is with style in mind, but it also is a fair reflection of my enjoyment of this beer. Imagine that. I think I'll crack a second!"
Worst,Budweiser,3.74,"Bud was the very first beer my friend gave me, years ago. It was warm and probably past it’s expiration. I didn’t even finish it before throwing up. Didn’t drink beer again for over a decade and a half. Now I know what I like and enjoy exploring different beers and saw the tall-boy cans of Budweiser for sale on the 4th of July with the word “FREEDOM” inscribed on the front. I decided I should revisit this for the sake of knowing what it actually tastes like. Surprise! -it’s not as horrible as the beer aficionados claim. Neutral flavor of very mild hops, malt, and sweetness from the rice. No off-putting flavors or aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. It’s not something that one drinks to contemplate life’s mysteries, but maybe just to stare into a camp fire or watch the stars. It’s good enough to cool you from the heat of your bbq grill. I will say that I had some *ahem* bathroom problems later that I can’t help but attribute to this beer… but overall I cannot bring myself to look down on Budweiser any longer."
Worst,Budweiser,5,"Picked up a case of bud cans today. Maybe it’s the special summer “freedom” marketing that gets me, I don’t know. This beer pours perfectly, golden with a glorious white head. Smell and taste are slightly crisp like green apple cider, not too heavy, not too sweet. It goes down smooth and I actively want to chug it. This is a Beer I long ago dismissed but now I think I might just be a bud man like my father was."
Worst,Budweiser,3.14,"I just had to write this.I am an IPA fanboy who hits all the taprooms around the city.I hopped on BeerAdvocate to read up on Budweiset.
I tried a Budweiser tallboy because 5% abv around a pool in the summer makes more sense than my 7.2% IPA.
It ain't that bad,geekheads.And you should know that because we ALL drank Bud at some point of our lives.It's not your local's pilsener/lager that costs twice as much,but it is a decent brewski for sitting with friends.And for all of you reviewers that keep talking about corn this and corn that...Bud uses rice,not corn, as the adjunct,so shut up already.I can't drink Busch because of that corn;Bud doesn't have that problem.
Bud has a neutral,but pleasant taste.Doesn't smell like much of anything.Goes down smooth and easy.
I prefer IPAs,but I am not ashamed to drink this.And neither should you be."
Worst,Budweiser,3,Budweiser is fine not the best of brews but it’s decent. I prefer ipas but Budweiser is okay I won’t drink it regularly but it does have its place
Worst,Budweiser,4.91,"Waaaaaaaaay too many beer snobs in here like they are reviewing a fine French wine. It's beer ffs. Get over yourselves. I ascribe to the German proverb that there are no bad beers....some are just better than others. I drink very high end stuff, and then I drink this. Beer Advocate peeps are obviously partial to IPAs. That's cool..I like them too, but I really get sick of them too and want something simple like Bud or a Naragansset. I don't know why I bother reading the reviews on here. Very predictable. If there were blind taste tests, the reviews would be different. Drink what you like. Cheers!"
Worst,Budweiser,2.65,"Poured from a 16oz can into my weizen glass. Best before 5-14-22

On the pour a giant head forms even on an average pour 3 plus fingers but it quickly recedes to just a ring of larger bubbles around the rim and a few pods of bubbles floating on top

Aroma is tart and largely smells of cheap lager. Some BO notes not great and not a lot of malt either just off. And this is still a month before the best before. Bad.

Taste follows the smell but brings notes of corn. Still mostly tart water fermentation character. Some buscuity malt aftertaste but that fades to the taste of popcorn kernels. No bitterness, just fermentation, BO and grain. Still not a lot of flavor though.

Feel is crisp and easy to put down with a lot of carbonation bite for the style this is perfectly acceptable. Not overly watery on the sip but it doesn't stick around long. Not the best.

Overall perfectly drinkable and pretty predictable. Seems like it moves quick everywhere so it's not too risky if you can deal with the standard off flavors. Certainly not a standout, and I wouldn't reccomend pouring this in a glass."
Worst,Budweiser,2.49,"Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.

Syrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.

I am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.

So, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!"
Worst,Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,1.46,"The beer looked typical for an AAL, and had the expected thin, watery mouthfeel. Other wise, it smelled bad, tasted bad, was unenjoyable, and an overall bad beer."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,2.56,"Like the hippies of yore, I will try anything once.

The fizziness of both the pour and the head reminded me of soda pop. Color was a light, pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. I have micturated darker than this! Nose was peachy all right, but I do not know what the dragon fruit was supposed to add to the equation. Mouthfeel was thin and watery and the flavor reminded me of peach ice cream. Finish was semi-sweet, kind of refreshing on a humid day. This was an interesting curiosity for me and not much more. It was better than some of the bland nothings that I have tried in this line and the fact that it was refreshing was a bonus."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,3.09,"From the 12 fl. oz. twist-off with a marking of 1167-2910629A. Sampled on March 9, 2013.

Remember to rate it on style not on reputation.

It poured pale yellow with a quick excited burst of fizzy carbonation leading to a head that fizzles quickly. So place it at average.

The aroma is full of peach esters like announced but there is a vague bready and clean hop note lingering behind it all. So a little above average.

The body is light with a slight acidity probably due to the peach zing. So a tad above average.

The taste is peached up to the max at first but there is an odd sort of lingering finish which could be due to the hops or the fruit. I will put it at average.

There are a bunch of these Michelob Ultra fruit beers out there and this one is slightly more appealing than the others I have had. But it is still a hot summer day kind of beer."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,3.41,"I picked up a bottle of this and shared with my wife, enjoyed chilled a goblet.

the color is pale golden with thin band of white beads and moderately fast moving carbonation. The smell is very sweet and peachy with a light tropical candy odor which I suppose is dragonfruit-esque but the aroma is more fuzzy navel smelling in general. Light feel, ultra light fizzy and seltzer-like.

The flavor is similar to the scent with some tangy fruitiness and sweet essence with mild tropical juice like cooler quality with mild spritzer-like taste in comparision to other fruit lagers I guess. Overall not terrible especially if you are rating it for what it is and not a simple light lager. I would probably not buy this but it certainly fits the label and was not dissapointing when paired with sushi and wasabi. I would say poor if you are looking for a true beer, but not bad if you want a malternative."
Worst,Boxer Lager,5,"Not to objective because it is my favorite lager and costs less than a buck for 24 ounces.

It has a cara-pils malt taste that harkens to the beers they made at that brewery since I started drinking. Some comments attribute it to yeast...which makes some sense because you couldn't afford expensive malt at that price.

Most younger ""serious"" beer drinkers are sucking down heavy hopped beers. If your looking for your beer to taste like high gravity bitters or grapefruit you will need to spend more money.

This beer is distinctive and produced in relatively tiny batches. At the price there is no comparison.

It reminds me a bit of beer from India."
Worst,Boxer Lager,3.74,"This is what happens when Millennial beer-snob, know-it-alls review a beer.

If this beer were twice as expensive and packaged differently, with maybe the silhouette of Muhammad Ali, or a sharp photograph of a boxing glove, the 30-somethings would be falling all over themselves.

As it is, this is a cheap, easily drinkable beer with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nutmeg, Hefeweizen taste.

Not my first choice. But an OK choice.

Is it a 'BudHead?' *( the tantalizing, wonderful, heavenly mix of two great North American loggers, Moosehead and Budweiser mixed in a 50/50 proportion? ) HELLS NO.

NOTHING IS.

( and if you're NOT thinking of going to the store and buying a sixer of each, both Moosehead and Budweiser, and trying it yourself in a tall dimpled or nonic glass, then you are simply a fool )

But, I digress. Boxer is a cheap, easy Buzz. Throw a lemon slice in and maybe once squeeze of honey and you've got yourself a terrific summer cooler. Even adding ice won't ruin things for you...."
Worst,Boxer Lager,3.61,"Poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage O'Doul's bow-tie glass. Stunningly clear golden color, with a finger or two of white head that settles rather rapidly. As AAL's go, this is pretty inoffensive. Boxer is light bodied, not too sweet, and mostly dry on the finish, with some light grain, grassy hops, and hints of tart apple on the nose and palate. Pretty typical. However, there is something else going on here: there are unmistakable notes of hefeweizen yeast, which contribute aromas and flavors of banana and clove. These notes are present in some other offerings from Minhas / Rhinelander as well. Is this a characteristic of their house yeast? I don't know. But those notes of banana and clove really give this a pleasant kick. (And you can't beat the price!)"

Worst,Boxer Lager,2.59,"Minhas Craft Brewery ""Boxer Lager""
12 fl. oz. can, production coded but without freshness dating
$6.99 / 15-pack case @ Javie's Beverage, Philadelphia, PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's clear but not as clear as I thought it would be, I can't see my finger prints through the glass, nor are my fingers really that clear. Odd. The initial finger-thick head of bright white that rose up over the fairly deep golden body is now already gone but there are some splashes of lacing left behind. The aroma is sweetish and dare I say malty? It's not grainy, and it's clear that there's some adjunct in use, but there is some maltiness to it. There's also, unfortunately, some esters that I connect with higher fermentation... not good. The flavor follows, and again, it's surprisingly malty, and sweetish like wort. I don't detect any specific oxidation like a papery characteristic, but it could be that some initial oxidation is making it seem more malty. Just a theory. It's medium bodied and crisp. I didn't find any hops in the aroma, nor do I find any in the flavor except for a touch of an herbal and leafy note in the finish. It's background though and that higher alcohol ester thing is still there and distracting. This is obviously not well made, but it's cheap - although there are many better made budget beers on the market that cost less. Disappointing.

Worst,Boxer Lager,2.87,"Poured from 24 oz. can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a very nice golden amber color with tons of tiny bubbles streaming up through the brew and producing a two finger head of white foam. The head has a modest level of retention, fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of sweeter smells of caramel and a decent showing of corn syrup. Along with these aromas comes a decent amount of a metallic smell.

Taste – The taste begins with a mix of a bready, light caramel, and corn cereal taste mixed with a bit of a metallic flavor. The metallic flavor gets stronger in nature as the taste advances all while the bready and the corn fade a bit. All the while a bit of a cardboard flavor develops and with a loss much of the caramel, one is left with a somewhat off metallic and cardboard corny taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of eh brew is on the slightly thicker side (for a 5 % adjunct lager) with a carbonation level that was average. A little thinner body may have been slightly better for the mix of caramel and corn upfront and may have downplayed some of the off flavors slightly better. Overall the feel was not all that bad though

Overall – Not the tastiest of brews, but for the cheap price it is actually a decent go too. A good party brew."
Worst,Boxer Lager,1.05,"A few days ago I thought I had a bad beer - HA! This is even worse than the world beers I've had from the world's poorest countries. Totally sweet beer water and nothing more.

Worst,Boxer Lager,4.61,"This is an excellent session beer. One of the best ever. It is complex with interesting notes of fresh hops, fruits and grain. It reminds me of premium German and/or Czech biers. Absolutely love it. My fridge is now full of Boxer and I have never had more friends."
Worst,Boxer Lager,2.32,"Initially wild look, with rampant carbonation and a small but lively head. Settles quite quickly. Clear golden appearance. Looks like a boring lager.

Strong carbonation with a lot of sweetness. Subtle notes of malt, but I was really looking for something to latch onto so that might just be Stockholm Syndrome. For the price, this is fine. But I prefer my light lagers to be less carbonated, even if I might be in the minority here."

Worst,Boxer Lager,3.1,"I bought this beer on impulse from the liquor store across the street, The price point was 2 for $1, this was a low risk high reward situation. I found this beer tasted rather inoffensive, by the time I downed the first beer the next thing I knew I was polishing off the next one."
Worst,Boxer Lager,1.36,"I, too, was lured in by the $13.40 for 36 cans price -- cheapest per fl. oz. I think I had ever seen. And I have no problem with a ""just get wasted"" beer, having glugged Schaefer and Schmidt in college -- though that was long ago and isn't the main purpose anymore. I don't drink to get bombed any longer. That said, when is this ""just get wasted"" beer going to give me so much as a buzz? Memorial Day Sunday, I think I could have chugged all 36 cans in rapid succession and not suffered so much as a mild-buzz headache. Water overloadl poisoning maybe. Was the 4.2% alcohol content before or after dumping the vat of water into the mix??? As for taste, can't comment on something that has none. If I wanted Aquafina, I would have bought it."
Worst,Boxer Lager,2.35,"If your aim is just to get wasted, this beer works fine (one of the cheapest beers you can buy where I live). Too sweet overall, but I'd probably take it over Budweiser..."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.04,"12 oz green bottle

clear golden color, foamy white head. mild sweet grainy aroma. taste is bland and watery. super thin bodied. not a bad flavor, just no flavor."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.45,"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a white foamy/creamy head. Smell is barely perceptible, very mild earth/grassy scent. Taste is mostly a clean malt profile with a somewhat weak hop bite. Feels well carbonated thin bodied. Mildly astringent. Finishes dry. Overall it is what it is- For a light lager it is as good as Amstel in my opinion, better than the macro brew light beers- Only 3.3 % ABV. After reviewing this Amstel and Heineken are both ""macro"" , I meant American macro breweries."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,1.22,"God awful nasty!
This beer has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
I'd rather drink mule piss.
Took 2 sips and drain poured it, poor drain. Sorry.
Probably should have flushed it instead.
Pale off clear with no head, sour/skunky/putrid smell.
Who drinks this crap and enjoys it.
At least have an Amstel Light.
Not much better, but ... Better."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.07,"So this is pretty ass, no two ways about it. They used to have that guy from that show that was also ass and the ad would be on all the time. They said it was like the best ranked light beer or something, but this is just Dutch River water scooped out of the Holland canals. Gross. First time I had this was at a billiards/ping pong kinda arcade bar on the second floor (my first mistake) in New Orleans like 5 years ago. It was piss then and I didn’t even really drink beer at the time. Now it’s plan undrinkable to me an frankly I love the regular Heineken. It’s a great lager with good crisp taste. This? This is flat, pungent skunk water. It’s Heineken but it’s like been run through the drink dispenser hose at the bar. Sorta kinda tastes like something you know to be orange juice but you know it’s sourced from concentrate. That’s this. Heineken that’s been watered down, run through a dirty fire hose and a skunk’s ass, then bottled. Steer clear my friends."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.31,"Green bottle into glass

This is waay better on-tap, but is decent out tha bottle, too. Cleaner and lighter than the OG but with about the same hops, which is a win in my book

An OK terrible beer"
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.87,"Poured from a can into a Sam Adams glass

L: Pours a crystal clear pale gold. White head fades to a ring of bubbles quickly.
S: Inoffensive euro lager without the skunk smell. The can really helps.
T: Like a crisper, cleaner Heineken. Watery, but it works.
F: Dry and effervescent.
O: Disagree with the awful rating. This is a 90 calorie beer with 3.3% ABV. Rate it for what it is. Really nice for after work or a session. If you buy this, make sure it’s in a can and not the green bottle."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.7,"I recently bought these vs. Buying them when they came out. ""Premium malt lager"" was this always? I won't say if these were good or bad but... bottles from 12 pack stayed in the fridge a long time."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,4.66,"I remember as a kid, my mom have a Heineken once in a blue. When I first tried it I thought it was disgusting. Strong. Too strong. As a woman now, I favor Heineken Lights. For over 7 years now its my go to. I remember having friends give me toilet beer like STEEL RESERVE. LORD help me. No, help them. I remember visiting this friend, I was drunk before noon. I knew my dear friend was REALLY having life issues. It was like drinking straight chemicals. I was the one who had to pick up our children...mines...his... hers...from school. Smelling like a damn can redemption. Damn embarrassing. I am a woman who does not like flavors in my beer. Like limes and lemons. Gross. I like whisky and Heineken Lights. This is my beer. Always. No hangover, no foamy gassy burps like Miller high life. This is just my fav. Even the dark Heineken is decent. I can chicken wings with my fav beer."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.13,"Appears light golden yellow almost clear.
Smells lightly grassy, light floral.
Taste follows the nose.
Mouth feel is light for the style.
Overall, as light beers go, not completely terrible.
But, generally I don't drink light beers.
So I probably wouldn't drink this again."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2,"Very dissapointing, I rate regular just a shade below average, but this one is poor, borderline terrible. Not just a light beer, it's like they poured half the completed batch out and replaced it with water. Clear golden color and a less than favorable hoppy aroma. The taste is of passed-it hops and water. Thin mouthfeel and a skunk Heineken aftertase. Not recommended"
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.14,"Has a very light clear color with minimal head. Smells slightly skunky but not strong. Tastes refreshing yet refined, nothing to go home about. Feels good on a hot day. Overall I was kind of surprised with this light beer, very easy to drink and not going to get you wasted."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.65,"Crystal clear, light golden colored body; tiny carbonation bubbles galore; head is decent if rather thin in the long run, white and dense; big patches of foam cling to the glass. Strong aroma of cereal grains; baked wheat and cracker; slightly herbal. The taste is wheat-forward; grainy; mild bitterness; a slight metallic flavor. Medium-light body; smooth and creamy; grain warmth; mainly dry finish.

This actually is a decent light beer, relatively flavorful with a nice body to it."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.07,"(22 oz bottle, best by SEP-2019, 3.3% abv; purchased cold from unlit fridge... poured into 28 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, slightly pale gold colored liquid; tight, frothy, fleeting off-white cap - foam looks like it would hold, but it settles into thin cap, then thin collar; only a little slits of lace

S: initial whiff of classic Heine' skank; mineral-y, dried flowers, grassy undertone, with an almost pizza crusty malt base under it all... something odd, something missing, as if the malt aromas have been drained of malt... fair intensity overall

T: extra dry, doughy, lightly-toasted, crackery grain in essence upon first sip (with a little more suds to carry the flavors)... first big sip reveals an underwhelming, brown-paper-bag dullness to the edges of the malt foundation... the dryness in its finish is rather dead-on ideal for its ilk; mute expression all-around, though it almost has a helles-like aftertaste creep in late

F: delicate sizzle with each sip; certain mellow plushness; light-bodied, but not thin... aside from a subtle residual chew on the palate, it doesn't feel much like beer has passed through

O: moreish this is not... one must be hurting to be reduced to drinking this regularly - but if you must, you must... drank about half the bottle only for purposes of well-rounded take; could take or leave the other half (left it) (1412)"
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,2.88,"16oz can poured into Duvel tulip. BBD FEB-2020 printed on bottom of can. So this still has up to 8 months of freshness left in it. Picked it up at the grocery store in a 4 pack for $6.

Appearance - Pours large offwhite semi-loose head with good retention, patchy lacing and decent to low stick. Crystal clear medium gold body. 4

Smell - The graininess you'd except from a euro lager, but a little fainter than normal. 3.5

Taste - Heineken plus water? Did I figure it out? Bland. But I mean, that's what you get what you're asking for. No real off characters. 2.5

Mouthfeel - Thin, watery, clean. I guess even refreshing, though without the effervescence you'd normally associate with that word. 2.5

Overall - It's damn near water, but again, you're getting exactly what you're asking for when you get a beer with the variation ""light"" slapped across the label. No real off characters to speak of. Probably good with pairing with delicate foods. About to try it with sushi. The best praise I can give it, is it's not overly bad. 2.75"
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.36,"There is nothing particularly wrong with this beer. I personally would probably prefer a regular Heineken though if I had to choose. Super light, but goes does incredibly smooth."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.5,"The nose brings citrus and grass to mind, while the malt profile is very hard to make out. The taste is very clean and inoffensive. While the attack distantly reminds of hay and grain, it is otherwise devoid of any malt character, and the center is formed by distant echoes of hops with just a faint hint of a shadow of bitterness, leading up to a mostly clean finish with a hint of grain. The body is lean and feels as though it has been diluted with water. There's nothing off with the brew, but it sure is bland."
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.72,"12 Oz bottle poured into glass
Look - similar to an adjunct lager, very clear, pale straw color, some foam and some glass lacing
Smell - aroma of various herbs and earth grains. Some sour, some bitter. Very unique yeast.
Taste - Extremely light, almost water-like and some flavor but nothing too crazy. Essentially tastes like a watered down Heineken. Lots of white bread and paleness. Carbonation is only medium which is good. Could probably drink this all night its so smooth and crisp and light.

Overall, if you are going to drink Heineken out of a bottle, make sure it has been packed well without any light access or you risky drinking skunk. If its not skunked i find it very enjoyable although this light version is too light for me on most occasions. I give it a grade of B"
Worst,Heineken Premium Light Lager,3.68,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/2/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.3%. Overall this is a nice light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Nicely flavorful and not watery for the ABV. No skunk at all surprisingly. Clean pils malts and nice earthy hop presence for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example. Probably the best macro light lager I've ever had!"
Worst,Pale Ale,3.88,Gluten Free Pales and IPAs are a struggle. These are not easy brews to make. This is one of the best I have had as it would be an pretty good beer if you did not know it was gluten free. Overall I believe they did a very good job on this brew.
Worst,Pale Ale,2.34,"Crystal clear color of light gold. Brief one-finger head. Absolutely zero lacing on the glass.

The smell is dry malt with a caramel touch. There's a bit of cardboard to the nose as well.

High carbonation level with not enough body to balance it. Despite this, this beer is too sweet, cloy even. There are overtones of apricot and caramel, but it isn't appealing--too dessert like. The hop is nearly nonexistent which is unfortunate since this beer needs balance. Think double bock without the body or rich malt presence. A clear miss."
Worst,Pale Ale,1,"If a 0 was possible, I would have given it such. This is easily one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. I had to actually pour it down the sink, and I think it worked better as a drain cleaner than a beer. Don't waste your money."
Worst,Pale Ale,1.4,"At least it looks nice...Taste is awful, among the worst beers I've tasted. Definitely the worst beer I've had considering the price-point. I don't know if I should be sad of the fact that I paid $8 for four of them, or if I should be happy that I only have three left."
Worst,Pale Ale,2.12,"Bottle label data: none.

A thick, rocky, white head sits atop a golden body while fine carbonation bubbles furiously rise to the top. An interesting aroma of pine, peppermint, and grass; pepper. Powerful, pungent taste like plastic and sour citrus; very bitter. Medium bodied; juicy and slick feel.

My god! How can a beer that looks, smells, and feels so decent have such an off-putting flavor? The flavor is nothing like a pale ale and instead presents an amped version of a bad mix of grapefruit and lime juice. Out of whack (taste-wise) and extremely forgettable unless you just want to look at it..."
Worst,Pale Ale,2,"Gluten-free beer....totally pointless. But I picked up a bottle anyway.

Poured into a handy teku glass, a darker amber color, with a thin bubbly white head that held as a small ringlet. Nose was mostly subdued, hints of herbal hops and sugary sweetness. In the taste, up front, there was a light flavor of herbal hops, like dried leaves, with a big wave of candy-like sweetness coming in soon after, and lingering into the aftertaste. Tasted more like beer-flavored seltzer. Mouthfeel was thin, body was light-medium.

Gluten sensitivity has pretty much been proven a myth except for the small amount of people with that disease/disorder, so there's really only a small number of people who would actually need a gluten-free beer. Hopefully there's one out there somewhere that tastes good to help out those people that actually want to enjoy the craft beer scene."
Worst,Pale Ale,2.63,"I had purchased this a while back, thinking that perhaps an article on gluten-free beers might be in the offing. When I could not find a taker, the beers got shunted to the side. I had a colleague who has issues with gluten and she was always curious about beers that were gluten-free. I usually eschew them since I am not gluten-intolerant and prefer to leave them for people who are. In the interim, I am purging my massive backlog of bottles this summer and lo and behold! this one popped up. They will now be part of The Great Bottle Purge of the Summer of 2014.

From the bottle: ""Ale made from sorghum and brown rice extract""; ""new Palnet Beer chooses to support organizations that help our planet.""

I am being driven nuts by these gluten-free beers! I realize that I am not their intended audience since I do not have Celiac, but they just make me feel like drinking a beer after I drink one. My easy-going pour still created a LOT of foam, so I sat back to let it do its thing. It burped, fizzled, off-gassed and generally acted like a baby, except that I have encountered better-behaved babies. It finally settled into a brief finger of rocky, tawny head that was determined to fizzle into wisps. Color was a tea-like deep amber/light copper to copper (SRM = &gt; 13, &lt; 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a flowery, perfume-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. There was no question that this beer contained sorghum once I got some in my mouth. Man, but it imparts a really sharp tartness that might appeal to some people, but for me, it was just not what I want to taste in a beer. I find it kind of difficult to describe, but it is like a diluted molasses with apple vinegar. Woof! Finish was dry, tart, not much unlike other gluten-free beers, but just not my bag."
Worst,Pale Ale,1.29,"This looks like a decent glass of beer with a slightly dark, coppery coloring and a decent head. That is where the positives end unfortunately. The taste is metallic, artificial and incredibly unlike how a beer should taste. It is also proceed like a premium beer which adds insult to injury. If I were gluten free I would gladly give up beer if this were my only choice. Fortunately there are others like Omission IPA that, while not fantastic, are palatable."
Worst,Modelo Light,2.13,I'd like this one much more if it had somewhere around 4% abv - at 2% abv it just isn't worth drinking... tastes like watered down corona light... which means it tastes like water with extra water
Worst,Modelo Light,1.9,"Appears very slightly yellow color with a foamy head that dropped quickly and no lacing.
Smells very lightly bready, corn, lightly floral.
Taste follows the nose.
Mouth feel is very keen light for the style, watery.
Overall, I don't like light beers, but if you do? You might like it.
I probably wouldn't order again."
Worst,Modelo Light,3.08,"A lot like regular only thinner, along with malts and a beery finish. Was expecting it to be very light but drinkable and that pretty much sums it up."
Worst,Modelo Light,2.12,"Straight from the bottle to wine glass very cold beer
Appearance: Light pale yellow, minimal head, a lot of lacing
Aroma: scent smell of malt, nothing else
Taste: not really great Mouth feel: very carbonated
Overall: good beer for the hot weather"
Worst,Modelo Light,1.63,"Watered down modelo especial... less flavor less calories less adepts. Modelo made this in response to Tecate Light, a very succesfull beer in Mexico, but it´s not even close in sales or fans."
Worst,Modelo Light,3.5,"Modelo Light has a fairly thick, off-white head, a clear, bubbly, golden appearance, and even a bit of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is a rich and sweet barley malt. Taste is of a biscuity, sweet, and even slightly syrupy malt. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Modelo Light finishes crisp, clean, and refreshing. One of the best light beers I’ve ever tried, and I pick up no adjuncts with it.

Worst,Black Label Beer,3.5,"This was definitely one of the beers that we consumed mass quantities of while we were in high school back in Cleveland, Ohio. I just hope that I gave this beer a decent rating from what I can remember about it besides the name."
Worst,Black Label Beer,1.15,"$4.99 Sixer at some random gas station in Toledo, Ohio. Never seen it but it waa priced alright and I am a member of the infamous "" gotta try 'em all club "". Well, Here goes!.

Look - Golden without a head. Woah never seen that in an AAL. Dead carbonation. Welp.

Smell - Rotten sweaty sock. Ahh must be a Canadian lager.

Taste - Solvent and sweat. Pesticide riddled corn. Mineral water on the back end was at least acceptable.

Feel - Sticky and the sweetness ascends to ridiculousness. Fusel alcohol. Makes no sense at the ABV. Swallow induces a gag.

Overall - I drink more AAL than any other style. And this shit is downright bad. I don't care what fond memory you had on your fishing trip where your grandpa was throwing this shit back before telling you stories about Nam. If you see somebody drinking this slop, have an intervention. Yuck."
Worst,Black Label Beer,3.35,"12oz cans stamped MAY 1319 poured into a hockey skate mug at fridge temp, no ABV indicated on can. The beer pours bright very light yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes to a single layer of bubbles and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is more corny and vegetable than anything. The taste is corny and wet, with a bit of tart. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and undry in the finish. There's a pronounced buttery/soapy aftertaste and feel that is not altogether inviting. Overall, not so good. This $8/12 pack takes me back to high school, but it will be a short visit."
Worst,Black Label Beer,2.35,"Do not believe it was brewed by Pabst when I had it. Even Pabst couldn't have dragged this one down. The lone highlight, if you will, is that the beer has some taste. Kind of sweet and malty.
Not poor, but only a notch above it."
Worst,Black Label Beer,3,"Pours a pale golden-straw in color, and as clear as can be.

Not much to go on in the nose or aroma segment. It’s inoffensive, neutral and “clean”, with malt character dominating the (very low in character, anyway) corn syrup. No hop presence whatsoever.

Light and somewhat crisp on the first sip. Sweetish. As with the nose, an inoffensive character, with little in the way of malt depth by which anyone might find interest or something to engage in, or even to recommend to another lover of characterful lager, real ale, or Craft Beer. Finish using the dry side, for what it’s worth.

“Boring and inoffensive” is not the sort of phrase I’d use to recommend a beer to anyone else, but in the right circumstances that’s exactly the sort of beer that’s called for, and Black Label fits the bill most of the time.

And it’s cheap, too! Well, a quarter or more higher in price than the lowliest of the low in the malt liquor category (211), but when you’re on a budget and want a brand to relax with but not get crunk on, this is a go-to — if you can even find it.*

Not recommended for people who have little sense of humor in an increasingly absurd world. For the fact is, with Taprooms opening on every block in every major city, it won’t be long before retailers will refuse to stock rubbish such as this, owing to the fact that there’s so much local Craft Beer in cans nowadays. Rejoice, motherxxxxxxx!

* (For some reason it’s got a presence in cold boxes in Minneapolis and Saint
Paul, which was not one of its original markets back when Carling and later Carling-National moved down from Canada to become a big player in the brewing industry in the U.S.A. The glory days of Mabel! But I digress.

At any rate, the market presence is probably due more to the consolidation of brands and brand swapping that went on when Heileman closed and Pabst and Miller split up some of the available brands.)"
Worst,Black Label Beer,2.55,"Well, this isn't horrible. It has a definite taste, which is saying a lot for an adjunct lager, which being a Canadian beer might explain that. Still it reminds me of a lot of a low level Euro lager, but not quite as appealing."
Worst,Black Label Beer,2.52,"So I just moved to Maryland from North Carolina four days ago and while I am still pleased about most aspects of the move, the beer situation is dire. They don't sell beer in supermarkets, so you have to go to specialty beer/wine places that have limited selection and inflated prices. The first one I entered the other day was scaring me pricewise so I went (relatively) cheap and came home with a twelver of this unknown entity.

Pours super light colored, with very aggressive carbonation and a thin cap. Nose is light sweet malt. Inoffensive but uninspiring. Taste is a little corny but it's not significantly worse than standbys like PBR or Natty Boh. Aftertaste is reasonably clean. Again, you can't judge this against craft brew, but against the Stroh's and Keystones of the world, it's at least in the middle of the pack."
Worst,Black Label Beer,3.48,Poured from a 12 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a clear golden yellow with a small white head. The aroma is grain and some sweet malt? The taste is smooth but lacks a lot of flavor. An average beer.
Worst,Black Label Beer,4.19,"Black Label Beer - Pabst Brewing Company with an ABV of 4.0% This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. The smell of Black Label Beer, is rich with grains and malts. You also pick up a hit of hops in the smell of this brew. Black Label Beer has the look and smell of most American Adjunct Lagers on the market. Now I',m not saying that is a bad thing. The taste is bold with flavors. You pick up on grins and malts in this taste of this brew. There is a nice smooth sweetness to this brew. The sweetness to this brew, it is not to bad but it is there. This is a easy drinking brew. This brew would go nice on a hot summer day. Black Label Beer , has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I like how this brew is so smooth. The mouthfeel of Black Label Beer is rich, smooth clean and refreshing. Overall I'm giving Black Label Beer a 4.25 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Pabst Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew."
Worst,Black Label Beer,3.18,Straight up monster crushing with this beer. Best drank out of s box of longneck returnables for a maximum of $7 this beer will make your dreams come true with its balance of moderate fizziness balanced with easy drinking malt and a kiss of earthy hops. Keep reaching for the stars.
Worst,Black Label Beer,1,cheap beer for cheap drinking and getting drunk cheaply. had to drink it to say that i drank another iconic american lager beer. nothing fancy at all....
Worst,Black Label Beer,2.25,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has lemongrass hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent lager"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.26,"This beer is the epitome of an adjunct lager. If you like this style, I can't see why you would rate this beer poorly, or ""awful"" as BA reviewers did. It's crystal clear, highly carbonated. Color leans more yellow than gold. Taste follows aroma, nothing out of the ordinary. Does lack depth and finish is a bit course, but overall easy drinking, good hot weather beer. 6 pk 16 oz was $4.99 + tax. If you like adjuncts, this is a good choice."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.29,"Well revisiting this old high school standby. Not as inexpensive as it used to be, so that's not a bonus. However, while it's got nary a head to speak of and looks watery, it's got a faintly malty grain presence in the smell and more so in the flavor, which is not off-putting at all. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, and there comes an oddly dry note toward the end of the sip that lingers. Perhaps by design to make one take another sip. I worked!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.24,"It pours light yellow, lots of bubbles and a white foamy head. There is a hint of everything, malt, and hops. This is the seltzer of adjunct lagers. No off flavors just not enough of anything to make this worth the low price, $4.99 for a 16 oz six pack near me."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.94,"12oz can best before: Sept 7, '21 into a tall lager glass.
L: Pours a lightly pale light corn yellow with a thin white head with a bit of retention, well carbonated with thin random scattered lacing.
S: Malt, flowery, white bread.
T: Semi-sweet and flowery, a bit rosey, grains, corn, thin sweet caramel malt and very lightly hopped. Overall fairly sweet.
F: Crisp, fizzy, light-bodied mouthfeel that has a fast and relatively smooth finish and a nice flow. It is not drying.
O: A decades old classic American pre-craft beer era adjunct lager. It is pleasant to drink and doesn't challenge one's taste buds. It is crisp, light, sweet, fresh and today was 0.55 cents per can. Drink it ice cold. It is good in it's style."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.56,"I think this may be the palest lager I've had yet. It's notably lighter in color than the ripe hay you usually get from a beer of this style. Thin streams of CO2 support a cloudy, bone white head with surprisingly good retention.
Old Miilwaukee's aroma starts off dryer than I expected. Aromas of soda cracker and fresh baked biscuits come through in the front. Just the barest hint of earthiness gives the nose a little depth. Coming through in the center, I catch a whiff of creamed corn, announcing the predictable presence of adjunct. The finish gives me a brief note of generic, leafy hops before fading into the distance.
Initial impression is of a smooth, rounded, refreshing profile. Slight flavors of cereal grain in the beginning. The mouthfeel definitely builds towards the rounded sort of center that can be a good thing in a refreshing lager. Sadly though, this is where flavors of corn adjunct come through. Adjuncts are accompanied by flavors of sulfur that are a little more present than they should be. Finish is dry and grassy.
Old Milwaukee has the same corn, sulfur, and adjunct flavors of so many mainstream lagers. If it weren't for these same issues, beers like Old Milwaukee might be bordering on decent beer."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.54,Old Mil has a beer I drank when I was in college because of the price when I was in college was 9 bucks a case and as I have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet. This beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away. EDIT after 1 year. Old Mil is one of the best overall premium beers I have had. it is smooth and heavy. While I do prefer Old Mil Light which has replaced Busch Light as my go to light beer.
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,3.14,"Clear pale yellow with good head for style. Sweet corn nose, also standard but unappealing. Very mild, light malt taste with a little dryness on finish. Lively effervescence. Unremarkable in style. Brewed under license in Canada by Sleemans in Guelph, Ontario."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,1.73,"You must drink it ice cold and very quickly. If that's the way you like to drink you can enjoy Old M, Pabst, Bud, Miller, Corona (with the lime) etc. Any of them will do. you cannot let it get even a little warm it becomes exponentially more awful with every degree rise."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,2.11,"Drank this right out of the can. Very faint smell. It didn't taste that bad. I picked up some grain and cereal notes, The mouthfeel was very watery with a slight odd aftertaste that I could not readily identify. Best drunk cold and on a hot day it is thirst quenching. The retro cans would make a good collectable. Overall as a gas station beer I'd give it a C. In all honesty at a party or just relaxing I'd reach for this over some of those ""snooty"" craft beers."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,4.22,"This is a crisp beer you drink cold in a frosty mug. No head, not a lot of smell, some bubbles, minimal lacing. Feels watery and goes down smooth which is perfect for the hot summer days ahead. Cheers"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,3,"Last week the family and I tested this with Miller High Life side by side, as both cost $3.19 for a six at our local joint. My wife and daughter preferred the High Life, as it's smooth--and no disrespect! I'd choose the high life gladly on special at the bar. But, the first thing I thought when I tasted Old Milwaukee is: ""they're using hops, not extract."" I looked it up--the page I saw said that they use two varieties of hops. The taste was a tiny bit more like a premium than I expected, and I appreciated that. Consider this a gentle nudge while something like Beck's is a slap in the face. I still believe Hamm's is the top of the list for super-cheap beers. But I put Old Milwaukee second! I wish I could find Schlitz and test it against Old Milwaukee."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,5,"First of all, you don’t have the right can pictured. The pin-up series with Stars & Stripes featuring Natalie Portman’s trashy sister Trish is an American icon.

Anyone who hasn’t cracked a cold Trish after jumping off the lawn mower in August simply hasn’t lived a life of redeemable value, in my opinion.

Worst,Old Milwaukee Beer,4.9,"Yet again, Here I am defending the Beer of the common man. Is this the best Beer you can get? Why hell no. In no way shape or form is this the greatest Beer I've ever had. This is just a average drinking beer for those that don't want to think about what they are drinking. Its cheap, it's in a Tall can and it ready for you to wash down that questionable hot dog you just ate. lets get started with the look. Pale Yella' stuff. Clear bright and bubbles like champagne. No head of foam. Now, moving on to smell. Hot dang, it took me a second to regain my thoughts after I cracked the top. In your face Cheap beer smell. Right off the bat smelling like that loud ass party going on next door. Yeasty, White bread. Smells like I plowed my face into some rising pizza dough. Now for the flavor. Actually, I must say it starts off good. Upfront Bold Yeasty goodness. Sweet white Bread, with a slight ever so eluding butter character. Middle gets a little nasty as those hops try their best to come through. A failed attempt with the trace amount of herbal notes. finishes poorly with zero hop cleanup. a absolute disaster. A finish amount of deli Bread. French White bread Loaf to be exact. The nasty finish is liken to that of Coors and Miller. Moving on to the feel. The texture is the redemption for this beer. nice and thick, creamy with not much bite from the carbonation. I'd say this beer has a perfectly medium body. Overall, a Beer you choose because you have nothing but $5.00 in your pocket and the worlds gone to hell anyway."

What we drank when we were poor.

S: typical aromas: bready pale/pils malt, delicate herbal-floral hop, mildly spicy alcohol; all aromas at average level

T: lightly-toasty, bready grain (more bread than dough)... bit of a leafy, carbonic bitterness lingers... slight grassy/husky aftertaste

Worth mentioning that if someone from higher position who really tasted that in Heineken and said like: “yeah, well that’s something we really have to produce and send out to the market” - they should have get rid of him.

Worst,Desperados,1.81,"The first words out of my mouth were, ""holy shiznit, what were they thinking?"" Or words to that effect.

Sugar, buttered toast, sugar, and more sugar on the nose. Mouthfeel is not insubstantial, but nothing special. Tastes like someone mixed Budweiser with Sprite, added a few drops of tequila, and a feckton of sugar. I had to add some Guinness to make it palatable—and even then I couldn't finish it.

Cannot recommend this Frankenstein's monster of a 'bier'."

It’s more like a wine cooler. If you look at it that way, there’s less sugar in this...drink...than a wine cooler, so not too awful. Came close to pouring this down the drain but something about it kept me wanting to drink it. Will not buy again, despite the cheap buzz."

Worst,Desperados,2.98,"""Interesting"" beer. Or, is it really a beer?
Wouldn't diss on this beer too much, even though I wouldn't say it's recommended. Overall quality is definitely poor-ish but still could drink this casually. I don't think there is any problem with this as a ""soda"" drink. As a beer it indeed is poor, or almost worthless in that sense.

Summary: If you intend to drink this you must approach with the idea in mind that this is NOT a beer but just a fun twisted soda drink. If you do that, I guess you could enjoy this like I do."
Worst,Desperados,1.06,"This is an abomination of a beer. Poor quality lager, too sweet with the added foulness of cheap tequila. Whoever came up with this wants their head looking at.

T - Initial tart green apple and corn notes fade to leave a boozy bitterness at the back of the throat. Overall harsh flavor despite the word ""smooth"" being printed almost ten times on the can.

M - Light-bodied with medium carbonation. Feels somewhat slick as it moves around the mouth.

O - Among others within the style, even other HGLs, this one is far from pleasant. Tick completed."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.4,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a corn syrup sweetness mixed with aromas of a dusty dankness as well as a metallic smell. With a touch of cardboard, the aroma is overall not the most enticing.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste mixed with a touch of grain and a decently strong paper taste. As the taste advances some light mustiness and more paper, as well as some metallic tastes comes to the tongue, leaving one with a metallic and sweet malt liquor taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the style and the more off tastes the feel is good, as it minimizes the impact of the flavors on the tongue to its greatest extent.
Overall – Not the best malt out there for sure…"
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.73,"24 oz. can:

Pours yellow. Fast carbonation kills the head to bubbles and a ring. No real lacing sticks.

The smell is of alcohol, some grain. Alcohol dominates, but overall not too offensive.

The taste makes my face involuntarily twinges at the taste. This is bad - even for the style. Raw alcohol with an odd sweetness that is tough to describe.

This is harsh - It says ""smooth"", but don't believe it.

This is for people who want a quick buzz at a cheap price. I somehow made it through the whole can, but never again. There are better malt liquors out there. This is one of the worst beers I've ever had. I don't recommend it, even to alcoholics looking for a cheap high abv brew."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.25,"You know, with so many good beers available, I keep trying these high gravity lagers just for completion's sake. And that's kind of sad. Sure, if you want 24 ounces of 12%, try this or one of the many other high gravity lagers available. Or get something quality with less alcohol and have two. Same result, better taste.

The flavor was also bland, except for a bit of alcohol sharpness.

The body was light and even, with a definite alcohol burn at the finish.

Drinkability was OK, although I would have preferred a smaller format. Overall, it is what it is; a cheap buzz. $1.99 for 24oz of 9.9% beer. You could do worse if you need to scratch this style itch."

Reviewed as: American Malt Liquor
Misc.: No canned on date; Can reads 9.9 pct. ABV

Recently was dared to review a King Cobra. Actually did not know that Malt Liquor was reviewable on Beer Advocate. Once I looked it up and saw I was, had to go with it. Once I saw that there were seven (seven!) (EDIT: now eight (eight!)) other Malt Liquors at the next-door market, made it a point to review one each Tuesday until I run out. Typically am against all the big boy beers, but I am breaking that rule for this challenge. Eighth up was Stack (High Gravity). Apparently it was brewed by United Brands in Lacrosse, Wis., and under special agreement in Memphis, Tenn. Can read “Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager is brewed with the finest extra malted barley and select hops for a bold yet exceptionally smooth taste. Stack 101 Smooth Lager is the first introductory brew style by Stack Brewing Company. Stack beer is brewed with superior ingredients for big, bold and smooth flavor.” A quick look at Beer Advocate and it had it at 2.13. Whoa. That meant it was only better than King Cobra and Old English 800. Going in I had it E40, Mickey’s, Hurricane, Steele Reserve 211, Natty Daddy, Old English 800 and King Cobra with the latter three pretty far back.

Poured a straw clear color with two fingers of off-white fizzy head. Lots of fast moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled kind of a mess initially like a bunch of flavors trying to get out of the can. Got red apple, sweet corn syrup, scrambled eggs, skunk, light strawberry, pear and buttered sourdough bread. Not smelling too boozy. (Smell - 2.75)

Usually the first taste of American Malt Liquors for me are not terrible, but the second one can be all over the place (usually much, much worse). However, this may have been the worst first taste of the lot. Second taste was even worse, but not as bad as it could have been. Specifically got sweet corn syrup, buttered white bread, spoiled pear, green apple, white grape, hints of strawberry, boxed white wine, barley, wet grain, scrambled eggs and wet skunky fart. Did not taste 9.9 pct. (Taste - 2.25)

Medium body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. Very unbalanced and tough to swallow. (Feel - 1.50)

Was kind of all over the place on a few categories here. Certainly wasn’t a fan. Would have it in the lower 1/3 of the Malt Liquors. (Overall - 2.25)

Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,2.89,"This beer was listed as 9.9% not 12%.
Good looking pour for the style.
Smell is pretty boozy
Taste is very close to a barleywine but on the low end of the scale. No bad flavors but the booziness is a bit hard to take. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a lightly bitter finish.
Overall not my type of beer but not bad for the style."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.42,"UBC LaCrosse WI and under special agreement Memphis TN on the can.

It pours a fairly dark yellow with a 1 finger head of foam with lots of bubble action.

Huge corn notes in the smell as well as some grain. It also smells the full 9.9% abv.

Corn first and foremost followed by some lemon twang that leans towards the tart side. Saying that it is rough tasting would almost be a compliment; smooth is mentioned a few times on the can.

The tartness intensifies as the beer warms and in a case like this, that is not a good thing.

I had to try it. It was cheap as dirt. I hope my sink doesn't mind a few ounces."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.05,"its cheap its 9.9% and its HORRIBLE
i like high gravity malt liquors but this is just bad , it was $1.65 but dont let that price point fool you
you can get much better for the same price.

its just so strong and full of corn like drinking bio diesel, its not super carbonated but it is bubbly
its reminds me of sunny delight , its so fake and full of artificial crap strong and syrupy .

this is so bad its so strong , i couldn't just drink it like a normal beer , i had to sip it like a wine , it took me a while to finish it.

i used to get 4 16 once for $1.99 at the center market and i used to be able to pound them like nothing and that was when it was 12% .
and after i had to drink this slowly because it was so bad i barly got a buzz . might as well of got a can of pbr...

this stuff is not good , i bought it to see if it was as bad as i remember and the can for the collection.

if you dont want to do either of this stay away , get old englishe ,hurricane, steel reserve, ice house edge or even natty daddy

anything is better than this even 4loco or other alco pop you can drown out the nasty with 7 up

i do not recommend stay away"
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.97,"I picked up a 24oz can at my local corner mart. Looks like a real winner. ABV is 9.9% per the label. ""Stack High Gravity Smooth Lager."" Reviewed as a malt liquor given its marketing, price point, and ingredients list. Served into a pilsner glass in Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Expectations are extremely low.

Served cold - straight from the fridge. Side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated.

A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.

Pours a predictable clear translucent yellow littered with abundant carbonation bubbles. It's got some nice vibrance and isn't weak looking like many malt liquors. No floating yeast particles/sediment is visible; it's quite clean. High transparency; you can read text through this beer.

The head is initially two fingers wide but recedes to a very thin layer atop the body inside one minute. Still, the retention is better than you'd expect for a budget range malt liquor at this high an ABV. Some limited spotty inconsistent lacing does cling to the sides of the glass after the head recedes.

Overall, it's an above average appearance for a malt liquor. I can't say I'm looking forward to trying it, but there aren't any egregious flaws.

Sm: Has a heavy malty and adjuncty sweetness. Loads of corn - mainly adjunct. Malt syrups/extract. Not as grainy as would be ideal. I also get some faint berry character - strawberry, I think. It's strange and artificial, but lends some needed complexity to an otherwise boring aroma. To its credit, there are no traces of the 9.9% ABV in the aroma. I also don't find any yeast character - or any really hop character - not even just a simple floral profile. The syrupy sweetness is off-putting, and I'm anticipating a sickly buttery texture, but this is far from the foulest malt liquor aroma I've come across.

Average strength.

T: The syrupy sweetness is certainly the core of the beer, but it isn't as offensive as anticipated. It's got some light graininess and could use more. Heavy corn adjunct is present alongside the aforementioned artificial strawberry note - which isn't doing the flavour profile any favors. I also get a cheap white wine character and some disgusting green apple notes. There's no real hop profile here.

To be fair, I will say that it hides its alcohol content pretty decently. But I can't say I like it; there's no complexity or subtlety here whatsoever. It's far from an intricate or gestalt build. Unbalanced as well.

Mf: Buttery, smooth, wet, and sticky. Overcarbonated as hell. Presence on the palate is abysmal; it's making me a bit ill. Has a bit too much weight, body and thickness for how little flavour there is; it's very filling. The texture doesn't seem well designed for this flavour profile. Execution is quite poor overall, but again I do think it's worth mentioning that it's not a hot or boozy brew, which is something of an accomplishment. That said, it's a pretty harsh mouthfeel overall.

Not astringent or gushed.

Dr: Not the worst malt liquor on the market, but far from the best. It's almost sickening, but I can't give it a lower rating than this because it isn't watery, and still tastes like beer. I'll be making a concerted effort to finish the entire can. It's not a sipper, but its low quality makes it tough to quaff and consuming it is making me feel terrible (especially in my stomach). ABV is hidden better than you'd expect. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anybody. Even just in this style and price range, there are better beers (and more widely available ones, for that matter). Stick to Steel Reserve for those nights when classy just doesn't cut it.

Reasonably atrocious.

D-"
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1.6,"Poured from a 24 oz. can into a pint glass. Appearance is a medium heavy yellow with white foam that dissipates rather quickly and leaves minimal lacing.

Odor is slightly lemony with a sourness. Kind of like the odor of a cheap lemon furniture polish. No hop smell, just malt and the leftover lemon smell.

Taste is not like a lager, which it says to be, but more of a malt liquor. Not crisp like a good lager, but has a sour taste with a lot of alcohol. Not smooth at all. No bitterness like an IPA or Pale Ale. Can't hardly even taste the malt.

Doesn't leave much on the palette. The front and sides of the tongue are somewhat in rebellion, but doesn't leave much mouthfeel one way or another.

So far, of the Malt Beverages I've tried this is the worst. On the positive side, if you are looking to get blind stupid drunk, you could ask for a better beer. Two of these would do it, but you would really be better off buying some cheap wine. This is the kind of beer you would use a brown paper back instead of a coozy. I may finish half of the glass I poured, but the rest of the glass and the can is going to be poured down the drain. I don't think the brewer was aiming to win any medals on this one, but just something cheap that you could get a buzz from and with this the brewer has succeeded."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,3.01,"I am comparing Stack against other malt liquors of it's type - high gravity ""lagers."" As such, it is one of the best in the pack -- highly alcoholic, cheap and drinkable. Compared to larger brands such as Colt 45 or Schlitz this is a much better experience. It's obviously not a good beer in comparison to all beers on the market, but it's a great cheap malt liquor.

It's not as smooth as Old English but it is almost there and has a higher alc/vol. If you are choosing something that is cheap and will get you drunk, I recommend this. If you are looking for a quality beer experience then obviously this is not a good choice."
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,1,"Correction on the abv this is 9.9% abv unless they are selling the pictured 12% abv somewhere else in the country, I'm always excited to try the next horrible malt liquor release, I'm guessing this will get the straw-ber-rita flavor out of my mouth. Appears the color of apple juice, faint white head, smells a bit like peanuts and geriatric farts with a metallic twang. Guess what this beer is going to go over big with the college kids under two bucks and they will temporarily lose their vision. My god, what is that stuff, lord help the beer industry, why is this swill acceptable there's dead Mexicans and Unicorn tears in this beer at least that's what the label screams with the font with depicted unicorn wings taking you to heaven when you have your first near death experience going head to head with your frat brothers with this beer in a beer pong tournament. Alright can we finally sue somebody for false advertisement, I give Coors the benefit of the doubt I'm sure they really frost brew their products, especially if these guys are able to label it as a SMOOTH LAGER, unless smooth is a contraction as in this lager will make you say someone I'm missing a tooth (s'm'ooth), because the people of West Virginia (my hometown) state a championing a beer that will help them loos s'more teeth. I can't even take another sip, okay for the review and the fine people of West by God Virginia here it goes...rancid flavors that are making me poetic. I will finish by saying this apple juice looking malt liquor will rot some more teeth out it will definitely s'mooth you. Mouthfeel is similar to sever acid reflux that never goes away, not typical GERD which is caused by food and drink we expose ourselves to this is gut wrenching stomach acid like on the palate that feeling after you've puked in your mouth but caught it just in time. Overall I think I've lead you to my overall impression of this fine canned 24 ounce smooth lager with 9.9% alcohol by volume...drain pourIII"
Worst,Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,5,"I actually liked this beer. It is nice and thick and heavy. This stuff gets you messed up fast(10% abv), so be careful of driving after drinking a can. I paid $1.69 for a can(24oz) just to try it, and it was worth every penny. I have seen a lot of bad reviews elsewhere about this beer, but hey, it is BEER, and a LAGER at that, so what do you want??? In my opinion, you can't get a better beer for the money. You may be able to find better beer, but NOT at $1.69 for a 24oz can...cheers!"

The taste is of Corn, a very sweet flavor with the hint of molasses for sweeteness. This is not a high quality Beer, its not as bad as other's in this group.

it does taste better than it smells but thats not saying much....its only drinkable with snacks...i had to resort to eating a hot dog bun and drinking heinz ketchup to kill the foul taste from my mouth as i was drinking it....about 30+ ounces into it...it finally became drinkable because i was starting to catch a serious buzz and i didnt care anymore....my wife was filming me and she was nauseated by the smell of it...and she was 6 feet away.

Drank straight out of the tallboy can. I can just imagine some douchebag in an Ed Hardy tshirt and hat slamming this. The can matches that motif perfectly.

Smell is noticeable even from a distance. Has that distinct smell of a nightclub - red bull and vodka on top of bud light and sweat. Sweet and sour.

Holy god, this is sweetened or something. Bitterness and alcohol poorly covered up by some sort of malt flavoring. Really awful and fake tasting. No smoothness about it. Each new sip is a shock to the system. So time to chug. No that's not exactly possible either, as it's so distasteful that it activates the gag reflex.

Man, this is really bad - just a vehicle to deliver 12% straight to the dome. I'd rather pay 8 more dollars for a bottle of a really satisfying 12% beer and enjoy it. But then again, the two worlds in which these occur hardly ever meet."

Smell: really smells like alcohol and raw hops.

Taste: high alcohol, I mean seriously, you taste rolling off your taste buds. Hops but light and slightly bitter.

Mouth: light to medium carbonation, little flat if you ask me.

Overall: this beer has one purpose, get you drunk for cheap. It is described as a smooth lager, maybe of your idea of smooth is like a thumbtack on the bottom of your foot. Salud!"

Dull orange gold color, murky pondwater haze, weird floating plankton sediment hanging in suspension with a steady column of rising carbonation in the center. Foam instantly fizzles out, audibly sizzling, leaving a thin floating scab in the center.

Smells like green apple jolly ranchers, grape juice, and bum wine.

Tastes like cheap wine, grainy apple, cheap booze. Numbing alcohol deadens the palate after a couple sips. Gassy, sweet, and astringent, harsh and unpleasant to say the least. Green apple aftertaste dries out the mouth like a shot of liquor, with a similar boozy aftertaste. A messy and harsh cheap buzz. Not worth the headache that starts in almost immediately after a few sips."

Taste: Mineral water, very little of anything. Not sure what the point of making an amber version that tastes the same as the regular ultra. Comical.
Overall: Skip it, just get the regular ultra if that’s what gets you off, this is just a gimmick."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.82,FIrst. I see this beer was added back in 2006. Why have I never seen or heard of Ultra Amber until 2019? So this beer is a watery brown ale basically. Its taste is pleasant and nothing offputting at all. Easy to drink. I have no problems with this beer at all.
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.28,Better tasting than regular michelob ultra or some of the other shitty flavors it comes in. Better than pure gold. Very watered down amber beer. About the same mouthfeel as yuengling light. 95 calories is impressive. Definitely can slam back some of these. There better than some but worse than more. If that makes any sense.
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,3.78,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/26/2016. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber, light orange color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey, caramel, roast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Minimal fruity notes in the aromas. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of honey, caramel, roast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, honey, caramel, roast, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness, complexity, and balance of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very good amber light lager. All around nice robustness, complexity, and balance of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Very clean pale/roast malt showcase, with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Mild residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best light lagers I have had."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.8,"3.2 carbs. 95 cals. 4% ABV. 12 fl oz. $6.99 USD per sixer.

I bought this because I was pleasantly surprised by Michelob Lager, but this compares unfavorably to that superior lager. This has some toasty amber malt notes but they're buried, leaving only an insipid one-two punch of 2-row barley and muted Noble hop grassiness to satiate.

Shallow and simple but certainly drinkable. Not a beer I'd want to revisit another sixer of, but there's no doubting it'd pair fine with pizza or spicy wings.

Low C (2.80) / AVERAGE"
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.45,watery cold wet ok for after mowing the lawn. definitely had worse than this. the label is cool i miss the old Michelob. its a light beer i dont expect a lot of flavor
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,5,Very smooth. Very refreshing. Very easy drinking light beer. I really enjoyed this one. Goes down very smoothly. Will definitely pick this up again. Good for a hot summer day. Though I do wish the price point was a little lower.Cheers.
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.44,"Marroon-ish hue and no real head to speak of. Smell and taste of yeast and some bitterness at the end. Very, very carbonated and almost drinks like a beer-flavored La Croix. It’s equally inoffensive and unremarkable for a light beer. If you’re maintaining a low-calorie diet I guess this one could make a lot of sense (3.2 carbohydrates, 95 calories, 4%ABV). It’s better than Bud Light."
Worst,Michelob Ultra Amber,2.7,"12oz bottle bb 2/1/18 poured into a vintage Michelob pils glass at fridge temp 4% ABV, 3.2 carbs, 95 calories. The beer pours bright very light amber with instantly gone off white head. Zero retention, zero lacing. The aroma is faintly beery mostly from yeast I suppose. The flavor is a dash of caramel malt applied to the most nuetral base beer ever. The mouthfeel is very thin bodied, highly carbonated, and very dry in the finish. There is a hint of soapy, oily texture in the aftertaste. Overall, good (for an ultra light beer)."
Worst,Crown Lager,1.02,"Reviewing this from memory, around 6 years ago.

This is possibly as bad as VB, I am not sure. In fact it just tastes the same, except the price is more and there is a big gay gold crown on the label. It just tastes like it has been pasteurized at 1000 degrees for a day...all of the ingredients are just so tasteless and heavy. All you want to do is either down it or chuck it. But it is too heavy to down...and too expensive to chuck!

The weird thing is that in Australia, it is a premium lager. Premium to what haha..? Seriously though I actually think VB is superior to this (at least in price). So what is it superior to?

Anyway, they obviously have a good marketing department, respect to them, somehow by putting a crown and gold tint to the label they convince a country that their product is premium, and they are still selling it!"
Worst,Crown Lager,2.94,"compared to its style across the globe, its better than many. sold in australia as an ultra premium lager, and priced as such, i am surprised to see it among the worst of the worst here on BA. i think its better than its ratings. in these styles, adjunct lagers, its not really about whats there, its about what isnt, and a strict adherence to some key criteria. there are no off flavors here, ever. its not boldly flavorful like good craft lagers, but there is an appreciable malt flavor to this without any metallics or sweetness, check that box. it also fits the mouthfeel specs, a little fuller bodied than the light lagers which i like, smooth and satisfying when ice cold, with ample carbonation and not much residual sweetness, check that box too. its also sort of better out of the bottle, which is generally how i drink this kind of beer, so thats cool too. i dont think it warrants the higher price it fetches, but i do think its got a leg up on a lot of the american adjunct lager brands, for whatever thats worth..."
Worst,Crown Lager,2.41,Pours clear golden with small white head. Sweetish aroma of malt and yeast. Sweetish malty and estery aroma with faint hoppy notes. Sweetish afteraste. drinkable.
Worst,Crown Lager,2.98,"Clear straw with white head
Faint hop and malt on the nose. Some fruitiness
Light and crisp, not much going on, but a slightly off taste on the finish as it warms
Light and refreshing mouth feel. Fairly heavy carbonation

Overall a sub-par Adjunct Lager. You could do a lot worse, but given Crown's ""premium"" status I expect more. The flavor profile is innocuous enough until it warms above fridge temp, and then there a definite off flavors"
Worst,Crown Lager,2.5,"Format: that nice old crownie 375mL brown bottle with a classy macro label. Always thought it looks pretty decent.

Appearance: poured into a tulip glass - mid-yellow in colour with limited visible carbonation. A very thin white head breaks up to a thin film and ring almost immediately.

Aroma: a sweet aroma of yeasts, grain and some sugar. A bit awkward at best.

Taste: and even more awkward here. Very skunky with a vegetal fug and some cheap adjuncts. I remember Crownies being better.

Aftertaste: some metallic flavours with a touch of grain. Still not brilliant, but at least the vegetal fug backs off.

Mouth feel: quite light in feel - almost watery - with a moderate carbonation.

Overall: an okay Australian macro lager, but really not up to scratch compared to others - even the standard macros. It is only AU$41 a case, but there are better around."
Worst,Crown Lager,2.01,"Poured from the 375mL bottle into a pint glass.

The beer is a nice pure golden color with lots of carbonation coming through. Head dissipated almost immediately and was foamy and offwhite. Typical.

S: The smell coming off of this one is noticeable right upon opening and that's not entirely a good thing. Typical grainy smell but also some sort of sour and vegetal note. Not skunky, but not very natural or pleasant either.

T: Watery and very light on flavor but what is there isn't even your normal beery flavor. There's a sour note in the middle with a light bitterness covered up by an unnatural sweetness. Not undrinkable, just not that good.

This reminds me of a second rate Euro Pale Lager and seems like that's what they are going for as those are hugely popular. Even so, I've had better even for the style. Not even very refreshing due to the weird flavors in the beer.

Just go for a Bud or Fosters."
Worst,Crown Lager,2.09,"375ml bottle poured into pint glass 15/3/14

A clear straw yellow with plenty of bubbles but just a short lived finger of foam that leaves a partial ring and a few random patches

S sweet grains and some wet cardboard, very little going on, a little hay maybe

T tastes much worse, chemicals and pennies, not quite skunky but a little musky, some cooked veggies, and soggy cereal

M thin and watery, soft carbonation, about what I expect from a macro but the aftertaste is awful and lingers

O not horrible until you taste it, doesn't really improve after that

this ones a wolf in sheep's clothing, looks good before you open and drink it, well and truly overpriced avoid this one boys and girls"
Worst,Southpaw Light,1.3,"THis is just bottom tier broke ass drunk laborer drink for after a long hot shift in a FL beach kitchen.
Sweet fizzy metallic pop to go with a cigarette, and recommended/given to me by a nice Chicano milf, then later found out it was a favorite of another worn out party milf in MS, because it had the lowest price of a 12 pack at Chevron.
Failwater"
Worst,Southpaw Light,1.59,"Have had this on a few occasions, and can't get into it. A macro light beer in all aspects, though it does have a slightly stronger hop profile than the usual suspects, i.e. ML and BL."
Worst,Southpaw Light,3.02,"Some mild malt sweetness up front, not much else here apart from beery throughout. Adjuncts low but there, otherwise, it was pretty good for a macro."
Worst,Southpaw Light,2.65,"Super weak and thin mild yellow appearance, 1/2"" white head vanishes before your eyes. Aroma was water, corn, metal.

Taste actually establishes itself as a not terrible light adjunct lager. Even a mild hop note or two at most. Nothing terrible about it other than its appearance. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated.

Tailgate stuff, 5% abv for a light beer is actually substantial."
Worst,Southpaw Light,2.75,"I remember getting this beer for $8 a 12-pack and using it in the water-bath of my BBQ smoker when I made ribs. I'd use 7-9 beers in the water-bath, so what wasn't used there was consumed with the meal.

Fond memories might make this beer rate higher than it should but maybe not. I remember it being a light beer that didn't taste light, and was still better than most of the schiessebier BMC makes (even though it is ultimately a Miller product.)

I'd like to try a bottle now... just for comparo."
Worst,Southpaw Light,5,"When I realized I was willing to drive all over the place to find it I understood finally that this is my favorite beer. If you are looking for a light beer that has a full-body feel and taste then this is the beer for you. All other light beers end up tasting like water with some beer in it by comparison. With that said, compared to Miller Lite, you'll be having an extra (approx.)thirty calories, but considering the trade off, it is well worth it. This is easily Miller's best (""light"") beer. Well done!"
Worst,Kirin Lager,3,Had a few of these with dinner at a Japanese restaurant several years ago. I don't remember anything special either good or bad about it. It went well with the food and tasted ok. Hence the average rating of 3.
Worst,Kirin Lager,3.8,"In Japan you have to drink a bottled beer to enjoy the real taste, at least that is how ai felt. Cans here have a sort of metallic taste and beers on tap can also be somewhat strange.
Now the first time I had this was in a 500 ml bottle and it was better than expected! It has quite a full taste without any disturbing bitterness, it is by far better than the Ichiban Shibori that Kirin is pushing so much. Might even say that this is the best Japanese lager... or maybe I just have to try everything in a bottle."
Worst,Kirin Lager,3.52,"This is a fairly simple and easy to drink example of a rice lager, with just about enough flavor to complement a Japanese meal without overpowering it. Refreshing and quite thirst-quenching too."
Worst,Kirin Lager,3.75,"Well, here we go, just what I needed, a beer style I'm not entirely enthralled with but will try to say some positive words the best way I know how.
Poured into a pilsner glass, the appearance was a clear yellow color with rapidly rising carbonation bubbles trying to fill a rapidly dissipating little white head. Barely any lace.
The aroma had corn syrup, sweet rice, light floral hop tones and light tones of alcohol.
The flavor copied the aroma fairly spot on. I'd say mostly corn syrup in the aftertaste.
The mouthfeel was about light bodied, perhaps just a pinch above. Carbonation felt decent. ABV felt as projected. Mild sweet corn/rice finish.
Overall, though not a style I seek often, this actually isn't a bad beer. One thing it does have going for it is there aren't really known flaws to this."
Worst,Kirin Lager,3.06,"This is it: The real Kirin, made in Japan with malt, rice and corn, in all its 334mls of glory. If you’ve ever had that other crap they sell here in Australia - Kirin Megumi or whatever it’s called - you might think that you’re not missing out on anything. But you are: Real Japanese Lagers are a delightful crispy treat - like Peking duck. Problem is if want a real Japanese Lager you need to shop at a Japanese boutique grocery store, and they’re few and far between. I shop at Genki Mart Alderley, they have a small but decent selection of real Japanese beers... it’s a shame the powers that be at Kirin feel that they have to brew their Lager as a crappy Aussie Macro Lager under licence - there’s got to be a real market for authentic Japanese Lagers now.

Poured from a 334ml bottle into a stein.

A: Hazed light golden body with a 1 centimetre white head that compacts down to a lace blanket. Looks fairly good as far as Lagers go, not sure about the haze though - a bit uncommon with this style. 7/10.

S: Aroma is quite Sake forward, which is to be expected whenever rice is on the malt bill. Grainy notes, along with a touch of sweet corn round out a brew that is almost entirely malt-driven, again: to be expected. Overall the aroma is nothing remarkable, however real Japanese Rice Lagers tend to be average in this department. 5/10.

T: Dryyyy, malty/grainy/Sake from the get-go. Mid palate accentuates that dryness with - you guessed it: more dryness, hint of sweet corn as well. Finish is like a crisp winters day in the Sahara - long and dry. Did I mention dry? Yes? Ok, glad I covered that off. Taste couldn’t be further from the crap that’s brewed under licence that I’m starting to wonder if they even try to follow the original recipe. 6/10.

M: Mid to light bodied, none of the wateriness of the Australian brewed version, and a thin but active carbonation. Heaps better than expected. 7/10.

D: This is not a bad beer at all, not Yebisu Premium good, not Koshihikari Echigo good either, but a nonetheless decent example of a real Japanese Rice Lager which has been completely distorted by this “brewed under licence” crap. Why not just come out and say it - we Kirin brew under licence because we can trick consumers into thinking that they’re actually drinking a Japanese Lager when they’re really just drinking an [insert country name] Lager instead? #drinkrealjapaneselagersnotcrap 7/10.

Food match: Get some salted edamame beans and go for gold(en beer)."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2,"Let me start by saying I can hold my liquor/alcohol quite well, and in no way mean that as bragging but when this beer came out I drank 2 24oz cans because it was cheap. Well I went home and distroyed my entire house for no reason and couldn't even remember doing it, but I was the only one home!! SMH"
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.48,"Purchased a 24 oz can for $1.29 including beverage tax at a gas station in Dayton, Ohio.

Look: Straw yellow color, medium head. No lacing.

Smell: Strong sweet smell, green apple and malts.

Taste: Very, very sweet. I can barely taste any alcohol. Was actually disappointed by the lack of graininess since I genuinely love a good AAL. Virtually no hops. Remarkably inoffensive for the high alcohol content, but no character either, almost like beer flavored soda with less carbonation and some alcohol. The sweetness is just WAY too much, even for a malt liquor fan. There is still some fusel taste, but it is masked by the extreme sweetness.

Feel: Very light body, even lighter than *only* 8% abv cheap lagers like Steel Reserve and even the watery Natty Daddy. Weak carbonation, which means you can chug easily and get drunk very fast, which may be dangerous with a beer of this ABV.

Overall: My previous review was more positive, but honestly I can't recommend this beer for anyone. As a malt liquor, it is terrible even compared to the usual high gravity brews, and seems to be targeting the alcopop crowd with its excessive sweetness, but won't please anyone except those looking for the fastest buzz from a beer. Interesting because it pushes the limits of what is considered beer, but even Earthquake is way better. Stay away!"
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.78,"Do not buy this. yes 10% alcohol is about twice that of the other drinks. DRINK TWICE THE OTHER F_N DRINKS!!!!!

look: 5. looks ghetto like a 40 should, looks like 10% alcohol, a Wisconsin product while im a state away from home
smell:2 - eww. kinda opinionated and sweet
taste:1- I REGRET SPENDING $10 OF MY LAST $25 ON 4 OF THESE!!!!!!!!!!!! damn indiana sunday-no liquor-laws making me try to bulk up on this shit!! tastes like a bad brew, sweetened with the corn syrup from a warm 7-up. you know that corny ass unrefreshing shit that makes you imagine a lobe of corn (a lobe of corn.... thats a thing, right??) instead of the alleged ""lemons"" and ""limes"" that supposably make up 7-up? idk, tastes liek corn to me.... Like apart from the 500 calories of alcohol due to the 4 ounces pure alcohol, this tastes like it had 200$ of sugar. or a jar or two of sucralose. its disgusting. i hate it. do not buy it.
Feel:4 i am drunk though, i feel slighty disgusted with myself for drinking such ..... (whats the liquid version of slop? slop is a liquid????) slop.
Overall:3. because drunkness is 5, and taste is one, it equals 2.5. 2.5 rounded is 3, ccording to my teachers. thats generous AF though, because taste should really be negative 5. so really the score is -5 billion, cuz reality. do not buy this.

look:close your eyes
smell: dont breathe through your nose
Taste-awful
feel- drunk ppl dont have feelings silly."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.11,"24oz monstrous can, procured during happy hour at the Pizza Brew in Calgary. Stereotypical inner city brick wall graffiti imagery makes up the childish label.

This beer pours a clear, medium golden yellow colour, with one fat finger of puffy, somewhat foamy bone-white head, which leaves some stringy webbed lace around the glass as things quickly move southwards.

It smells of that standard Minhas house essence - musty dank cardboard, industrial effluent, apple cores, and an acetone-heavy metallic booziness. The taste is more of the same - wet paper, a suggestion of grainy corn malt, industrial park alcohol, adult bubblegum (i.e. boozy), apple mush, and very little else - but that's not the point here, is it?

The carbonation is soft, but fairly frothy, the body medium-light in weight, smooth like vodka after that initial burning sensation wears off, and airily creamy, for some reason. It finishes sweet, all surprisingly restrained alcohol heat and bland apple fruitiness, like a cheaply boozed-up cider.

Strangely not the most off-putting, or awful-tasting offering from this brewery - sure it's alcoholic, but it bears that badge with pride, and a pleasant enough softness. Other than that, however, this is indeed the lowbrow shit you might take it for, all other things being equal."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,"Okay, this is not a beer to trifle with. If one were to drink a 24 oz. can of this and then drive a motor vehicle, then he would be almost guaranteed to get arrested on a DUI charge. I drank only a 12 oz. serving (on an empty stomach) and was thoroughly drunk. Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor has a thick, off-white, creamy head and a deep golden appearance. I was amazed by the abundance of ragged lacing. The can design is completely politically incorrect, and it nuances all the wrong things about malt liquor. But, for those of us who enjoy cruising the underclass of the beer world, it is an interesting beer. No, this is certainly not the type of beer I'd drink on a daily basis, but, for kicks, I am enjoying the ride (so, please excuse any inebriated verbiage). Four O has a strong apple aroma and some grain can be detected in the smell as well. The taste is highly sweet and fruity, with some alcohol sting to it. Mouth-feel is rather heavy, and this concoction finishes wet and sloppy. Put it to you like this: if all you care to drink is Busch, Budweiser, Miller High Life, Shiner Bock, and Coors Banquet, etc., and you don't appreciate the ""wild side"" of beer, then don't fool with this stuff. But, however, if you like to go into forbidden zones from time to time, I'd recommend you try this (with extreme trepidation, to be sure). Well, for those who relish trying outlandish, unacceptable drinks like this, I'd recommend a try (at home, with an iron-clad assurance that you will not, under any circumstances, operate a motor vehichle). Although you may not like this beer, you can't really argue that it's not interesting.

UPDATE NOTE: About an hour after writing this review, I was hit with a nausea that lasted over 24 hours. So, that's what I get for going out on a limb and sampling this filth. I really can't, with a clear conscience, recommend this trash. My advice is to stay away from it and not damage your psyche.

RJT"
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.24,"Oh boy oh boy oh boy! This right here is taking me back. Back to the days when I literally drank beer out of a brown paper bag. Except now, I pour it in a glass. Strange.

Crystal clear straw yellow color, foamy white head is surprisingly sticky on the side of the glass.

The aroma is a sick adjunct combo, with a really putrid sourness. Huge corn smell.

The flavor is very sweet. Highly grainy. Then, like a bomb, the alcohol kicks in. It is like someone dropped a shot of everclear in a Bud Light.

Alcohol burn on the throat and tongue. But decently carbonated.

Uh...drink it cold. It obviously is created to get you crunk, cause it is a cinch to slam and not savor. Which, in a strange way...makes it...kind of drinkable? Whoa. I think I am gonna have my beer geekdom revoked."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.27,"I CAN't believe that I have finally gotten around to this beer! It has been in my refrigerator for a couple of months, awaiting me getting in the mindset to crack open a 24-ounce CAN of what I just know, in my heart of hearts, will be absolute and utter rubbish. I have succumbed to too much garbage in CANs to expect anything else. This is the backswing of the CANQuest - on the upswing are some really quality brews from serious brewers and then there is this kind of thing. Onward!

I got a finger's worth of bone-white head out of my pour with low retention, settling into wisps. Color was a light, lemony-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the same fusel alcohol/bubblegum quality that has been noted in many like beers. Let us call it like it is - this is cheap, mass-produced swill intended for an audience whose sole purpose in drinking this is not for enjoyment, but instead to get as banged up as cheaply and as quickly as possible. Mouthfeel was very thin with a raspberry-candy like taste on the tongue. THAT was totally unexpected and nearly caused me to gag. OK. I just made a deal with myself - I will drink half of the CAN to give it a fair shake, but the rest of it goes. In fact, I am doing a drainpour right now of everything NOT in my glass at the moment so that I will not even be tempted to finish it. Finish was breathtaking and not in any good way. My chest hurts, I CAN feel the sugar leeching the water out of my brain on my way to a world-class hangover, and my asthma is kicking. Oof. Shame on whomever made this for public sale!

I dislike that I CANducted a drain pour at any point during The CANQuest (tm) & I humbly apologize for having done so. Today is Sa, 26Mai 2018 & I am revisiting this beer in its entirety to put things right. The CANQuest (tm) has a CANmitment to drinking EVERY beer to the dregs/lees/punt/kick & this represents an early failing on my part. It also may NOT have been reviewed to style, but my current policy is NOT to f**k with original, often early, scores. Sorry.

I am SO ashamed of my original that I am going to revisit this beer. My overall impression, given 10+ years of CANflection, is that it is not as horrible as I made it sound. It is as advertised - an American Malt Liquor designed to get you crunked. It is still within the style guidelines, but I don't even want to CANtemplete them. It is like quantifying garbage. ""The maggots lent a piquant flavor ... "". Okay, it's a FANTASTIC AML, but as a beer in general, it SUX balls! Yer the top of the bottom. This is unfit for human CANsumption & any ""To Style vs. To Taste"" reviews should be taken acCANdingly!"
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.18,"I recently got a 24oz can of this from my girlfriend- she had noticed my ""malt liquor kick"" as of late and decided to get me some real ghetto fuel, all 10% ABV of it. The can proclaims ""Street Legal"" on the front. The can is interesting, there is artwork depicting a city skyline with a brick wall below it and graffiti depicting the brand and details. Very appropriate considering the target audience for this beer. Here is my impressions:

A- Again the can is interesting, the beer pours a straw yellow. Small head that foams rapidly and disappears just as rapidly. Looks like a budweiser or typical american lager.

S- Smells somewhat ""syrupy"", strong corn odors. Not a favorable sign prior to tasting

T- I can honestly say this stuff is pretty low on my list of the worst things I have tasted. I made a batch of mead last year that went wrong and it came out with a really high (17%) abv- this taste almost just like that with a strong, sweet corn flavor. It literally tastes like it might be a liqueur of some sort. I am not sure it is possible to chug this even with it ice cold. It would be interesting to find out the amount of Carbs per serving of this stuff. After a 1.5oz tasting glass of this I am not sure I can drink the can (damn $1.35 down the drain).

M- Syrupy, do not want to hold it in my mouth any longer than I have to. Leaves a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste

D- Awful, I have a feeling if you could put this down rapidly you might vomit. It probably helps to be drunk already or homeless to handle this stuff in quantity. The ABV puts it on par with wines for serving size of 6oz in one standard drink (as opposed to 8oz for a typical malt liquor)

Conclusion- It might be fun to show off at a party or if you are feeling the need for a quick drunk. Undoubtedly this stuff will cause a nasty hangover in quantity. Open can of this only in case of emergency!!"
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.02,"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit malty. Taste is yuck. Nothing but alcohol, I would have been better served pouring this into a shot glass. Feels light and yucky in the mouth. I really struggled to finish this can. Overall a poor excuse for a beer."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.44,"Thrid review tonight , not inebriated yet ... but I will be after this 24 oz...

app.-3.0 Looks average for a malt, nice and light golden , just like a colt 45 or mickey's.

smell-4.0 Sweet sweet malt and hints of alcohol even in the smell. Kind of looked forward to the taste.

taste- 1.5 Malt and alcohol! I cannot even say the alc. is contained well because it's not.

mouthfeel- 3.0 average, medium body , due to the alcohol

drinkability 2.0- I can drink this , but it'll be hard to pretend to enjoy it

If you want to get messed up drink two of these... otherwise steer clear of this malt liquor."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.12,"Pale golden with a small pure white head that quickly shrinks away. The smell is very solvent like grain alcohol with a sweet caramelized onion smell. This shit is just bad, metallic and way to hot with a sweet vegetal note that makes it unpalatable. This is the worst malt liquor I've ever had, a drain pour."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.81,"Sent as part of the ""Good Bad and Ugly 08"" BIF. As per the conditions of the BIF, I must review and send an Ugly beer. Here she be!

Dispensed from a 24oz can with a brick wall on the side enblazoned in spray paint graffitti the words ""Four O Street Legal"". Not sure of what street they are referring, but whatever.

Pours a clear straw color with a very nice looking white head. Plenty of lacing and the head actually stays for quite a bit. Nice.

Aroma is corn cob and sweet liquor. Possibly some rice adjunct as well. Not a drop of grains but I wasnt expecting that from a malt liquor. Again, not too bad so far.

Kind of sweet when it first hits the tougue. Then the rice cereals kick in. A little bit of that alcohol gag comes up due to the sharpness and solvency of the alcohol. Kind of an ""old valentine day candy"" sort of taste to it: a bit stale yet sweet and somewhat tolerable.

I have to say, this wasnt as bad as I was expecting. A beer with graffitti on the label cant be that good but this wasnt all that bad. Of course, I served this ice cold and as it warmed, it became less and less drinkable, but I cant say this is the worst beer I have had.

Pretty dry finish and candy alcohol in the finish as well. Overall, sweet and alcoholic. If I was REALLY desperate, I may have this. By all means, spend your money elsewhere."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.96,"Received as part of a winter holidays gift of malt liquors from a friend who doesn't drink beer and thought this was something I'd like. As hilariously misguided as the gift was, I do appreciate trying something new and something I'd never buy on my own.

Pours a very clear corn husk yellow, with a one-finger white head that sticks around a fair amount, given the alcohol content. Fruity esters, sweet, dominate the nose. Perhaps it's low expectations, but the taste wasn't that bad. Clean and not as buttery as I am used to in my malt liquor travels, but fruity in flavor and slightly buttery in texture, and a very mild carbonation. Body is heavy with sweetness, but not quite cloying. One of the better malt liquors I've had, but not something I want to encounter ever again in my life. Once is more than enough."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.68,"Well, it's a struggle to know where to begin. Gotta love a can that tags itself. Pours like a beer syrup, with little head that looks ""infected"" (little deposits of bubbles at nucleation sites). Aroma of corn and cider. Hops like they ran past the mashtun with a hop cone at some point in the process. Medicinal and alcoholic. Taste is just as bad. Somehow I think of Duvel: what that is, this is the opposite. No sublety or grace or balance, but oddly enough, no worse to drink than the PBR I had last night: there's something compelling about the big bruising flavor, like a big, dumb drunk that you enjoy listening to at the bar only because he's not picking on you and you're sure he's bound to pass out soon."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.91,"Purchased a 24 oz. can of Four O at a liquor store in Atlantic City, NJ. The can was left in a hot car for a few hours to warm up the beer and give the aromatics a chance to shine.

Appearance: Pours a nice clear yellow with a solid finger-and-a-half of foam that quickly dissolves away. Many streams of fine bubbles from the bottom of the glass.

Smell: Very corny. A slight bitter element, almost as if some of the metal from the can leeched into the beer. Aroma detected at least two feet away from glass. Not pleasant.

Taste: For a beer with a cartoony graffiti landscape and the words ""Street Legal"" and ""10% ABV"" on the can, it showed a surprising amount of sophistication. There was a very strong corn taste, with the harsh bitterness, but lurking behind everything was a smooth cherry taste, more like Robitussin than maraschino, but cherry nonetheless.

Mouthfeel: The fizz just wouldn't stop. Stuck to my teeth and roof of my mouth. Not pleasant.

Drinkability: I finished the 2-4 of 4-0 quite easily once I got past the first 8 oz. of it. The beer's feel mellowed out once exposed to air. The price wasn't right ($1.55 plus tax) but that notwithstanding this is an adequate malt liquor for, well, Atlantic City."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.5,40 ounces can courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a golden color beer with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing surprisingly. Aroma of fruity ester with some alcoholic phenols. Taste is not as bad as expected with some subtle adjunct and some fruit ester. The alcohol is really noticeable and I guess can be expected from a 10% malt liquor. Medium body with some good carbonation. This was definitely not as bad as expected but not something I would go for again thought.
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.27,"Appearance: Pours a clear, gold body with a wispy white head.

Smell: Corrosive-smelling scent of corn and chemicals. Cornicals!

Taste: Sweet, chemical laden malt flavor with more corn adjuncts. Nothing that would pass for hop flavor of bitterness. A fusel curb-kick of a finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation. Searing alcohol presence.

Drinkability: Ugh, I really disliked it. That's just the way I roll, baby."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.29,"Poured from a 24oz can a crystal clear straw colour with a big pillowy white head. Looked halfway decent, but that's where it stopped. Smell is huge corn adjunct (you're stunned, I know) and that's about it. Taste is huge corn adjunct, as well, with a pretty big metallic element in the taste. Mouthfeel greatly lacks carbonation and is rather bland and lifeless. Neither this beer nor this style are for me, but I figured I'd give it a go. The only good thing I have to say about this is that it does a fantastic job of concealing the 10,0%abv."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,1.51,"I can't believe I'm adding this beer. But hey, I feel that all beers should be represented on this site, even bad ones. And I also hope that this review will save somebody the pocket it took to buy a smaple of this cheapo. But I'm always on the hunt for afforable but decent beers.

Medium golden-yellow with a large, fluffy, white head. Smell is of alcohol for sure, along with some grain and corn husk. The taste. Woah! Yeah thats 10% abv alright! The alcohol sting dominates this one but maybe thats a good thing because there arent any flavors in there that I care for. Hmm. It starts out wickedly harsh but surprisingly gets slightly better as it goes or wait, I think thats just the heavy alcohol numbing the senses. It has a medium-thin body, greasy texture and moderate carbonation.

My search for decent cheapos continues. Definitely not a winner here. This it just cheap crap period. End of story."

Aroma is heavy on cooked veggie scent with some tart apple phenols approaching the ol' schnause alcohol is noticeable comes off sweet overall with no hop aromatics sorry folks. Taste is cloying sweetness flaked corn and rice presence is off setting some fruity tones after fermenting it out to 10% abv damn it's rough though. Mouthfeel is syrupy as it warms I'm not enjoying this stuff body is medium to light. Drinkability a novelty beer enjoy it while your in college I did."
Worst,Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,2.64,"This can of Four O is the challenger in the latest malt liquor grudge match that I like to call Malt Likkapalooza. It will be entering the ring today with A-B's own Hurricane High Gravity. The can depicts the Four O name spray painted on a brick wall beside the words 'street legal' with a cityscape in the background. That's to demonstrate its street cred no doubt, but the 10.0% ABV is enough for me. Who knew that La Crosse, Wisconsin was such an urban jungle?

Bright gold with multiple steady streams of fine bubbles leading up to an ivory-colored head that is ultimately as creamy as Hurricane HGL's cap, but is more sticky. There's an amazing amount of lace on the glass for a beer with a double-digit ABV. Definitely one of the best looks that I've ever run across for a malt liquor.

Just as the 'label' graphics promised, the nose is bold. It's incredibly sweet and apple-like. In fact, the beer smells like a generous portion of applejack was added to the glass. It's lower on hops that Hurricane and higher in alcohol. Surprisingly, there's very little nastiness to either one of these noses. Four O takes round two convincingly.

I'll be honest, I feared this beer a little bit. There's really nothing to fear, once tasted, but I do fear what trouble I might get into if I downed a few of these bad boys back to back. Like the nose, the flavor is brash, bold and bordering on hostile. It's everything that most malt liquors are times two. Strangely enough, I find it appealing in a perverse sort of way for that very reason.

Yeah, it tastes a little too much like grain alcohol. Yeah, it takes a little getting used to. Yeah, it'll make your head spin if you drink too fast. But it's sweet enough and just well-mannered enough that I find myself sipping it between sentences rather than the Hurricane. What better recommendation could there be?

It looks as though Four O has run the table on Hurricane. Its mouthfeel is more enjoyable due to its medium-full, almost creamy stickiness. All of those malt sugars (and added sugar?) have seen to it that the beer coddles the mouth, in contrast to the flavor's tendency to rough it up.

Four O is the overwhelming winner of Malt Likkapalooza IV. I'll admit, I'm surprised by the outcome. The over-the-top promise of the name and the can graphics were borne out in the actual drinking. If you like your malt liquors subtle, look elsewhere. If you like them loud and jarring, yet sippable, grab a can of Four O and hang on for dear life.

[I don't recommend drinking most of the can while reviewing though, because my brain is in neutral and my fingers are so numb that I'm having a hard time feeling the keys.]"

$2 @ One Stop Liquor Outlet, Pennsauken, NJ

If you're going to drink this, drink it cold. That means if you've got it in a brown paper bag, down it!

It has the typical malt liquor appearance with a more-golden-than-the-usual-lager color, and the quick to diminish bright white head. It does, however, leave some nice thin lacing if you put it into a glass (and who would want to do that?).

The nose expresses fruit (this is a lager, right?) and alcohol with sweetish malt trailing. Hmmmm... there are some higher alcohols here too.

In the mouth it's medium-full bodied and crisp, but the heat of the alcohol gives it an extra edge.

The flavor is not as alcoholic as the nose and mouthfeel suggest... oh, who the hell am I kidding, it's frickin' LOADED! Drink it cold unless you like the burn! The sweet malt does round it out a bit though, and on that note it does have some graininess to it, it's not just all adjunct.

Overall it's not the best but it's not the worst. In fact, it's kind of the poster child for what people think malt liquor tastes like. There are better examples of the style out there and I'd suggest you try to find them as opposed to drinking this."
Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,3,"Poured a 500ml can into a pint glass. A one finger bubbly white head on a clear pale amber. Good head retention and lacing.

Better than I expected"
Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,3.87,"(1 liter can, 07APR20; purchased cold single 2 days ago from Beer World, Liberty, NY, sipped on soon after over the course of 2 mobile hours, pouring little by little into my new Genesee 9 oz tasting glass... review cobbled from recollections of that journey)

10% 'quality lager beer'; black can, red/gold/white branding (different label than what's pictured here)... slightly hazy (decomposing), amber liquid; ample foam build with each pour, and it actually collared and laced a bit... on the nose: fusel-kissed medicinal spice, barmy yeast, artificial fruit aroma undertones... on the palate: Wells Banana Bread beer, nuttiness enhanced, dried out and fortified/tainted with cheap, rotgut ethanol... textures: brief, round swell up front, dropping clean in the finish aside from a mild oily warmth, but no burn; delicate tickle from the aforementioned spice/nut elements; mild effervescence

summary: almost 12 years to the day, I finally found another beer with a nearly identical flavor profile to that of the Carlsberg Special Brew I had at the Prince of Wales pub in Aberdeen, Scotland; blown away: memories, reminiscence, flashbacks flooded my mind... that said, this isn't a spectacular swill (but I'd love to try a fresh can), though it's remarkably drinkable because, dang, I did end up finishing the whole can somehow (pacing?), and experienced no recoil from beginning to end... I guess it was worth the detour (1800)"
Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,4.2,"Faux 10% ultra strong beer or as me and my compatriate have affectionately renamed it: Beans. The stylish can reimagines the can as a can of beans and leans more to the experience as the physical attributes of the beer itself. Beans can turn your bad evening into a great one very quick, although the taste leaves some to be desired, this can be fixed by drinking beans out of the can which adds to the feeling that beans can give you which is rarely a tactic I have seen from my fellow beans drinkers. I urge everyone to forget about the taste of beans and to focus on how your day brightens after consumption. Beans can change your life, give beans the respect it deserves.

Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,2.06,"Cloudy golden with a huge white head with decent lacing. This was the highlight of the beer. Aromas of nail polish remover, super sweet fruits especially pear and lemon, and boozy grains. Taste is so so so sweet, like wow, with booze to clash and amplify, esters are too nuanced to describe the sweet fruit, with some metal on the backend, a complete mess. Feel is boozy, resinous, sickly sweet, and sticky almost gummy. Not worth your time"

Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,1.92,"This is...WHEW! That one word could pretty much sum up the whole experience. I used to praise Euro strong lagers for doing what American malt liquor brands never could, but THIS. I don't know what they were thinking with this. The smell is akin to the most alcohol-forward malt liquors, chemical. The taste retains that cleanliness found in euro strong lagers compared to their American cousins, but it is just TOO MUCH ALCOHOL. I cannot stress this enough. It goes down hot. They were nice enough to add in a seemingly random helping of hops and a touch of sweetness, but none of the rough attempts at balancing I've had in British offerings of the same style. This is just random ingredients mixed together with MAXIMUM ALCOHOL being the only attempt. Making this is itself absurd, importing it to the United States where I am attempting to enjoy it now, is just another level. Why?"
Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,2.71,"This will knock you back, on smell alone. It has a deepness to it. It does loose it's luster as you go because of how strong it is.

Taste rating in words: It's putting a ladder on scaffolding on a picnic table in a truck bed. Just why?"
Worst,Faxe Extra Strong,1.88,"Initially gave this a 1.75 in my earliest days as a BA. For some reason decided to give this another chance. Must be a glutton for punishment. Anyway here goes. 500 ml LCBO purchase for $3.60 CDN, a whopping 5 cents cheaper than the 9% Polish Baltic Porter I've been enjoying lately.

Appearance - Clear rich golden color, not much in the way of bubbles and a tidy two finger white head that appears fluffy, gave off sparse lacing and had some staying power. Honestly doesn't look half bad.

Smell - Metallic, harsh boozy and grainy aromas. Vegetative mixture. Not much else. Saccharine sweetness. Could be worse.

Taste - And worse it gets. Boozy, artificial sweetness some metallicness going on. This is pretty harsh, not unlike the viking who is featured on the can's living conditions, a thousand years ago. Worse as it warms and the more you drink of it.

Mouthfeel - Rough, boozy, finish is too sticky.

Overall - Better than the first time I had it, but that's not saying much. It is good for one thing... killing brain cells. Made it through halfway and dumped the rest, the calories and misery aren't worth it."

€3,99 @ Serways (Rasthaus Köschinger Forst Ost), Hepberg, DE

Look: Golden in color with fingerprint-through-the-glass clarity beneath a short head of bright white that hold briefly and then drops to a standard collar, but which also then continues to leave decent lacing behind.
Smell: The alcohol is clear as are some other esters due to a high fermentation. It's quite fruity with a lot of apple.
Taste: Unfortunately the flavor follows the aroma. The alcohol is too clear, and the fruitiness is too high - the label doesn't state whether it's an ale or a lager, but I'll assume it's a lager, and for that it's too rough. Even as an ale it's too rough. It's also sweetish and fruity, and only balanced by the alcohol and some limited bitterness. The finish is sweetish and dry at the same time (?) with the alcohol and stiff bitterness fighting off the residual malt.
Feel: Medium bodied and gently crisp.
Overall: Poorly brewed with flaws.

Such a strong beer in a tinnie that reassembled cheap cat food was not to be recommended. Oh dear."

Light-bodied, almost watery, with light bitterness, a dry finish, and a lingering note of tart apple cider on the palate. If you're a stickler for truth in advertising, you might want to pass on this one. That said, it is quite refreshing."
Worst,Good Ass Beer,1.32,"I can't give the taste of this ""beer"" a low enough ranking. This is worse than making a mixed drink out of boxer and natty light.

How to describe it... Imagine a bowl of rice krispies cereal. Except, you added waaaaaay too much sugar, and instead of milk, you decided to use seltzer water and vodka. That's about what this tastes like. It's absolutely vile. I would bet money that this doesn't actually have any hops in it. It's literally less than 0.1 IBU. because again, just like cereal, they just added sugar.

I feel like I should sue for false advertising because the side of the can says it was ""brewed"". There's no way this was brewed. this was made as part of MKULTRA; in which the punishment was having to drink this crap. They experimented for decades trying to find the worst tasting beer possible.


Of all the good beers I've tried, of all the bad beers I've tried: I've never once felt the need to make a review. This beer is just that bad. a cocktail of: literally any other beer+water+UV of any color+leaving it out in the sun for 5 hours would be better than this.

Again. I cannot reiterate how terrible this is.

edit: I'm almost serious. If I could have chosen a punishment for Jeffy Ep, where the choices were 1) forcibly shotgunning this beer, or 2) literally being skinned alive, I'd choose that he had to shotgun this beer. The pain and misery of even a single sip is undescribable.

I've had 2 of them now. Because I'm trying to determine all the ways in which it's terrible. It's like watching ""The Room"". You watch it once and determine it's terrible, but then you watch it again because it was sooooo bad that you need to confirm your sanity by confirming that it's really that bad. That it's worse than anything you've seen before. You need to be sure that you really *haven't* seen anything worse."

I like to make Black and Tans with my husband's stout, but couldn't find a light beer that I like (we live in a state is that mostly dry, so liquor stores are few and far between and expensive). Good Ass is light, refreshing, isn't hoppy and not tinny tasting like Bud or Miller. Doesn't take away from the taste of the stout either.

Worst,Good Ass Beer,2.74,"Never in my life have I seen such a tall head fall so fast. Almost overflowing to start, and then, within literal seconds, just nothing. No head at all. The body is pale yellow, almost straw colored, with full transparency. It looks like a beer, basically.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't think the aroma was pleasant. But it's in a sort of funky, weird way. It smells like a Best Buy. It's got clean aromas and plastic, like a new TV. Faintly trailing are DMS and corn.

I can't fault the flavor. Clean, floral, with some cracker and creamy corn. It's sort of like a Miller Lite but with more flavor. Dry grain finishes the profile. It has all of the aspects of the old fashioned Cream Ale down tight. Easy.

Feel is like water, only lightly carbonated. Only way you can tell it's beer is the slight drying on the palate afterwards.

Overall, for a light beer, it's decent. I was expecting way worse. 79 cents a can, well that seems about right. Try it if you haven't, you might like it, but if you don't then chances are you didn't spend much on it anyways."
Worst,Good Ass Beer,3.08,"Random code on the bottom of the can but no date.

Appearance: I've seen some clear beers in my time, but this thing is on a whole other level of translucent. Gold tint to it with basically no head. Just some white bubbling around the edges.

Aroma: Some malty/adjunct sweetness but that's about it. Not unpleasant.

Taste: The same sweetness from the aroma paired with a decent amount of clean hop bitterness. The description on their website claims that there are notes of ""Hop"" and ""Brown Ale"", which I'm guessing is the sweet, somewhat toffee-like flavor but it tastes more like the second runnings of a cream ale mash. Too smooth of a finish for the style. Aftertaste of some persisting sweetness. Decent flavor for 4.2% ABV and likely has a high FG.

Mouthfeel: Light in body but with a syrupy quality that makes me question the sessionability. Low carbonation for the style. The sweetness gets cloying very quickly.

Final Thoughts: For $5 or $6 bucks a six-pack it's not the worst deal, but spend another $3 or so and get a lager or pilsener made by one of your local breweries. Would I drink it again? Meh."
Worst,Good Ass Beer,1,Was given to me I'm assuming as a gag gift. Has a jackass on the can and I know why. Pours clear with a small hint of yellow. Smells like bud ice or old Milwaukee malt liquor.

Taste is sweet, earthy, a little boozy, some skunk. Mushrooms actually come to mind, though it's not a direct mapping. Second sip builds on the sweetness and skunkiness, the vague fruitiness seems more like rotting fruit or something (not in an overpoweringly bad way or anything, but not in a great way).

Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.36,"Pours golden yellow with a 1"" white head, which sticks around a bit. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is malty, corny, grassy, metallic.

Taste is sweetish, corn flakes, grass, metal,

Light to medium body, light carbonation. Sweet, metallic finish.

Better than expected. A bit on the sweet side."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.12,"L- Appealing gold body with nice white head. Slight lacing along the glass.
S- Faint alcohol on the nose. Not much else is coming through.
T- Sweet fruit, apricot comes to mind. Reminds me of a double IPA that was long lost at about a year old. Some medicine on the back end. It must be good for me.
F- Good mouth feel. Very acceptable.
O- Very first malt liquor that I have reviewed. And that makes it difficult to rate to style. Not even close to drain pour for me and I enjoyed this just as much or more than the ice beers that I have tried."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.14,"Clear, golden body; dense carbonation; thin, white head, lasting. Low-key smell; a bit grainy with a very noticeable sweetness; peach. So-so taste; grain-like base, biscuit; fairly heavy artificial sweetness; mild bitterness. Heavy body; mildly syrupy; light to moderate warmth on the palate; mildly sticky.

Well, this one is a 'one and done' kind of beer for me. It is drinkable although there is little appeal to me with any of its qualities. It hides it's relatively high ABV well, but the overall taste plainly lacks depth and character. Again, it's not a bad beer, but pretty forgettable if you're looking for something with memorable appeal.

Poured at 54 °F; MAR2822"
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.04,"Appearance: Typical of the style, a nice head forms on the pour and quickly dissipates.
leaves a little lace as the glass empties

Smell: Corn and bread like aroma, nothing herbal or indication of hops

Taste: The taste is crisp and less sweet than other US malt liquors I've tried and
loaded with adjunct corn flavor. nothing unpleasant and nothing to indicate the ABV

Mouthfeel: Seems just right for an AAL/Malt, just enough carbonation and light mouthfeel
to make an easy drinker

Overall: Not bad/kind of good. I wouldn't seek out again, but wouldn't turn down"
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.16,"Best By date of March 28, 2022.

Clear orangey-gold, with 1 1/2 fingers of quickly-dissipating pale tan head.

Smell is sweet grain, and a faint floral note. While the head was still extant, I briefly picked up a faint aroma of fruity/medicinal alcohol, as in cough syrup.

The feel is medium, with a sharp carbonation bite at the end. Leaves the front of the tongue feeling coated.

Overall this is OK, which far exceeded my expectations. After about 8 oz I was ready to give up on it, but it actually got better as it warmed, again surprising me. Still not sure I can finish 24 oz, but I'm at least willing to try. :P If you want a cheap buzz ($1.55/24 oz), that is tolerable to drink, this might be it. ;)"
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.06,"Appearance is all about that mass produced clear golden body and a quickly disappearing head.

I can't pick up too much of the aroma except for some wet cardboard and subtle sweetness and tart apple rind.

Taste is sweet malt a little hoppy bitterness and a super dry finish. The alcohol is hidden, but is definitely there.

Overall, there's not much here to keep ya coming back except it's a cheap malt liquor and it's pretty damn easy to drink."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.27,"L: clear gold with a hint of amber and a tall, but short lived head
S: the aromas sweet corn and toast
T: the taste is surprisingly okay. Sweet corn & corn syrup with a bit of stale biscuit. There is some sweet apple juice and a hint of honey all on top of a corn liquor
F: mildly carbonated and a little sticky sweet on the tongue, no need to force the swallow and there is a mild peppery alcohol burn left on your tongue
O: much better that I expected Steel Reserve reminds me more of an inexpensive ""imperial"" AAL than a cheap malt liquor. I'm not going to buy more, but I wouldn't turn down one if offered."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.35,"Pours clear bronze, with moderate effervescence, and a finger of creamy-looking, near-white head that’s very slightly yellowed. The head settles into a thin cap pretty quickly and leaves sheets of lacing.

The aroma is corn and malt forward from the start, and does have a certain smoothness to it. I do get a little chlorine / pool impression underneath though.

The taste is sweet up front leading straight through to a green apple finish. I really don’t pick out much more than that when served cold.

The distinguishing quality of the feel is prickly carbonation, which I view as positive attribute that adds to the beer’s quaffablity.

Overall, it’s a little sweet for my taste, but nothing awful. I think the alcohol is fairly well hidden, too."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.12,"I opened the bottle and it had a thin soapy, sudsy head forms on the top of the beer. I am consuming this from the bottle. The Steel Reserve is a dark golden color - the color of very dehydrated urine - essentially what I expect my urine to look like tomorrow morning after drinking this.

The aroma has more of a toasted, stale bread aroma with some light corn notes. Not as blatantly sweet as Mickeys, but there is still some sweetness to the aroma.

The taste on this is significantly sweeter - lots of malt, white bread, even a bit of honey. There are some light bitter hop notes. The overall impression is a of a stronger, very sweet AAL.

Feel is pretty drinkable, but there is a certain sweet heftiness to the beers. Mild carbonation."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.26,"From a 24oz can:

Appearance: Clear gold, big head.

Smell: Boozy, some sweetness, solvent.

Taste: Boozy, chemical/solvent note. Some fruitiness/acetalehyde/green apple “strong beer” flavor. Some bitterness in the finish.

Overall: Not terrible, but not too good either. To my palate, a lot of strong lagers/malt liquors get the green apple flavor that just doesn't appeal to me. This isn't too chemical-tasting, but does get worse as it warms up. Keep it really cold. A slight step up from the Camos and Evil Eyes of the malt liquor world."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.49,"24 oz. canned poured into Imperial pint glass.
Look: Light straw color, heavy carbonation, 3 1/2 finger head, dissolves into a thin layer. medium lacing
Smell: Strong and sweet malt.
Taste: Grains, sweet, low bitterness
Feel: Medium mouthfeel, excellent carbonation, dry finish
Overall: On the surface slightly better than average malt liquor. However, it made me sick afterwards so no buy again.
Pair with seafood, spicy food or fruit to enhance the sweetness."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),1.29,"I was drunk and down on my money... so you can see how I ""gravitated"" to this Malt Liquor in a 40oz bottle. I had the worst hang over ever. This beer smelled like old feet and socks. It tasted just as bad. If you only have 5$ and want to get trashed this is the poor man's hangover fuel."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3,"I have a philosophy that instead of acquiring a taste for high quality alcoholic beverages, it's better to do so with cheap, strong booze. It's so much less expensive. Steel Reserve fits the bill perfectly. It's pretty nasty at first, but you can get a taste for it. Too bad it's going out of production."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),3.68,"I'm 31, been having Steels since I was 22. Straight from Pabst to Steel. Can't complain. Two 24oz Steels and some hard cheddar cheese to balance the taste, it's an absolutely blissful night. 10 outta 10. Will continue to drink."
Worst,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),2.62,"Purchased from Exxon as a 24oz can for $1.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear gold with a minimal pale-white head that goes away almost instantly after the pour.
S - Ethanol and some variety of a sweet barley. Little hint of white bread crust.
T - Surprisingly well-balanced. Caramel, biscuit, and toast. Strong alcohol presence.
F - Medium carbonation, medium-light body. Refreshing.
O - All things considered, it's not bad. If there was a high-proof version of PBR or Coors, this would be it (although I'm pretty sure those already exist). This would be a great beer to pair with dollar store frozen pizza, or maybe as a hair-of-the-dog treatment for a tequila and vodka bender the night before. Probably won't buy it again, but I wouldn't turn one down."

A- pours a clear golden color with an initially thick, foamy head that recedes quickly to leave a thin layer with some lacing on the glass.

S- Primarily caramel and malt. Slight boozy and adjunct aromas present.

T- Sweet corn with notes of malt and caramel. Noticeably sweeter than the Triple Export; can be overbearing if consumed too quickly.

M- Somewhat syrupy and heavy, but goes down smoothly for the ABV. Medium-high carbonation.

O- A serviceable high gravity malt liquor. There are better brews out there, both within the style and otherwise, but it'll get the job done. Tick complete."

Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1,"My friends and I were camping, and we were on a budget, we saw a 30 pack cans of this for $8.99 it was rape, via beverage. The beer looked cheap, it smelled awful, and it tasted worse. It felt like a dead orphan. This was by far the worst beer any of us had ever experienced. It was so bad we decided rather than drinking it, we would use it as target practice. The ammo cost more than the beer. It was the best use of ammo in human history. Forget Gettysburg. I never thought I would shoot unopened beer cans, but it was a joyful catharsis. Our souls were cleansed of that evil brew."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.6,"I feel that this is an underrated beer. Yes, is is one of those beers that one purchases when the budget is tight. However, that is what I like about it. When I want something that is highly drinkable and cheap, it is on my radar."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.53,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/10/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Thin but not too watery finish. Zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nice clean pale malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. Not too overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.83,"Great bear compared to others in it's similar category. Obviously, you're drinking this to save money and get a nice buzz. Easy to get down compared to other ice type beers (natty , keystone, regular Milwaukee)"
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.87,"12 oz undated can poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp. The beer is very pale golden straw colored with essentially no head or lacing. The aroma is a bit chemical but faint. Taste is predominantly bitter with no malt presence. Mouthfeel is sharply carbonated with a slight oily/soapy character typical of these beers. Overall, not good, but I've had worse. This can was $.63 as a single, so drink it ice cold from the can if you choose."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.57,"Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice has an initially medium, off-white head (which fizzes away, much more like a soft drink than a beer), a clear, somewhat bubbly, straw appearance, and no lacing left behind. The aroma is of wet straw, and the flavor is of cheap, store-brand grape drink, wet straw, green apple, with even a touch of hop bitterness at the back end. Mouthfeel is light, and Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice finishes semi-dry and unappealing. But, I was able to choke it down.

RJT"
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.02,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn, a bit of malts. Taste is mild malts, some plastics, kind of mild, flavorless yet unoffensive. Feels light in the mouth and overall, considering the low price point, is about what you can expect from this style."

I seen it in the store and figured id give it a try, especially for 2.50 a 6 pack. well the only good note is i had lacing in the glass. The head was thick but quickly went away, the smell is grainy and something old.."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.48,"Saw tall boys of this at the gas station for $0.99 and figured, why not? It's brownish gold with no head to speak of. and has an aroma of cooked vegetables and syrup. Tastes of corn, sugar and pepper. Reminds me a bit of diet ginger ale, only with a slight metallic taste. It is smooth and the flavor isn't offensive, but it isn't exactly something I want to keep drinking. It'd do in a pinch."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2,"A - Drank it straight from the can so I have no clue.

S - Rice adjunct, corn, alcohol.

T - Aluminum, strong stale rice adjunct, slight amounts of corn.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation.

O - Overall, For $1.19 a can it tastes exactly how you would expect it."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.08,"Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.

A: The beer is a light yellow color, with a short white head that fades quickly and leaves a decent lace on the glass.

S: The aroma is of adjuncts, grain, light malts and a faint touch of hops.

T: The taste starts bready with flavors of grain and adjuncts. Then a light malt sweetness comes in along with a hops presence that is mild even for the style. The after-taste is slightly sweet.

M: Crisp and a little smooth, light body, medium-to-high carbonation, finish is clean.

D: Not too flavorful, poundable and is not too filling since there's not a lot to the beer, mild kick, I've had worse but there are many other beers even within the style that I would pick first."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.08,"$0.50 can from Rudys in La Salle IL.

Pale gold, visible carb, and rapidly fading foam. A nest of bubbles sits atop a flaccid skim.

Smells like musty manila folders, apple juice, and airplane glue.

Flavor is dull and astringent, papery with grain and apple notes. Flabby feel with cereal grain and hard well water notes. Fusels give more than a hint of alcohol. A chore to drink. Chug ice cold or forget it."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.36,"WOO COLLEGE!!!!

A: Piss, if piss had bubbles. Clear golden, looks thin/watered down. White head recedes into flat nothingness.

S: Similar to other cheap brews, corn. Also a definite ethyl smell.

T: Woof. Well, it's liquid. Also a light grain taste. Also kind of tastes like someone put a few drops of grape soda and a few drops of vodka into it.

M: It is relatively smooth I guess.

D: It actually isnt that bad considering that it is dirt cheap and is going to get me hammered. Ok it is actually pretty bad, but the best strategy for this one is to just get it over with, drink it as fast as possible, preferably out of a funnel or with a big hole in the side of the can."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.29,"CAN you dig it? I pulled off a major trade in the Heinz Field parking lot a couple of weeks ago before watching Pitt lose (by a missed PAT!) to Cincy. I think that I developed a slight head cold during the snowy weather and so my reviews got put on hold until my sinuses cleared. Let the CAN Quest continue!

I came home this afternoon at the end of a looong ramp-up to the holidays and I wanted a beer real bad, so I thought that I would open a real bad beer (at least according to previous reviews and its overall score).

My pour created two fingers' worth of rocky, bubbly bone-white head that exploded with CO2 to the point that it fizzled itself out of existence. Once things settled in for the afternoon, I leaned in for a whiff. Do NOT try this without adult supervision present! Wow! It had a fusel alcohol burn accompanying a fruity sweetness and a cereal graininess. This was like Snapple's antithesis - made from the worst things on Earth. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity.

Things began to remind me of something else, like Pennsylvania Style Ice http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/782/52434 which was made by the same company! Say, who's zoomin' who here, boys? I truly believe that it was the same beer, but under different labels.

Mouthfeel was hot, with an alcohol burn that lingered well after the swallow. It was really unpleasant as a whole. It does not speak well when I have to nearly choke a beer down. I am simply glad that it remained cold during my review as I might have gagged otherwise.

MKE, PA feels your pain!"
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.39,"No ribbed can for me! I guess I get no added pleasure. (upping a pic soon)

Anyway, I was going to do some work on the car this evening and I know how much smoother things seem to go when you have a cold light beer by your side. I picked up a 30 pack for about $10 bucks.

This is very similar to most macro brew lagers. Light, clear, watery, easy drinking. What makes it diffrerent is a little more ""beer taste"" than many light beers and a high-alcohol-like sweetness.

Raw beer. Nothing special. You get what you pay for. Great value."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.96,"comes in a can with vertical ribbing down the side, for her pleasure, I presume, ""select select"" it says on top, with MSR interjected between, ensconsced in a gear-like design. Below that "" A fresh, Full-bodied Brew"", then bold-face MILWAUKEE, followed by slick cursive ""Special Reserve"", and a bolder ""ICE"", followed, finally by ""Premium Beer{, which, of course, means nothing. Besides the government and recycling alarms, there is no other information about the beer.

So, I will pop it and drink it.

I've never even heard of this beer before, but then, I don't often go prowling for it's like...still, here we are...clear, bare yellow color, slim, soongone head...not appealing...

Aroma: corn and little else...sorry, it's a null set that elicits no pleasure...not a whiff...

Taste: blah, blah, blah...wetness is the major caracteristic, followed by faint grain...and that's all...seriously.
Extremely light in body...nothing in the finish, just an avoidance of what's really a beer...that's what's sorely missing...oh, but wait, alcohol is knocking on the door to my medulla øblangata ...and I need a couple more to get seriously drunk and forget the mistakes I made in life, and may have to face tomorrow morning...my new favorite beer...hic! hup!

Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.68,"I always try to pick up a local brew, in addition to my craft beers, to support the local guys. The 30-pack of this ice beer I snagged looked to be interesting and it didn't disappoint. When first poured, the head rocketed into a fluffy foam, but quickly died back to a managable level. The first sniff gave off a sweetness that carried over to the taste and the body actually was pretty full! There was a bit of bitterness at the end, in spite of the flavor, but nothing to make me give up on it. This is by no means a top quality entry, but for the price, it's refreshing and friendly enough to keep around for a thirst quencher!"
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.46,"Went to beer store looking for a different ""spacer"" for Memorial Day weekend cookout. Poured a bright amber color with puffy white head. Smell was not impressive with sweet overtones. Taste was not enjoyable with excessive sweetness. Left a somewhat disgusting after taste in the mouth. Barely drinkable."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,1.22,"One of the worst beers I've ever had. I just moved into a house with some friends at the U of M and my roomate Adam needed beer but had no money so he bought this sorry excuse for a beer. He has been on a cheap beer binge. I had one and could not and would not finish it if you paid me. If you are looking for a cheap ice beer try Brew City Ice, which is probably made about a block away from the Special Reserve factory"
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.6,"Clear 40 oz. bottle (which was $1.49, and looked very out of place between a bottle of Old Crustacean and Hitachino Weizen). Anyways, this is a qualtiy 40 for the price. Clear gold color, witha big white head on top, after the pour. Smells a little of skunk, must, and corn, but not too bad. Flavors are not particularly appealing, but there is nothing too offensive or horrid. Could be a lot worse, and a pretty good bargain."
Worst,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,2.84,"A crystal clear golden body is topped by a short but creamy white head. Very fine bubbles rise in steady streams towards the surface, lending support to the fading head. It drops shortly to a decent collar and whispy surface covering; but also leaves some spotty lace throughout the glass. The nose displays sweet malt with a mild touch of vegetal character and an apple-like fruitiness. The body is surprisingly full, and quite creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor delivers the sweet malt and fruit that the nose promised, without defect. It's almost candyish in a way! There's certainly no hop flavor present; and the bitterness is at, or just below, threshold - but somehow it works! It finishes sweet with a residual fruity malt that dissipates shortly. I don't imagine that this is a very strong beer, but whatever alcohol is present is not noticeable. And as odd as it may sound, it's got a good drinkability - it's like drinking a gently fruity malt soda! Possibly good for SuperBowl parties... pairs well with extra hot Buffalo wings!"
Worst,Frio Light,2.12,"12 oz. can poured into Imperial pint class

Smell: Malty, nothing else
Taste: Slight sourness, not much malt, feels kinda metallic, expected watered down flavor
Feel: No much mouthfeel, about a half-second of bubble, alcoholic finish
Overall: Nothing stands out about this beer, other than the 75 cents I paid in the discount shelf. Will not get again.
Pair with, well I would suggest foods for a light lager, but since I don't want to drink this I would not pair food with it."
Worst,Frio Light,2.03,"Pours piss pale yellow with a decent two-finger white head that fades from the glass quickly. Smells of hay barn, corn funk, faint sweet grain maltiness. Taste is mainly corn, not a lot of flavor going on since it is a light lager. Light-bodied, high carbonation, smooth, crisp & oh so crushable... If your goal is getting tossed on the frio river, drinking copious amounts of light lager & forgetting where you are; then this beer is most certainly on your menu."
Worst,Frio Light,1.4,"Looks slightly darker gold than I expected. Not that it’s dark or anything close to it. There’s an unpleasant aroma, like wet cardboard and rotten wood.
The taste is not much better. I can’t really say it’s any worse than the uber popular MU. It has this weird grape koolaide flavor that is not something I want in a beer. It tastes like mineral water and cardboard, there’s no distinct hop or malt profile I can detect. That being said, I’m not planning on drinking them by themselves. I use cheap beers like this to mix micheladas with. It’s actually pretty good for that purpose, otherwise, it’s undrinkable."
Worst,Frio Light,2.65,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance- The beer pours a straw color with a small white head that fades very fast to leave almost no lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell - The aroma is of a off corny and cardboard smell mixed a little bit of light cracker smell.
Taste-The taste begins with a off light cracker malt and a bit of a cardboard taste that gets stronger as the taste advances. Toward the end of the taste an off metallic taste and some hay comes to the tongue and leaves one with a off taste to linger on the tongue
Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is light and the feel is very light. For the style the feel is good and makes for a quick sipper.
Overall - Ahh.. not too special here.."
Worst,Frio Light,2.95,"I've been famialir with this brew since it s inception, being carried e at our local HEB stores here in So. Cntrl. Tx.

When Frio Light first hit the shelves here, I bought a six pack of 16oz. of it, and it was amazing-it tasted like a poor mans Belgain Triple! Not too long after that I bought another 6 pack and it was flat out putrid and undrinkable. They seem to have stabilized the quality control of int to where it is generally a disagreeable pretty poor swill...that said, I really am of the firm opinion that QC , or more precisely the LACK of QC,is integral how this beer may present at any given point in time...I mean, with the more expensive American Adjunct Lagers you get precise consistent product. Case in point, I just bought a 30 pack of this Frio Light and it presented as a interesting AAL akin to a Pabst, or maybe the dregs of the barrels of some very good beer?
All that said, I think , and I am of the opinion that, when the beer travels all the way from where it is brewed in Memphis Tennessee by ""Quality Brewers""( that.s what the can says despite being said in the headliner of review page it is made in Wisconsin by "" City Brewing"") in hot truck (broiling hot actually in the summer), it can and will ruin the beer. Maybe tha's why the stuff I just bought here in December tastes pretty good, in fact, I rate it a solid 3 right now."
Worst,Frio Light,2.77,So this is a good cheap beer running about $20 for a 30 in texas. Tastes very similar the Coors Light and is a good going to a party budget buy. I have converted many to drinking this as their daily buy and they have a 6.0 option thats a little stronger but still good. All around a good beer for those that dont want to spend $10+ a bottle for micro brew.
Worst,Frio Light,1.54,"Appearance:
Pours to thin head that laces a bit. Pale clear straw color.

Aroma:
Smells of sweet syrup, candy corn, overripe pears and apples, and a hint of solvent. Very cheap smelling.

Flavor:
Flavor is just plain ""off""-- candylike and not very much like a real beer. Almost like a non-alcoholic brew, except you can detect the alcohol through the thin veil. Tastes of chemicals. Aftertaste liuke cheap waxy candy or artificial sweetner. Yuck.

Mouthfeel:
Light and bubbly. Moderate CO2 (about 2.5 volumes). No astringency. Watery but quenching.

Overall:
Tastes weird, not enjoyable. Even at the rock bottom low price point, it is pointless."
Worst,Frio Light,2.81,"Poured into a nonic pint glass.

Looks like a classic cartoonish beer with huge white sudsy head and clear golden body. Smells like damp corn husk, cardboard. Tastes fairly neutral with a little bit of corn adjunct and slight metallicism. Mouthfeel is light and fluid.

Overall, not spit-out bad, just plain and watery but not in a good way. If I want plain and watery in a good way I’ll drink Natty Light."
Worst,Frio Light,3.08,"I received this CAN from my local, in-person trader, tone77, who always come through with unexpected and surprising additions for The CANQuest (tm)! This is just one more exCANple of his ability to suss out new CANned beers.

From the CAN: ""American Brewed""; ""92 calories/2.8 carbs""; ""Premium Pilsner Brewed and Canned by Quality Brewers, Memphis, TN"".

I got some foaming through the vent when I initially Crack!ed it open, so I quickly CANmenced a Glug into the awaiting glass. Unbidden, it formed just under three fingers of foamy, fizzy, rocky, bone-white head with very limited retention, quickly falling to wisps & leaving only a trace of lacing behind. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an odd maltiness, not of an adjunct like corn, but instead almost like wheat, slightly honeyed. Hmm. I have smelled MUCH worse in/from the style. Remember to review to style, not to taste! Mouthfeel was thin & watery, about par for the course. The taste was really bland, barely registering as anything more than fizzy water. The site's style guidelines read: ""The hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma."" Agreed. It was pretty close to flavorless, but the smell was at least noticeable. It would be hard to rate it as ""Poor"" in that case. Finish was quite dry & refreshing, but it was a decent beer in a crappy style. I suppose that it would be nice on a hot, humid Summer's day, but then again, so would a glass of water. YMMV."
Worst,Frio Light,1.38,"Poured from a 12 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a crystal clear pale light yellow with an almost non-existent head. The aroma is basically tap water. The taste mirros the nose. it doesnt taste bad, but it doesn't taste like a regular beer. more like a flavored water or near beer."
Worst,Frio Light,2.39,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very light, hints of corn. Taste is nowhere to be found. Maybe the lightest grains, not much ""beer"" flavor at all. Feels light in the mouth and overall it just doesn't feel like I drank a beer."
Worst,Frio Light,5,"Good beer. Cheap as can be but you do not get the nasty taste like other cheap beers like Miller, Keystone, etc. You get what you pay for but with this low alcohol beer you can have it if you still have to drive home, tailgating, etc. It is a very smooth beer and very watery. Does not have a nasty taste because it does not have much of a taste at all. Would recommend this. Not quality but not terrible. Very good and highly drinkable beer."
Worst,Frio Light,1.94,"Frio Light has a thick, white head, a clear, very light straw, bubbly appearance, and pretty much no lacing left on the glass. The aroma is strong, right after the can is popped open. The smell is of an odd grape skin and some very thin grain odor. Taste is of faint grain and some background grape skin. Mouthfeel is light and watery. Frio Light finishes decently refreshing and dull. Overall, this is not too good. I would suggest avoiding it.

Worst,Frio Light,2.89,"16 fl oz silver aluminum can acquired at my local H-E-B grocery some weeks ago. Served into a Pinthouse Pizza branded conical pint glass in low altitude Austin, Texas. Expectations are below average. Reviewed live. Reviewed as a light/adjunct lager since the label identifies it as such. No ABV is listed on the label.

Per 12 fl oz: 92 calories. 2.8 carbs. 2.8g protein. .06g fat.

Served chilled. Side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated.

A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.

Pours a one figner wide head of off-white colour. Horrendously thin, without any cream at all, and stale looking. No lacing at all. Retention is average - about 2 minutes. The complexion sucks. So does the consistency, which is uneven. Not a frothy or appealing head.

Body colour is a clear pale yellow of average vibrance. Clean, without any visible yeast. Appears adequately carbonated.

Admittedly, it's pretty bland looking, albeit to-style. Standard fare for a light lager.

Sm: Cereals, blonde malts, corn adjunct, clean barley, a generic malty sweetness, and the slightest hint of floral hop character. The adjunct presence is obvious. It's a standard aroma for a light lager, and luckily doesn't have the sickening medicinal sweetness or stale feel of inferior light lager aromas. I'm apprehensive but optimistic. I'll add that it does smell mostly like beer, not like water. And that's an important distinction.

No yeast character or alcohol is detectable.

An inoffensive aroma of average strength.

T/Mf: Cereals, corn adjunct, clean barley, sweet generic maltiness, and generic floral hop character. The malty sweetness comes through more in the taste than it did in the aroma, but it's still not medicinal or cloying. And it does have body and weight; it's not watery bland crapola. The adjunct may bother some, but I don't mind it so much here.

Light, smooth, and wet. Lightly crisp. Overcarbonated. Decent thickness.

Not oily, astringent, gushed, hot, boozy, or harsh.

Very shallow depth of flavour. Low intensity of flavour. Below average duration of flavour. It's a very simple build, but it does have cohesion, and to a small extent balance. While you won't find any complexity, subtlety, intricacy, or nuance here whatsoever, it's got a likable simplicity and there's a fair amount of flavour here given that it's a light lager.

No yeast character or alcohol comes through.

Dr: It's a drinkable brew and I think it's better than many light/adjunct lagers at the same price point. Certainly, Frio Light is an easy target for reviewers, but I think we need to give credit where it's due and acknowledge that this beer accomplishes its (admittedly meagre) goals. It's what you expect it to be when you buy it. I wouldn't personally buy it again, but it has its merits and perhaps those on a diet who still want to drink beer would find it quenching. I think it's fair to say that it's a fairly refreshing brew and you could do worse for a beer pong* or student beer. At the end of the day, it's an average light lager. I can't fault it for its style.

Worst,Frio Light,1.51,"This beer was left at my house by a friend. I think as a prank. I was about to just toss it out then decided to just give it a go.

Incredibly yellow, with a white head that fizzes up then thins out quickly. That smell is its most defining characteristic. It smells like corn, corn and more corn. I don't mind corn. But not in beer.

The taste is more offensive the more you drink it. I gave it a 1.25 based on what it is lacking, but that seems generous after a few more sips. Up front it's watery, but the more I live with the taste in my mouth the more the it just makes me think of what it might be like to suck on a penny.

I do not care for the watery, fizz at all. I hate it. I hate it so much.

The rest of this is going down the drain."
Worst,Frio Light,1.03,"This is the absolute worst beer that I have ever tasted.

Poured a light, piss colored, see-through blond, with a white foamy, non-lasting head. It does have some lacing.

This smells like boiled potatoes, for crissake!

Taste is like water that has been mixed with a sir peary that went flat and skunky.

Not a hop to be had.... this is just aweful... a horrible beer-like fluid."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),4.26,"40oz'er

Clear pale yellow, lacing on the glass. Smells like sweet corn, dough, just slightly sour. Drinks surprisingly clean, just a faint aftertaste of garbage juice and booze, very mildly bitter. I plan on buying this one again"
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),2.75,"It's pretty average. Very light in color with minimal head. Slightly skunky, bready, non- offensive flavor. Quickly dissipating head, almost non- existent. Easily poundable and inexpensive, on sale, at 10 bucks a 12 pack at Fresco here in Central Florida. Overall, average AF to say the least, though drinkable and not undesirable. For a cheap summertime brew, not bad. Nice and light, with a SLIGHT bit of flavor and hugely refreshing. Although, I prefer Icehouse or Budweiser to this stuff, to be honest. Definitely not my weekend truck washing/ grass cutting beer, for sure, but I would take it over Natty Ice any day. Great brew to try out if you haven't already, but won't be rushing back for more. It's ok if ya get it on sale. Worth a shot."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),1.38,"Shared bottle at local tasting, as Famosa. Pale golden colour, low white head. Artificial and ""chemical"" sweetish / sourish aroma. Sourish flavour, otherwise bland as hell, dust, no bitterness"
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.73,"Funny that this is rated as awful. For what this is and the travel it goes through as well and the unique quality it has over other beers from its region make me question if reviewers are simply saying it's bad because it's not an imp stout or ipa.

It looks like every other adjunct lager yes. But the smells are spicy and herbal underlying beneath a cracker base. The flavor follows the nose and is pretty unique given the region and style it comes from as previously stated. The feel is light enough and inoffensive.

If you are comparing this beer to American craft beers then you're doing it wrong. If all you drink is a Dipa then why even bother with this. From a point of view of this that's why I believe the rating is low. If you like clean lagers then this is a great beer."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.65,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear light straw color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving a tiny bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heaviest of a doughty and caramel smell. There is an odd, salty almost meaty like aroma to the brew as well. At the same time there is a touch of bread and some light must.
Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker and caramel malt flavor mixed with a touch of graininess and some light hay. As the taste advances, the graininess increases and is joined by some very light lime like tastes. Toward the very end the sweetness increases a touch and with a bit of herbal flavor, one is left with a crisp, slightly sweeter, lager taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin and crisp with a carbonation level that is average to slightly higher. For the style and the abv. the feel is great and makes for a nice crisp sipper.
Overall – A nice crisp “Mexican” actually Guatamalan style lager. Very easy drinking."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3,"Doesn’t blow you away in any category, but very few pilsners do. It’s super light in body & flavor, probably a good substitute for water when it’s hotter than hell in Guatemala. Tastes a little sweet when poured into a glass and is most refreshing straight out of the can."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.23,"There is no date on the bottle. The pour is straw colored. The taste is grains, malt, with a touch of hops. I'm not getting any corn syrup in this beer, I would drink this again. I highly recommend this beer if you can get a hold of it, it's easy drinking & sessionable. Oh well, at least now I can say that I've had a beer from Guatemala & it was good. Cheers! B-"
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),2.6,"Well, first up: it’s better than jail hooch. But nah, it actually ain’t that bad. It definitly is one of the most clear beers I have ever seen - I mean, this thing is more transparent than Trump’s brainwaves. Taste is here and there. Bad, but not all that bad (like Raul’s first sexual experience). I mean, I’ll drink it and high five my friends after - but greener pastures in the future are in-store.

Yep!"
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.76,"(1000 ml bottle - though it says 1 qt 1.8 oz on the label... no bottle coding... purchased cold... poured into a liter Maßkrug)

L: crystal-clear, pale yellow-gold liquid; stupid amount of frothy, rocky white foam, as if this is over-carbonated or expired; loose honeycomb of bubbles on the sides, but beautifully craggy, tight cottony head in the middle... hmm, looks dreamy; Himalayan lace

S: almost smells skunked(?!), but also smells like a junk, dusty German pils (a la Bitburger?)... it gets more pleasant as it goes, almost like honey atop cream of wheat... overall intensity is mellow yet has relative depth

T: ultra-dry, cereal meal malt base; the finish does a relative 180, shifting to a restrained herbal-grassy bitter bite, as well as vague nutty-nougat malt; the combo of the grain and green lend a peculiar earthy color, perhaps like woolen upholstery??... it stays rather dry throughout, but the malt does tease with a faint honey sweetness... as it goes, it does improve (it's gotta breathe); the malt and perfumy phenolic aftertaste is rather Euro pale

F: slow flow and finish, though cut dry at the bottom and back... the warmth lingering may in part be the bitterness and/or smoky phenols

O: perhaps reminds me of Tsingtao maybe?; at any rate, definitely more akin to a Euro pale than AAL; grew on me along the way... had to get this bottle for its novelty gargantuan size - the empty bottle itself feels almost as heavy as a six-pack (of full cans)... I could see grabbing this again, especially in the liter bottle; funny conversation piece (1466)"

A: Pours a crystal clear, dark straw color with less than one finger head formation, spotty retention, but partial rings lacing.
S: Aromas of corn, caramel, and grasses predominate the nose.
T: Semidry. Palate follows the nose, but slightly grainy. Light bitterness contributes a very clean finish.
M: Light bodied with low effervescence.
O: A nicely constructed AAL. Drinkable and very enjoyable."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.37,"12 fl oz cans run $7.49 USD per sixer at some grocers in Austin, TX.


""Lager beer."" ""Contains sulfites.""

Pours a dull depleted yellow body. Clear/obviously filtered, but lifeless.

Head is thin and a bit weaky, but pleasantly fluffy.

AROMA: Mineral water, faint 6-row, obvious maize, a hint of starchy grassy hop character. Marries its adjunct to the rest of its profile decently, but the corn would be obvious even in a blind tasting. Suggests a skullable neutral lager with an inoffensive taste.

TASTE: Pleasant 6-row and corn sweetness is the name of the game in this simple lager, but a bit of fringe grassiness from limited hopping does surface as well.

TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, clean, refreshing, and approachable. Light-bodied. To give it credit, it's not a watery or syrupy brew like so many budget lagers. A little soft. Its texture is probably the best executed aspect of it.

OVERALL: A step up from most adjunct lagers and Euro pale lagers out there, with a refreshing taste and enough flavour to make it worth pairing spicy food with. Would make a nice table beer not to think too much about, but it's not worth seeking out. Within the style, it's generally well-executed. I could pound a sixer in a sitting.

B- / WORTHY"
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),2.79,"Quart+1.8oz (that's a liter in metric) bottle poured into 14oz teku. Poured a very hazy uric yellow with over an inch of white head that moderate retention and light lacing.

The aroma was low grain, low hopped, and a lot of skunk, despite the brown bottle.

The flavor was a big step-up, the skunk was almost non-existant, the grains had a gentle background, and there was a touch of floral hops.

The body was light, crisp, smooth, almost refreshing (and probably would be in a humid or beach side environment), and finished much drier than I anticipated.

Drinkability was fine, I knocked off that bottle with no problem. Overall, about what I expected when I grabbed this $4 quart+. If ya don't try it, you're not missing anything. But, if you're on the lookout for a lawnmower/beach/river/lake/chore beer, ya could do worse."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),2.38,"From a bottle. Pale golden color with fluffy white head. Sweet malt and straw smell. Light feel. Sweet malt flavor with just a hint of floral hops. Just your standard AAL, nothing really stands out. A way to check Guatemala off your list, but that's about all to recommend it."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),2.92,"Poor perhaps, but certainly not as poor as these average ratings.
Let's not have high expectations for this beer. It is made to be refreshing in a tropical climate. If it is expected to go with the native kitchen, it is somewhat spicy which requires a modestly soothing beer... which Famosa is. And the brewer has been in business for 125 years in a small country, which means (to my cynical mind) that the brewer is in tight with the powers-that-be and doesn't have too much competition... and so doesn't have to get better.

As for Famosa, it does not have good Looks. It Smells better as I get mostly malt. Tastes are balanced by hops. It finishes clean and refreshing, tho not full.

Would I have it again? Well, I have no choice. I bought a sixer. Maybe I should become a trader. I am nonetheless glad to add another country to my list... and move on."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.18,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into glass. Undecipherable stamping on bottle neck.
Clear, straw colored body. Half a finger of white head upon pouring, which eventually disappeared. No lacing.
The skunky aroma was immediately apparent upon opening, which is unfortunate because the real beer smells show sweet malts and spicy hops.
Taste is also skunky, but there is a sweetness to the malts and a spiciness to the hops that is not generally found in ""Mexican"" lager beers.
Thin to medium mouth feel. Good carbonation. Besides the skunk, this beer is more refreshing than smooth.
I liked the heightened flavors of sweet malts and of spicy hops. If I can find this beer in the can, I will try again and report back."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),3.16,"$ 2.13 (Including tax)/12 oz can ($ 0.177/oz) from World Market, The Forum, Live Oak, TX. Reviewed 11/17/18.
“XF WB XH C 1412 XF WB XI”” on can bottom. On shelf in the store. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 4.
Body – Light yellow, clear, very slight effervescence.
Head – Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white, medium density, good retention, diminishing to a four to seven mm ring slightly fed by effervescence and a thin complete layer. Head retraction leaves a few small islands of tiny bubbles and a nearly complete ring of thin lacing.
Lacing – Very good. Volume reduction leaves a wide raggedy band of tiny bubbles with stalactites and connecting columns to the next band.
First pour – Light yellow, nearly colorless, clear.
Aroma – 3 – Dimethysulfide.
Flavor – 3 - Not much. Some corn and a very slight bitterness. No alcohol (5 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 3 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 3.25 – Very much better than expected. Lacks the skunkiness of mercaptans which I expected. Seems a little less crisp than US AALs but otherwise very drinkable. I can definitely see this being desirable when working or eating in the Yucatan or southward area."
Worst,Famosa (Gallo),1.75,"Easily the worst beer I've had. I've only had it direct from the bottle so I can't judge the look. The taste is where it really gets bad. It felt like an alcohol-free malt drink. No personality, no good malt flavor, no bold colorful hops. Horrible aftertaste."
Worst,Amstel Light,3.64,"Pours a pale straw color with a quick receding white head, Smell is basically earthy grains. Taste is light maltiness with a nice crisp hop bite. Feel is crisp and refreshing, light bodied, finishes semi dry. Overall for a light beer this is not bad at all. It is thin and lacking flavor,(but we are talking about basically a 3/2 beer) For what it is the ratings do not reflect the quality. High ABV stouts (even crappy ones) get above a 4 if the ABV is Above an eight. I am judging this for what it is. A weak,3/2 beer."
Worst,Amstel Light,3.24,"L - Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a half fingers of light off white head on an aggressive pour. Fades to a lightly foamy film. Lacing shows on agitation, but quickly returns to liquid. Lots of carbonation showing from the nucleation in the glass that is easy to see through the clear light straw color.

S - Honey and crackers up front. And that's really it.

T - Sweet honey and bready cracker taste follows scent. Maybe even some hints of cornbread. Very very minor crispness in the middle, but really muted and fades fast. The sweetness of the flavor is pleasant, and not skunky at all like some other reviewers have experienced. No real bitterness to speak of.

F - Thin mouthfeel like other light beers, but not total water. A nice amount of minor carbonation. Very easy to drink

O - Overall, this is one of the better mass produced light beers I’ve tried. It actually has a palatable and pleasant (if not straightforward) flavor profile. At this time, I’m not normally reaching for light beers, but if I had to choose a light beer, this would be the choice for now. Perfectly refreshing for outdoors and camping. Recommended for those seeking a mass produced light beer other than the big three American labels."
Worst,Amstel Light,3.23,"Look: Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a one finger soapy white head. Head lasts for about two minutes before fizzling away.

Aroma: Clean notes of cornbread and very, very light notes of spicy noble hops.

Taste: Sweet and mild. The flavor follows the nose, mostly just flavors of sweet corn, white bread. It ends on very gentle flavors of slightly spicy, floral hops. No off metallic or sour flavors. Not watery.

Feel: Very light and bubbly, but not seltzer or soda like. The sugar profile gives it some body.

Overall: For a light beer, it's pleasant enough. The flavor is very light and what little flavor it does bring to the table doesn't offend the palate. For a cheap beer it's alright."

F: Crisp with a fast finish, it has a substantially clean, crisp light-bodied mouthfeel with a fast and essentially non-drying finish. It is moderately thin with an airy hop presence and a light malt backbone.
O: I first tried this beer in 1986. This is one of the easiest drinking purpose-built LIGHT BEERS on the market. A tasty imported lager with no fruit or yeast flavors, just clean lager. Plenty of class for a light beer and it is excellent in it's style."

This is even skunkier than the Stella I had before it, which was surprising enough to me to begin with, at least for a beer I thought I was more familiar with. But here is an even lower quality macro, with a sort of cigarette accent underneath a dry, brown Melba toast-like malt.

The medium-light body has a mild crispness and finishes dry."

The beer is almost crystal clear with a hue of bright amber. There's no head, nor lacing to mention. The smell started a little skunky that's the norm for many a European lager, then drifts to bread-like sweetness. There is ample carbonation. The taste is lightly sweet, with just a little hoppiness to the finish. It isn’t much, but it does make the initial sweetness more tolerable. Unfortunately, the body and mouthfeel are like water. A little tastier than some Light Beers it is, but still unsatisfying."
Worst,Amstel Light,2.63,"Need an evening starter? Well take notes. Ask the bartender for a Deer and Beer and make sure its an Amstel Light. What better combo than a 3.5% beer to go along with your jagermeister shot to ensure you will kickstart your night without overdoing it. Amstel Light actually has more color to it than many light beers, leaning more to a amber than the transparent golden liquid of most light beers. Taste-wise you get that classic euro-skunk taste followed by a malty breaded taste that is missing from most corn juice tasting light beers. Not much of a smell to it, just a classic beery smell, but boy does it go down. The perfect companion to the stag labeled green bottle liquor."
Worst,Amstel Light,3,"This one hit me well and good like Agassi serving an ace and nailing a line judge in the junk. Nothing special, but it did the trick like the first time I saw Miranda Kerr in a Victoria’s Secret catalogue.

Worst,Amstel Light,4.1,I am very disappointed that Beer Advocate gave this beer a Score of 59. Well it deserves a better score than that more like an average or a overall score of 90. Just my thoughts.
Worst,Amstel Light,4.88,"Maybe one of the best Light Beers you can get.
Starting with the looks. poured into a Tulip glass, Bright and clear appearance. larger bubbles stick to the side while small champagne bubbles drift to the top. Beautiful Pilsner Color. Yellowish Golden. Minimal to no cap until swirled, Resulting in a thin head. Lacing is nice as it sticks to the glass. Moving along to Smell. The aroma is typical pilsner eske. Rich Malty Euro lager smell, herbal somewhat buttery and roasted nutty aroma. Now talking about taste. This is where the rubber meets the road. First impression I get is Clean Water. Subdued character with no Malt sweetness. As the flavor builds, you get a light pilsner malt. A little old fashioned bread, Buttery, lightly roasted herbal quality. the finish is a kiss of hops. Very clean with a slight woody undertone. Throughout the beer, there is a constant reminder this is a light beer. everything is toned down and muted. As for feel. Very thin, watery and not silky or creamy. I'v found this to be a theme with some european lagers. So not really a point of contention. Overall, Good, Enjoyable Light Beer. There is always a time and place for any beer. I imagine this beer would make a great companion with some deli finger food."

T: all of those aromas are pretty much exactly what I get on the palate, with the malt of course opening up, taking over the flavors... bit of back end grassy bitterness and perhaps a hint of toasty smoke that helps establish a little balance and depth

F: medium-bodied, a bit sluggish flowing through, but ends with a nice tickle of carbonation, giving way to the soft stunning hum of hop bitterness... about standard for its ilk

Looks appealing for what it is, but its overall appearance isn't standout.

AROMA: Sweet adjunct-like notes. Malt extract. 6-row...smells like a maltster floor. I don't find much hopwise...maybe a scintilla of Noble hop grassiness if I really look for it, expecting it to be there.

Aromatic intensity is medium-high.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Drinks clean and easily aided by crisp carbonation and a smooth wet mouthfeel. Clean 6-row and malt extract up front with a big fresh malt finish. Simplistic, sure, but it's also balanced. I do get hints of buttery and metallic notes, but they're barely noticeable. A bit of green apple skin in the third act.

Light-bodied and very approachable. Has more depth of flavour than many full strength beers I've tried, and it has more authentic flavours than a lot of the flavored ales sitting on shelves across the U.S. and Scandinavia.

OVERALL: A very refreshing well-brewed clean drinking lager with a simple but enjoyable malty flavour profile. One of the better low alcohol beers I've tried.

C+ (3.19) / ABOVE AVERAGE"
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,1.76,"Looks great, light gold with a white, creamy head. Smell is somewhat muted. Taste was so disappointing, basically tastes like cereal, reminded me of cornflakes. Does not remotely taste like beer. Very sweet and watery. I can only describe it as liquid cornflakes. Gross"
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,5,"St. Pauli Girl's NA is the ""gold standard"" by which I measure all other NAs. Though I am not such a connoisseur as to typically rate the ""look"" or ""feel"" of a beer, there is nothing I love more than the skunky smell of a good German beer--and nobody does it better than St. Pauli Girl! This is the beer that never lets me down, that never fails to elicit waves of joy upon sight, smell, taste, and after-effect.
Though as an alcohol drinker I became a devoté of Guinness Stout and the bitters, pilsners, and ""black and tans"" of the British pubs, I have always loved and preferred the smell of a good skunky beer like Heineken, Beck's, and St. Pauli Girl. The effect of those smells are Pavlovian as my earliest exposure to beers were in the company of my grandfather and great grandfather who were true devotés to all-things German--including their beers.
I look forward, through this site, to exploring NA beers as-yet unfamiliar to me. I am open to suggestions but be forewarned: I am VERY biased toward my skunky beer!"
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,3.46,"Minor froth and pale for a lager, what is lacking in first impression is compensated for in taste and a crisp, refreshing finish. For non-alcoholic, I don't think there are many that come close. It's actually much better than a lot of regular beers. Think spring or summer, then grab a St. Paul NA to feel refresh without getting wasted."
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,4.81,"This is the most real beer tasting na beer I've had, I know one thing the Germans know how to make beer and they make a great na beer too , I poured it into a plisner glass from a 12oz bottle has a golden color,and about a2 inch foamy white head, tastes like a real st pauli girl , so you haters gonna hate, but it's a really good beer"
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,3.46,"Pours a straw color with a slight foggy tint to it. Head formation is around a finger in height and stark white in color. Aroma is dank hops, pilsner malts, and straw. Flavor profile is more pilsner malts with a straw taste in the background. Dank hops come in about midway through, with the finish of the beer being rather yeasty and clean. Mouth feel is medium-thin with a velvety, crisp feel. Overall, notes of beer, but without the alcohol. It drinks with some presence despite being a non alcohol lager.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle."
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,1.9,"Pours a very clear very light golden color. White head. Somewhat frothy. Retention is actually good.
The nose is quite skunky. Somewhat outputting.
Taste - skunky tasting. There's an artificial flavor to this almost. I do get a slight malt, but the skunk really is strong.
Watery! And the skunk does linger, which is outputting.
I got this for the tick. Would never drink otherwise. Just bad."
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,2.04,"I do not like fruity beer. If you do, you may strongly disagree with me on this review. But as somebody who does not like alcoholic fruity beer, this one has shown me I don't like fruity non-alcoholic beer as well.

Look:
Like weak beer.

Smell:
Like oranges. Actually smells pretty great.

Taste:
Way too sweet. I didn't even finish the bottle.

Feel:
Not sure, the taste was too overwhelming.

Overall:
If you like fruity beer, maybe give this one a try. If not, steer clear. It's like fruity beer, but worse."
Worst,St. Pauli N. A.,3.53,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 7/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Good aromas with bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Bit of cardboard from the NA process in aromas/flavors, but not overwhelming. Nice robustness and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp balanced mouthfeel that is good. A bit rough, but easy drinking. Overall this is a pretty good NA pale lager. All around good robustness and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. Very flavorful and not watery. Tastes very similar to the other NA beers I've had before. I've gotten used to the flavor, so if you can get past the cardboard thing they all have, they are enjoyable."
Worst,Skol,1.72,"Carbonatación media. Cuerpo extremadamente ligero. Una cerveza acuosa, dulce, casi sin rastros de amargor. Sería como la cerveza Corona pero de Brasil."

Worst,Skol,2.64,"I had this beer at the airport in Sao Paulo. From a can, the beer is a light, american-style lager. Smells of corn, a bit of grass. Lightly sweet, and grainy. Not as dry as many of the style, but not very interesting. Simple, straightforward, and uninteresting."
Worst,Skol,2.5,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has slight malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Skol,2.47,"Looks and smells like your average new world pilsner lager. Golden in colour with light lacing. Aroma has a corn smell which creeps through in the taste. Ice cold on a hot day this beer can be acceptable if the price is right. Otherwise, spend a little extra and buy something else."
Worst,Skol,2.84,"This is available all over the Atlantic coast of Brazil. When it's cold, it suffices. But if you let it warm up, you'll regret it. It has no redeeming qualities so to speak, it's just available everywhere."
Worst,Skol,1.93,"Found an old notebook today while cleaning up my office that had a list of reviews.

Beer pours a light gold very similar to the color to Bud Light. Smell is similar, corn, pilsner-esque. Somewhat refreshing on a warm day but like most adjuncts not something special.

I drank the whole can but not something I would have after another even if the only choice."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.28,"16 oz draft pour at a Twins game. I was intrigued by the first sip, which showed this beer is more flavorful than and superior to Bud Light. However, a few sips in my interest dropped to near zero. Ultimately it's still a watery light beer with hints of barley malt. And maybe hops. Maybe not. Who can say?"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.48,"16oz aluminum can purchased at Busch Stadium and consumed from the bottle. Smells vaguely beery. The taste is very light malt, a hint of orchard fruit and lightly tart. No real bitterness or hop presence. Very light bodied with high carbonation and a mostly dry, fairly clean finish. Overall, ok, but I'd rather have bought a 30 pack of Hamm's for the money..."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.25,"My second favorite light beer. Beats out Natural Light (my #3) for better body and smoother finish in my opion. Beats Miller, Coors and Bud lights hands down. For the record Lienenkugals Light is my #1."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.84,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light, pale golden color with a mild white head. SRM of 5-6. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild to moderate aromas of pale malts, white bread, malts, some white adjuncts on teh finish, but has a full-bodied aroma.

Flavor: Mild flavors of pale malts, white cracker, lots of yeast. A smooth light honey malt sweetness on the end, but also finishes dry. Finishes smooth.

Feel: Medium to light bodied. Strong carbonation, A smooth malt sweetness on the end.

Compared to Miller Light 7/29/21: Pours a slighty lighter color. More cracker and dry yeast aromas. Less corn and adjunct malts. Dryer, and cleaner.

Overall: Better than I expected for a light adjunct lager. This one drinks with a nice balance of carbonation, yeast, and sweet malts on the finish. A pretty nice light beer. Hard to beat Miller Light in a beer contest, but this one was pretty good. (Final Rating: 3.84)"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.6,Pours a clear light golden yellow color. Smell is grain and barley wth some malts. Taste has slight hops with some grassy notes cracker bread malts . Mouth feel is crisp and refreshing its an AAL so to style very tasty crisp and drinkable .
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.7,"Light straw. Smallest hint of light malt on the nose. Same in the flavor. Wow, that's a boring beer. Slightest spice. Technically refreshing but so is water."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.2,"Poured from can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer is pours a light golden color with a billowy white head of fizzy foam. The head fades very fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the beer is light overall, but consists of some cracker and bread as well as a bit of corn and caramel sweetness. There is a little bit of light hop as well as some light papery aromas.

Taste – The taste begins light and crisp with a cracker and lightly corn and caramel sweetened taste. The tastes are light upfront (appropriate for a light brew) and continue so throughout. There is a little loss of sweetness as the taste advances and along with some increases in a grassy hop and a little bit of grainy malt flavor, one is left with a light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is high. For the light brew style the feel is great and makes this an easy drinking session style brew overall.

Overall – For the style this is a rather decent light adjunct. Not super flavorful, but low cal, easy drinking, crisp, and sessionable."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,1.7,"Smells distractingly of moscato and tennis balls. Looks like pale clear straw, no head. Tastes like sparkling water. This is why you never drink light beer."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,3.35,"Appearance
Medium straw yellow, one finger head, no head retention

Aroma
Faint aroma of pale malt and grassy hops. Clean and inoffensive

Flavor
Light, clean grains, slight maltiness. Not much hop character to speak of. Seltzer finish

Mouthfeel
Very light and fizzy. Thirst quenching

Overall
What Bud Light wants to be when it grows up; A more nuanced version of an Anheuser-Busch rice-containing light domestic lager"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.95,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The white can doesn't do it for me, and the logo using a different font for each word seems too hodgepodged.

Smell - A slight sweetness on a distant wind. Typical light beer smell.

Taste - A little dirtier and more bitter than I usually expect from a light beer. Not that bad.

Feel - Thin body, heavy carbonation. What else would you expect?

Overall - I'll admit, I'm a Miller person normally when it comes to light beer, but this one is up there. Far better than Bud, Coors, and Busch."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,2.89,"Poured cold from 16-ounce aluminum bottle into a vintage lager flute. Crystal clear pale yellow in color, with a white head that disappeared after only a couple of seconds. Light malts on the nose and palate, with grassy and herbal notes and a little tart cider as it warms. Light in body, good carbonation, crisp finish. Not the worst light lager out there by any means. This has a bit of old-world character that makes it a decent food beer."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.5,"Michelob Golden Draft Light | Anheuser-Busch. Poured from the can into a pint glass, this brew's got a two finger thick head, spotty lacing, and a clear light gold body.

Smells like mellower grains and malts.

I taste full-bodied malts and grains, but its pretty light and smooth going down.

Light mouthfeel with mild carbonation.

I'll give Michelob Golden Draft Light | Anheuser-Busch a 4.5. Much more flavorful 99% of light beers I've tried."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft Light,4.51,"Michelob Golden Draft Light brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.10% This brew pours out a nice Light golden amber color with a small white head. Really spotty lacing to this brew, it does stick to the glass. The smell is rich with grains and malts. There are also some faint hops in the smell of this brew. It has the smell of most American light Lager brews on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is rich and strong with flavors. I really enjoy the flavors in this brew. For being a light brew, it has some balls behind it. Reminds me of a regular brew more than a light brew. You pick up on some nice smooth grians and malts in the taste of this brew. For being a light brew, it has a lot going for it. To me this is what Light brew should taste like. This is a nice bold light bodied brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Michelob Golden Draft Light a 4.50 out 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the chance to. This is one of Anheuser-Busch, best keep brews. If you get a chance to try this brew, look it up and review it as an light brew. This brew is in a limited market you can not get anywhere...
Thank you Anheuser-Busch"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.22,"Pabst Blue Ribbon. One of the most cheapest and popular beer on the market.

You have that corny smell. The smell is not offensive.

The taste is like the smell. But on the finish it's terrible. And the after taste is not that great at all. Maybe is because of the agent than sleeman put in their pabst but hey it's drinkable and this is one of the best economic beer on the market.

Would I recommend it ? Sure, for the price u can t go wrong with that.

Would I buy it again ? NO"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3,"L: Transparent yellow, no bubbles or head.
S: Semi sweet and alcoholic grainy corn and skunky apple lager notes
T: Similar to the smell. It's not overly sweet and it is somewhat flavorful although it's not the best tasting. The taste leans towards the warm malts with some skunky hoppiness. Not very bitter or drying.
F: Medium body, a bit foamy feeling, little carbonation.
O: Not as good as I remember but not bad. Probably better with food than drunk alone."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.15,"First time I tried this Canadian version and the only reason was it was made by Sleeman...poured a clear pale gold with a 2 finger puffy white cap that lasta....aromas are demure bready malts, some grassiness...flavor is rounded and malty with enough hopping to balance clean drty finish from brewer's rice, hops become more evident....bready taste at the end...actually a very decent pre-prohibion American lager, malty, dry enough hops to be balanced, quenching...no down side here"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.64,"I have had this in bottles and cans, but I'm basing this review of when I had it on tap, which is my most recent tasting of the brew. It's good for a low-budget AAL, and is nicely carbonated, and was very crushable on a night out. I love my craft beers, Trappist beers, many different beers, but I judge beers by type. I'm not comparing it to a St Bernardus Abt 12, that would make no sense at all. I like it much better than Coors light or Molson Canadian, which are the usual beers on tap at the karaoke bars here. In the can, PBR is not very good though."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.29,"Have drank this stuff many times and I never really liked it much. It's an ehh beer, tastes ehh, looks ehh, feels ehh.
Been around forever, and I even have a friend who swears by this beer. I prefer to swear at it."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),4.18,"It is an amazing cheap beer. Sure its not premium beer, but for the price, you can't go wrong. It pours about 2 fingers thick with a fast fading head. Smells like a sweet, malty, hoppy beer. I swear I thought I smelled apples for a split.. ""macro"".. second. lol. It's kinda like how you wish Budweiser tasted like. Its got a sweet taste, again, I almost think of apples even tho its clearly not in the taste pallet but still... You can taste the hops or grains for sure so that ads to the authenticity of the lager. A surprisingly nice amount of carbonation and might be too much for some though, as I hate micro lagers (they remind me of fizzy pop bleck!) Very smooth going down and can easily drink 6 cans without a problem but, then be in a problem cause I've just pugged 6 cans of some good brew and might need to take a walk and have a cup of coffee. Leaves a slight bitter aftertaste but nothing special. For the price this beer is friggen good."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.49,"Overall, the best bottom-shelf AAL that is widely available, hands down. There are others that I like better, but are hard to find or overpriced. Can't go wrong with PBR"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3,"Light bodied and pale lager, a popular macro-brew.
Low bitterness, thin maltiness, moderate alcohol (solvent taste from a can)
Flavor cut and with adjunct cereal grains.
Worth drinking, but not worth making much effort to acquire either."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),2.5,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing

A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.14,"There's a time and a place for every beer, and I'll always have a soft spot for PBR. I'm overrating it, and I'm aware I'm overrating it, but it's just way too tied up in good times, good friends, great nights.

It's inoffensive, refreshing, and tastes better than it has to. In terms of low-cost options in the Canadian brewing sector, I really can't fault it. But there's no sense pouring it into a glass, and there's no sense drinking it anything less than absolutely ice-cold."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon (Canada),3.38,One of the few macros I enjoy. Helped me through culinary school thats for sure. Nothing in the tadte is offensive but nothing is particularly outstanding. I still crack a can open from time to time.
Worst,Max,2.52,"From a can purchased in Seoul. Golden color with white head. Sweet grain smell. Light body. Tastes like it smells, sweet grain with some corn and earthiness. Below average, but drinkable enough. Makes me think the other reviews are a freshness issue."
Worst,Max,1.06,"I got Max at the Korean Air lounge in the Incheon International Airport.

It was from a machine where you place the glass and it tilts and pours for you. The color was a urine-yellow, and the head almost felt coarse. The whole time I was drinking Max, I felt like I was drinking metal. There was an overarching metallic smell and flavor that took away everything else from a forgettable experience."
Worst,Max,1.89,"11.13(?)oz bottle purchased at the north Spokane Total Wine for a price I forget. I purchased this solely as a ticker beer, as I'd never had a Korean beer before. I didn't notice the ""04032013"" stamp until today, so this beer is definitely past it's prime (and once again, way to go re: freshness, Total Wine).

Poured into a Jever Pilsener glass, this was a chill-hazed, slightly amberish golden color, with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds. Despite the lack of head there's lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward. No lace at all.

Big, crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine, so 50% what I expected and 50% WTF.

Grainy malts with a side of diacetyl. Yum...

Light bodied, but not as light as it should be. Lousily low level of carbonation.

Pretty awful, in part due to age, no doubt, but I don't think there was much chance of anything commendable even if fresh. Oh, well, I'm a little closer to my dorky goal of having at least one beer from every brewing country on Earth."
Worst,Max,1.3,"A-Clear gold, thin head.

Smell- Gross. I can't put my finger on it, it just smells funky and gross.

Taste- Almost as bad as the smell, metallic and bitter with an awful after taste.

MF- Not that bad actually. Crisp.

Overall- I was expecting bad and was still disappointed. Worst beer I have had in Korea and that is saying a lot."
Worst,Max,2.43,"Pours a typical golden amber with thin head. Not much aroma. Initial taste is very sweet and almost maple like. Not a lot of body or flavor. Subsequent sips yield nothing. Almost has a corn candy kind of aroma and taste. Thin and not a lot of substance. I guess if you eat a lot of spicy Korean food, you would not even tell the difference or care how the beer tastes."
Worst,Max,2.08,"Pours a finger and half of head on a clear golden colored body.
The aroma is a faint candy lemon smell.
The taste is metallic with mild bitterness. Not great.
The texture is quite fizzy, too much with a crisp body.
Don't smell, taste or feel good. What else is there to say?"
Worst,Max,2.6,"Poured from 12oz can into a pint glass. The can says this is made from all-malt, so perhaps it should fall into the pale lager category, rather than adjunct lager?

Appearance: golden hue with a haze-free body and a strong effervescence. Head is a finger of quickly-subsiding white foam. Not bad, for the style.

Smell: sweet with a definite corn pops character thrown in the mix. The can says all-malt, but it does indeed smell quite adjunct-y. Not great, but relatively free of off-putting aromas.

Taste: like the aroma, it's quite sweet with a hint of corn, but really it's not too bad. Nothing I would go out of my way to get, but as the style goes, there's at least a little flavor here. One unfortunate area is hops, though -- they are not at all distinguishable. Points lost for that.

Mouthfeel: light body but a big carbonation with a good creaminess for the style.

Overall: quite drinkable, although it's not an inspirational beer by any means. Still, for an adjunct lager in a can, you can do a lot worse."
Worst,Snow Beer,1.78,"Picked up at the local supermarket just up the street from our hotel in Lhasa.

Poured from a can, this beer actually looks pretty decent in a glass. The beer pours a pale gold color with pretty decent head retention and considerable lacing. Alas, things went down hill quickly from there. On the nose, I'm picking up some light grain and a hint of light soap. It's not awful, but it's not particularly attractive either. The flavor profile is just more of the same, and I'm trying to remember the last time I had a beer this light, watery and bland. Mouthfeel is light and watery, with no finish to speak of. Alcohol is undetectable.

This beer is fully deserving of the ""awful"" score it has so far received on this site. Where's the nearest drain for this swill?"
Worst,Snow Beer,2,Cerveza dorada con un dedo de espuma que se esfuma rápidamente. Aroma herbáceo y un poco de malta. Cerveza sencilla pero no deja de ser una mala opción por su precio.
Worst,Snow Beer,3.56,"Yesterday was to have been the ocCANsion of my Happy New Russo-Japanese-Vietnamese-Chinese CANned Beer Sunday, CANrades (Week 754) (добро пожаловать обратно в С новым русским-日本人-Tiếng Việt-中文 Пиво воскресное, товарищи (неделя 754), but I only have one Vietnamese CAN & the Chinese beers bogged down because of needing either/both adds & pics. 8={} I am now back on track.

From the CAN: ""OG: 11.0P""; ""Brewed for Export"".

It was CANother wee 330-ml CAN so following the Crack! of the vent, I just let it free-flow Glug into the awaiting glass. I watched in rapt fascination as it foamed up to form just under two fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with modest retention. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was clean & moderately sweet. It was definitely adjunct-free, which is a real plus. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, just a step or two past watery. The taste was definitely malt-driven & quite sweet, but the lack of hops presence hurt it when reviewing to style. Still, it was nice to be drinking an adjunct-free Lager on a hot, humid Summer's evening. Finish remained sweet, at about the upper limit of my tolerance, but still within spec. Not a bad attempt at a Lager, IMHO. YMMV."
Worst,Snow Beer,2.5,De Lidl. En copa Alhambra. Jugando a Shantae's Half Genie Hero. Tampoco esta tan mala como la pintan. Tipica lager industrial ligerita de malta pero sin nada desagradable
Worst,Snow Beer,1.49,"Poured into a wine glass(!) resulting in a pale yellow body with little head and not much bubbles. Aroma was faint corn and a touch of hay. Not much in the way of flavor. Basically poorly carbonated water with a pinch of beer flavor.

Snow is China's best selling beer. It originated in Shenyang. So, it can be found anywhere in Shenyang. They were owned by ABInbev but they've been sold to a Chinese company HQ'd in Hong Kong.

The local Shenyang food is quite heavy so Snow goes well with it. It's easy to drink a few liters and not become intoxicated. I drank too much Snow during my week in Shenyang. Plus, it's really cheap. A six pack of cans is priced for about 1USD."
Worst,Snow Beer,1.57,"Drank this one from the bottle twice at local restaurants in Beijing. 500ml green bottle, served in small glasses with multiple pours. Clear light golden yellow body, one finger white head, short retention. Smell is mostly watery with a touch of barley and a bit of a perfume smell to it. Flavour follows, mostly water with barley grain sweetness, a bit of earthy weirdness to it. Thin mouthfeel, did I say this tasted watery before? Overall, a very poor beer that I suppose accomplishes the purpose if you want to drink something that isn't water but tastes like water, but it doesn't even taste very good at all."
Worst,Snow Beer,2.8,"This was my 5th beer while travelling in China on business in April 2015. This beer was rated at China's #1 consumed beer so it was a must try. My research before leaving the states indicated this was an Anheuser-Busch InBev product brewed by China Resources. This beer had an 4.7ABV according to my language assistant; this is different from the information indicated below (4.3) by BA and one reviewer indicated a 2.5ABV as shown on a can. I poured from a clear, 330ml bottle into a glass.

A - pale straw yellow with minimal carbonation although it produced a reasonable white head
S - light citrus with the slightest hint of grains
T - light, bland with no hint of grains; again, a rather bland beer
F - light, watery - nothing to speak of

As mentioned, the beers here are light, session style brews. If you have high expectations of finding something akin to the brews in the States, you will be wanting! Good for washing down the food."
Worst,Snow Beer,2.45,"So, I've been teaching English in northern China for the past few days, and found this beer in a local shop. 5 Yuan, about $1 CAD. It wasn't all that great, and most Chinese beer is not quite as strong as the stuff in Canada or the U.S., I think it's because they make it to go with their meals, which tend to be longer. This stuff is about %2.5 ABV and 9 degrees plato (says so on the 500ml can).

look: Perfectly fine, nice golden yellow with a head that fades quickly, for Chinese beer it seems to be the norm.

Smell - a bit of grains, light and grassy, not much to say here either.

Taste - bland, like your average light beer.

Feel - like most Chinese lagers, rather light, smooth and fizzy.

Overall - compared to some other beers in China, this stuff is actually a pass, though to be honest most standard Chinese beer would be a pass for anybody into craft, it tends to be very light and sessionable, at least based on a few days experience."

I remember getting drunk on this turd-foam when I was 17 back in the late 80's. The beer scene in Melbourne was a lot cruder back then, and the variety was pretty abysmal. But hey, we were none the wiser. I discovered Coopers Red back in 1990, and never looked back. Glad to say that now, and just like everywhere else, we have a wonderful variety of beers that I would have died for back then. But - back to Vomit Bombs. I had the misfortune of drinking a Vermin Belch the other day, and I couldn't even finish it.

There's almost as many analogies for Victoria Bitter, as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis. It's arguably Australia's most famous beer - piss off Fosters - and is certainly the most popular. There's hardly a pub where you can't find it either in tap or can/stubbie, and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem (is it girt by sea, or gird by sea?)

You either like VB, or you don't. There's no room for sitting on the fence with this beer. It's either something more sacred than holy water, or if your mum was on fire, you wouldn't even use it to try and extinguish her. I used to hate VB, I used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer. I used to hate people who drank it. I was a downright snob, and used to look down on people who drank it - especially religiously. But my palate is diversifying, and let's give it a go, to see if I still hate it, or whether it's something that is at the very least tolerable.

Look: This is going to be my 11th beer review, and all but 2 so far have been Aussie adjunct lagers. I will get to the better beers eventually. Poured into a pint glass, we've got a lovely honey gold liquid, clean, filtered. A thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top, but it didn't froth up. It's a little darker than your standard Aussie adjunct lagers, and it actually looks more appealing.

Smell: The classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the Pride of Ringwood hops, sweet pale malt, slightly sour. Am I overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like Orange peel? I remember thinking it used to smell offensive. I no longer do. it just smells classically Australian.

Taste: Malty sweetness, nice bitterness. Getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness. Smooth, easy drinking. Flavours are mellow, but prominent. Subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip. Slight adjunct taste but not overly powering.

Feel: Fairly highly carbonated, which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer. Ice Cold it is extremely refreshing. Body is medium,

Overall; Either I've lowered my expectations, or I've diversified my palate, and I'm no longer a snob. I can't hate this beer any more. I'm not saying I necessarily love it, but I have grown to appreciate it. It's a part of Australian culture, and it's not going anywhere soon. It's certainly more drinkable than I remember it, and whilst I probably won't go buying slabs of this stuff, I certainly won't hesitate to go for it if I'm at the pub and there's nothing else worth drinking.

Will say, the beer has to be drunk cold. Ice cold. You can't afford to let these warm up,. Once it's creeping up to room temperature, the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on. That's where I think most people go wrong with VB. It's simply not served cold enough. Most lagers should be ice cold, and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play. Once it starts warming up, grab another one, or just drink em quicker."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),2,"2004: (375 ml bottle, in Norway.) Sweetish orange-like aroma. The flavour is mostly bitterness - more than in Foster's and Castlemaine, but not really pleasant. Will not be a regular beer of mine this one."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.35,"Sure it's just another commercial lager, but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local RSL, hence the higher score. One thing it has going for it (for an average to sh*tty lager) is that its slightly heavier in taste, not a totally watered down commercial lager as many are. Would I recommend it, probably not, but if you're in Oz, have a few just to blend in:)"
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),4.65,"This is my favorite beer after Satanic Chimp from Monkey Paw. I understand why so many people hate it, I just like that. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find it in the US. Maybe it's nostalgia for drunk port visits back in my navy days.
(I'm trying to get my list together.)"
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.46,"I've had it numerous times in pint glasses, stubbies, straight out of the can, even off the ground on one drunken evening. It tastes average at best regardless of what you do with it. It's a middle-class beer that's supposed to be pounded on a hot summer evening after a hard day's work in the trenches, or from your couch.

The look is like any other dime-a-dozen lager, that classic piss-yellow tint. The smell has hints of alcohol and rice. The taste is well, I don't know; Like a Budweiser but with more tang. The feel is below average. Very carbonated and watery."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.28,"How is this beer like? Might be judged as poor overall but still does way better than the Euro Pale Lagers. Looks a bit darker in color than its American counterparts and has a faint smell (of apples?) but still okay. Its taste starts off as something clear, then takes a turn into strange malts or hops, who knows (again weird apples come into my mind) but still feels better than Coors Light. Then I read that it has added sugar, perhaps that's where this strange sweetness comes from! To sum it all up, it is not that bad overall (have been drinking Japanese adjuncts for weeks now celebrating the end of the year in 2017), even my wife seems to like it! It isn't a craft beer but it's not even supposed to be one. It is an okay American type lager, not great but nothing to complain about really."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),2.77,"Look - standard lemon yellow with high carbonation. no head.
Smell - biscuits and malts, not much else.
Taste - crisp but finishes with some sweetness that seems a bit out of place. not bad, but a bit peculiar.
Feel - light bodied, fairly watery, but easy to drink.
Overall - this is an adjunct lager inside out, but the sweetness gives it a distinct Aussie flavor that makes it different from other adjunct lagers. can't say i like it, but at least its unique in that way."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.54,"Lager gold, fadey puffy white. 3.75
Clean dusty grain. 3.5
Grain sack, slight tartness, touch of sweet extract, cola syrup end, then vague drying IBUs. 3.5
Light +, dry snappy. 3.75

Does best when it sticks to lager notes. But then weird syrupy bits poke through. Neurotic and artificial, nothing like an English bitter, but not terrible. Be interesting to line this up next to Shiner Bock, another hot weather “dark” beer. 3.5"
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),3.1,"From Saveur-Biere. In Teku glass. After dinner. Biterness reminds cruzcampo, but its more tasty and malty, with some wet herbal notes. Pretty drinkable."
Worst,Victoria Bitter (VB),1.23,"I spent 4 years of my life living in Australia, and was always surprised at why people liked this so much. This makes even Carlton draught seem nice..! At least Carlton Draught has some hoppiness!

However I was forced to drink this often, as a result of Aussies who regularly insisted on buying me a drink because of my ""accent"" and how drunk they always were! Haha...

This has a dryness and heaviness that makes it difficult to drink fast, and an overall flavor that is not really a flavor. It tastes like it has been pasteurised at 9000 centigrade for a year.

Beer in Australia is really expensive, Carlton and United must be making more money than Vegemite..

Had another recently in Bar Oz in Paris. Even compared with Euro lagers like Heineken and Carlsberg, this is even worse. Probably the worst beer I have had, it is really quite amazing how many Aussie hillbillies love the stuff.

Yet it does bring back some good memories of watching crab racing in Sydney while backpacking..."
Worst,Red,1.87,"Yesterday I reviewd Gold Bitter - Tooheys Gold, and commented how the Toohey's Bitter series whose zenith came about in the 80s and early 90s, has seemingly died out. Red Bitter, is seemingly still around, and able to be purchased in 30 can blocks. However, my local has them in singles cans too. As mentioned in my Gold Bitter review, despite the fact these beers are rare as hens teeth, they must still being drunk by people in quantities worth brewing for. So it's good to see these old school classics around, even if they're not what they were in there hey dey.

It appears that they've reduced the ABV on these again to 4% - still classifying it as a full-strength beer. Let's see if it holds up to it's label as 'full flavour'. As with the Gold Bitter, the design of the can is still classic old-school, with the Tooheys Stag being replaced by the weathered looking man holding a schooner glass. Clearly this must be a drink for the hardy and tough. Let's find out!

Look: As with Every Australian lager, it's a classic golden straw colour. Poured into my Arundel Brewing Co. Pint, it's heavily carbonated, lots of bubbles racing to the top. Head is a light frothy 1 finger, but look like it'll stick around too long. As with all Australian lagers, filtered, and you can see right through the glass. Looking like any Australian lager.

Smell: It's got all the classics of an Australian lager. Although I would have to say this one smells particularly 'dusty'. That's right, dusty. Almost like you have gotten a whiff of the inside of your vacuum after you've hoovered the floor. There's Pride of Ringwood hop notes, again classic Australian lager smell, and that vegetable smell which is all too common with Aussie adjunct beers. It's not horrid, just not overly exciting.

Taste: Sweet character. Not overly bitter. Quite bland. Aftertaste gets that slight vegetable taste, almost like you've walked into a fruit & veg shop. Dry finish, that lingers with that vegetable taste. Some unpleasant notes that could be chemical residue. It's not great. Reminds me of that stale cigarette mouthfeel, and hour after you've had one.

Feel: Highly carbonated, so it's drinkable if you go quickly. Fairly thin. Not a great deal of body to it.

Overall: 30 years ago in its heyday, this might have been a once quaffable lager. However, despite the fact it's somewhat readily available in Sydney, it's market of drinkers have clearly moved on, or passed on. With it's reduction in ABV to 4% - I don't think it's as full flavoured as it once was, and the overall flavour leaves a bit to be desired. I do have a soft spot for these old-school beers, but I feel like this one may not be the beer it once was, and as such is . I want to like it, I really do - if anything for the old-school packaging, but unfortunately the aftertaste is the killer, and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
Worst,Red,2.9,Light amber gold under a smallish medium lasting head. Very faint stale hops and hint of something floral as it warms. Light body. Very faint and short lasting burst of watery bitter followed quickly by a weak floral hop and corn nectar sweet middle finish. Bland stale aftertaste.
Worst,Red,2.08,"Format: returning to this beer for the first time in years, as I have decided to try every beer I can find (whether I want to or not). A tacky macro 375mL can with that ""look how great my dodgy 70's label that I never bothered to update"" label.

Appearance: looks better than I remember - light yellow with chunky macro carbonation sprinting up the glass. A thin head with good retention.

Aroma: the main issue here is that there is virtually no aroma at all. The slightest cheap grain and off metal from the can / carbonation.

Taste: ah. It's all coming back to me now. Very light cheap grain, that off metallic fug and a really unfortunate chemical taste of some kind. That's the disaster I remember. Fortunately it is actually quite a soft flavour.

Aftertaste: what little there is drops away virtually instantly. You can tell what this was originally designed for - to be thrown back en masse without being too concerned with trifling aspects such as taste or quality.

Mouth feel: quite thin and a bit watery, with enough carbonation to make this somewhat refreshing in the same way that throwing back a can of water might be.

Overall: this is a very old-fashioned beer designed to quench the thirst of people that didn't really care what a beer tastes like. Or perhaps didn't want a beer to have taste, so they can drink it like water while working the farm on an incredibly hot Aussie summer day. Not sure, but it's pretty ordinary."
Worst,Red,2.28,"This beer sure does cop some flak...

It's a beer that's more than the sum of its parts:

There is basically no odor, nothing exciting to look at, it's cheap, it's low ABV.... however...

On a hot day, this goes down a treat - it's easy to drink, the flavour is weak and the mouthfeel is watery - just what's needed sometimes. A completely inoffensive beer.

The flavour profile is a slightly sweet grain up front and a mild hop bitterness on the finish - all in all, a well balanced brew. Very little aftertaste.

As I crack another can on this warm Melbourne I feel pleased, pleased to enjoy something that is a very honest, no bullshit, macro lager - but it is, by all means, a macro lager.

Walk in to your local bottle shop and pick up a cube of this for next to nothing - it's great on a stinking hot day when you need something refreshing, light and don't need to think about too much. Goes well with cheap snags in white bread and mowing the lawn."
Worst,Red,1.08,"Back in my youthful days, I was often eager to grab a 30 can block of this with my mates before heading to a party for a long evening of sessional drinking. It was cheap ($31 AUD for 30 cans) and served its purpose as a cheap alcohol delivery system. Reminiscing over my childhood days, I decided to try a can of this to experience a blast from the past and bring back those blissful memories of drinking as a teenager. However, I didn't expect to disgrace my tastebuds and wretch my stomach in the process.

A: An aggressive pour leaves the beer with a head of approximately one finger, which doesn't want to stick around for very long - after 20 seconds it's gone, and you wouldn't even know it existed, as lacing seems to be nonexistent in this brew. the actual beer itself looks almost completely translucent when held up to the light, giving it a typical appearance of several Aussie macro lagers.

S: Smell? You'd think it'd have one. I literally had to sniff until my nostrils caved in to get even the tiniest whiff of aroma from this beer, which eventually turns out to contain an offensive smell of stale hops and metallic odours - possibly a byproduct of the can sitting on the bottle shop's shelf for a few dozen light years.

T: Dearest Mary Mother of God, this tastes atrocious. A fierce taste of long-stale hops grinds the tastebuds and is further insulted by a watery aftertaste. A peculiar thing about this beer is that the hops and the barley can be tasted almost seperately. It is as if the brewery hastily tossed all of the ingredients together and quickly sealed it in a can. A complete lack of anything that could resemble a body leaves an inconsistent taste which, coupled with the painful bitterness of stale hops, gives this beer a truly appalling taste.

M: Nothing much to say here - the watery aftertaste leaves the mouth pondering over whether it just had beer or soda water in it.

O: After tasting this macro again, I look back on my younger days in disgust and scorn. There's a very good reason why cases of this gather dust in bottle shop shelves and are sold at ridiculously low prices, and that is because nobody has the temerity or the low standards to dare drink it. Avoid this beer at all costs!"
Worst,Red,1.18,"This is

The Worst Beer I Ever Had.

Many years ago, as in BC - Before Craft, I had two weeks in England, sampling the finer ales on offer, and enjoying.

I returned to Aus, and had some of these left in the fridge, part of a case I had, bought as I had no money at the time and this was always the cheapest beer on the shelf. I had one and vowed never to drink it again.

Until one of my son's friends had one. I tried a little. The industrial cleaning chemicals added after the brewing have not changed over the years.

Once again....

I vow never to drink again."
Worst,Red,1.35,"Beer from a can - how bogan of me.

Pours a standard, slightly pale golden with nice dense white head, medium thickness, disperses a bit leaving a thin cushion. Fed by steady carbonation coming from about six isolated sources at the base of the stenge. Not bad, seems an appropriate appearance.

Smell? Apparently there is one. Well, there should be, it's beer. Hmmmm...

A lot of effort and I daresay some imagination gets me a pilsener-esque malt kind of smell and maybe some hint of Pride of Ringworm. But this is the imagination of some weird offspring of Lewis Carroll and Hayao Miyazaki talking. There is absolutely nothing there, really. Just a void where aroma should be.

Very uneventful, short and simple palate. If my life were as interesting as this I'd look forward to the exciting pain and torture of hell. Starts off bland, finishes bready and bland. Seriously, I would love to give an in-depth analysis of the malt profile, the intricacies of the bitterness and the beer's complex vicissitudes, but it would be comparable to going deep sea diving in a bathtub. With no water in it.

There is the slightest, slightest whisper of some caramel malt on the front and mid palate (and that is ALL there is), and then once it reaches the back of my mouth for swallowing it gives me that bread yeast character from a blend, maybe of POW and some cheap adjunct. But even the nastiness of this beer is weak and practically unnoticeable. That's not to say it's not nasty, it's just too piss-weak to make me retch.

Mouthfeel is as thin as a single cotton fibre, has absolutely no body. I guess all I can say about this is that it's drinkable, because even air has more toxins and more body than this. ""Full Flavour"" the logo says. My ass."
Worst,Red,2.16,"It looks ok. Golden in colour with a centimetre or two of head which drops away to ok retention. Some lacing.

Strong grainy aromas but not a lot else.

Is there any flavours involved because I couldn't detect any. Bit of grain?

Mouthfeel is ok in that it is not unpleasant but...

As a cheap alcohol delivery device I understand it but it ain't a beer."
Worst,Red,3.9,A great session brew. It's got a nice mouthfeel and has a really balanced flavour. I was a little turned off at first by the Bitter label but it wasn't too bitter att all. Definitely drinkable. I had this beer on tap in several pubs in NSW as well as Queensland. Those Aussies know how to do a macro right. Sure beats the heck out of our Macros here in the states. Cheers!
Worst,Red,1.88,"Clear mid gold colour lacks any redness they may be expected.
The bead hangs around unlike the head.
It has the vaguest smell of insipid beer.
There is a distinct maltiness at first and you think , will there be more? Alas there is not It turns into blandness.
In the mouth the blandness comes to the fore It is neither good or bad , just indifferent.
Hard to think this would be a choice if other options are available, but I think it might be more drinkable than VB"
Worst,Red,1,"I can't tell you anything you don't already know. This beer is god-awful. The fact that they sell it so dirt-cheap and nobody buys it speaks for itself. The taste is of flat chemicals. If my beer fridge was right next to my couch, and all I had to do was reach over and grab one...I wouldn't bother, even on a hot summer's day. Catching one of your mates buying a case of this would be almost on par with catching him walking out of a gay bar. In fairness to anyone from NSW, I must say that Carlton Diamond remains the worst beer I've ever had, but this is close! Take it easy boys and girls."
Worst,Red,1.3,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on this, this 'beer' is awful. No head, chemical smell, chemical taste, and I actually got some weird floating flakes of stuff in it when I poured it, tho I can't be sure it was the beer. Was trying a new glass, which I washed thoroughly beforehand. They actually reminded me of the hot break flakes you get when you're boiling wort, but I've never actually seen it in a finished beer. *shrug* This was pretty disappointing being that my favorite commercial beer is Toohey's Old."
Worst,Red,1.1,"im only giving this more than a one because it does remind me of my younger days when this first came out in a 30 can block and i used to go thru plenty when my freeloading associates used to come over and clean me out. in that sense it got me out of spending a shitload on good beers that would have been wasted. casting pearls before swine they called it in the bible.

you wouldnt think tooheys could brew a worse full strength beer than their new, but by golly they have. its even more putrid than CUB's worst, which is possibly the biggest insult a brewery could be on the recieving end of. if it wasnt for carlton cold there'd be no doubt. theres nothing to commend this beer, not color, head. smell, flavor, drinkability. nothing. ive seen more appealing substances go down the toilet. in fact i reckon if you pissed into a glass after a good belgian ale it would taste better than this. and you wouldnt have to pay any extra to get that.

as i say it brings back the memories. some good, but when it comes to the beer itself, im ashamed to admit ive ever drank it, especially more than one!"
Worst,Red,1.03,"The other reviewers are 100% correct when they say this chemically induced crap isn't even worth the bother. It's pretty much the same as all the other Tooheys (i.e. Red, Blue, Gold, New).
Don't touch this stuff even if your stuck in the outback and have nothing to drink, your on your last breath. Remember Dying is an option rather than drinking Tooheys Red."
Worst,Red,1,"Appartently there was a time when this was at least OK, i musn't have been around then, coz i have never ever had a good bottle, tastes like chemicals."
Worst,Cass Fresh,3.29,"Out of a bottle at The Prince in Korea Town, Los A feels, CA.

Well, straight up, it’s pretty flat as if Van Gogh was on Zoloft. Like, there’s not a lot going on here. As if Vincent was just dull, blank faced and sad (even more so, I suppose). No wild spirit in this one. No “hurray!” Ok, I’m out."
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.84,"Hey, come on, it is definitely NOT awful. Yeah, I know, it’s the same adjunct cr@p and yeah, It’s watered down and the aftertaste is quite bad and metallic.
But it feels better than most Japanese beers that they have here in Japan. Korean lagers are always better somehow.
Abd not to mention that it goes very well with Korean food! You can’t even feel its aftertaste… :)"
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.11,"330 ml bottle, from Green Peas, Stavanger. ABV is 4.5%. Clear pale golden colour, moderate white head. Sweetish aroma of pilsener malts, starch, grass and candy. Fizzy mouthfeel. Medium sweet flavour with the same elements as the aroma, very moderate hops."
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.27,"The secret to drinking Cass:

Step 1. Buy it in the large plastic bottle variety...multiple bottles

Step 2. Buy bottles of Soju.....multiple bottles

Step 3. In a safe location; IE; barracks room, day room, place of residence, etc.... pour beer into a solo cup, pour a shot or two of Soju in solo cup

Step 4. Drink and enjoy...responsibly....or something"
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.09,"Let's be real here. This beer becomes pretty good in your memory after a night in Hongdae mixing it with Soju and having to call the bars to see if they had any lost phones turned in the next morning. I remember the good times with friends from Cass, but I guess my mind purposely blocks out the taste. At the end of the day, it's a potable liquid that contains alcohol."
Worst,Cass Fresh,1.31,"L: color seems fine, but the beer head which comes up after pouring in the glass looks so rough.
S: Smell of hop&grain litely comes first, like ordinary american lager. But smell that comes later is awful.
T: Taste at the front is quite fine as an american larger. Little bit sweet and tast of corn comes first. But with the smell after swallowing, only bad taste remains in the mouth.
F: Very fresh because it is highly carbonated. But the smell & taste ruins everything
Overall : I recommend to mix it with Soju. It highly reduces awful taste at the behind."
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.62,"From a bottle at a restaurant in Seoul. Clear golden color with white head. Grassy smell. Light body. Tastes of cracker malts with some grassy hops. Typical Asian lager, goes well with food but not that interesting on its own."
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.33,"Got a bottle at Samhae Jib in Seoul.
Went well with the fatty food at the restaurant though, but when it's by itself, just a bland mass brew with little taste."
Worst,Cass Fresh,1.02,"Cerveza de cuerpo ligero y carbonatación baja. Del aroma se perciben granos y algún toque de pera. En boca es una cerveza olvidable, con poco que destacar. Mas que una cerveza parece una gaseosa."
Worst,Cass Fresh,3,Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into pint glass. A thin white head falls quickly with virtually no lacing. Color is clear straw with mild streaming carbonation. Aroma of strong grassy hops and yeasty bread. Mouthfeel is thin and light. Flavor is mild -- cracker with some hint of grassy hops. Overall it is decent but just very underwhelming.
Worst,Cass Fresh,2.93,"There really is nothing like drinking a ice cold lager on a hot day in an Asian country.

This is how I had this lager.
Nothing at all special, but it just tastes perfect in the right environment."
Worst,Cass Fresh,3.18,"Poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thin film with light lacing. Aroma of lightly grainy biscuit malt, grassy hops and a hint of lemon. Flavor is attenuated biscuit malt with a little husky grain, a hint of caramel, grassy hops. Flavor tuckers out into a bland, grainy and grassy finish. Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. If it looks, smells and tastes like a adjunct lager duck, then that what it is. I tend to rate this style higher than the average, mostly because, although I rarely crave one of these, their strength is being mild and inoffensive to the most people, and I find them to be drinkable if unmemorable. This is not one of the better adjunct lagers, and the flavor is simultaneously a little grainy rough and quite muted. This could be partially because, despite the unfortunate ""Fresh"" in the name, this has probably been sitting around for a long time, both in shipping and distribution. I know I've been watching for an opportunity to buy a single bottle for quite a few months (my favorite beer store got quarts of this; I wisely waited for a 12 oz. single). Bland and a bit a rough, a satisfactory, but forgettable adjunct lager, as so many commercial beers are from Asia. A boring, but painless tick of this brewery."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,3.33,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours translucent orange with a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet grain with banana notes. Tastes of sweet grain with a little bit of banana, but not that bright. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, an above average beer."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,3,"Ultimately there isn't much to make this stand out. It doesn't go beyond slightly bland from start to finish, but it's not offensive, so I can't rate it harshly. Still, there are better true 3's. 2010/07/21

An interesting brew with a hint of spiciness. 2010/11/05"
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,3.69,"The appearance of this beer is hazy yellow. The aroma is spicy with only a little bit of floral hops. The taste is sweet and with some clove and Belgian yeast spiciness. Medium body and with fairly intense carbonation. Overall, an easy to drink Saison."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,2.96,"It's sort of an orange yellow colour, kind of like Chinese gold. Topped with a half finger of whitish head that fades fast. Moderate, large bubbled, soda like carbonation, clear and filtered.

Smells of, lol, wet dog. Cardboard, Belgian Phenols, caramel and apples. Very kids soda like.

The taste follows the nose completely, the wet dog coming in at the end. Slightly more balanced and smooth than I was expecting from the nose though.

Has a very light body and is very much like a soda in it's carbonation.

I got this one in Kunming, China, and I'm drinking it in Chang Mai Thailand this longest day of the year, June 21, 2017. What can I say? Very light, very soda like, this brew is well named."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,2.2,"When I think of a farmhouse ale, I imagine something with a nice yeasty character and some spice on the nose and palate. It should have a medium mouthfeel, nice head retention, and a pleasant aftertaste with some lingering spiciness. It should not have an overpowering malt presence that detracts from the other characteristics. This one does not measure up by any of these criteria. I'm thinking this is not bottle conditioned, as the flavors, aromas, and carbonation seem quite underdeveloped. It's more like a simulation of a farmhouse ale than an actual one."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,3.4,"Poured from a 16 ounce can, it was light straw in color, some haze, with no head unless poured down the middle of the glass. Even then, it dissipated rapidly leaving nothing.

A hint of fruit in the nose invites a sip but some corn in the background.

Tasting some slight sweetness , very little farmhouse and a refreshing, almost citrus note that is palate cleansing.

Thoroughly enjoyed this beer on a warm spring afternoon."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,1.64,"Pours hazy yellow with a white head, which has poor retention and leaves no lacing. The aroma corn, grain, and some sweetness. Not pleasant.

If anything, it tastes worse than it smells. This is supposed to be a farmhouse ale? There is corn, grain, some sweetness, and some lemon tartness. Doesn't taste like a farmhouse ale at all.

Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Nothing to get excited about, and not worth trying again."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,3.38,Slightly sweet with some citrus notes and a bit of a wheat taste to it i kinda expected to be a bit cloudy. Definitly not bad for the price. This is one of the better ones to come out of the minhas brewery.
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,2.77,"Pours a rustic orange with h a one finger white head that the sissapates quickly. Has a very sweet, Rainey smell. A very sweet malt taste. There is not much money re a Han sweetness happening here. Is an easy drinker. Less than average but not awful. I could drink a few if I had to."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,4,"Bunch of haters! I visited their brewery and sampled a wide variety of their many craft beers. I left with a case of ""Lazy Mutt"" which is very drinkable. It does finish ""a little ""chamganey"" but I like that."
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,2.98,"Bottled and possibly bottle conditioned
Pours a slightly hazy cloudy golden body with big foaming white head that retreats but pretty much sticks around"
Worst,Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale,2.04,"Second to last one from the tour variety pack...
Poured into shaker pint; golden straw color with a half-finger clear white head that fades in seconds to a fizzy film of bubbles fed by small, lively carbonation.
Smell is almost the same as all their other ones; smells like light corn and sugar, but it does have a vinous, champagne-like scent.
Taste is all corn and sugar, nothing else. Same sickly-sweet Minhas finish, the vinous quality of the smell isn't present at all in the taste. This is NOT a saison.
Mouthfeel is thin; the carbonation approaches saison but doesn't reach the proper level.
Overall, it's sugary corn-water, that's all this is. If you like generic cheap beer, you could probably stomach this, but if you're looking for a saison, stay away from this one."
Worst,Sol,1.47,Looks clear and light golden. Almost no smell at all. Slight slight skunky cornbread smell in there. Very light taste of carbonated water and hints of beer. This is not for me.
Worst,Sol,3,The look is light golden hay. Smells sweet and mildly hoppy Taste is solid only beaten IMO by Dos Equis for Mexican beer. Overall a solid Mexican beer. However based on price would not be a go to.
Worst,Sol,2.84,"Poured from a 32oz caguama bottle best by January 2023

On the pour, fizzy looking bubbles come together to make a one finger head that quickly dissipates to a surprisingly fine covering over the top of the beer. The body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and some very light lacing.

Smell is very light and almost not there, bit what I can pick up is just corny malts and some skunked hops from the clear bottle. At least it's clean apart from being light struck.

Taste is a bit of a let down. Once again very light. Right on the very first sip there is a hit of bitterness that implies hops but that quickly fades as you drink and get used to it. There is a certain minerality and tartness as well that lingers until the malts fully take over about halfway into the sip. The hops don't taste fresh at all and are only providing bitterness and grass flavors. One again very clean with almost no yeast notes.

Feel is actually decent being very drinkable and has some actual body to it although it is still very light once you get past the carbonation and head stage of the sip. The finish isn't as short as I would've expected for a beer this light amd it leaves you feeling malty and a bit boozy for a decent while after your sip.

Overall it's alright. You can do better from Mexico, but it's about on par with all the other clear bottles that come from down there. Victoria and Tecate are both better and Tecate is the same style too."
Worst,Sol,3,"Drunk during my trip to Silao (Guanajuato, México). Usual bottle of the brand.

L: clear pale yellow an some gold. On top, a thin head of white foam about 2 cm. tall; good collar and lacing

S: peaches, bread, some corn

T: more grain than bread malt. It has a lingering peach aftertaste that is good; no major hop in the brew.

F: light with a small amount of big-bubbled carbonation. After a while, it comes off as heavier than a lightweight.

O: a light brew. I like it. Usual Mexican beer."
Worst,Sol,3.95,"12 oz. bottle poured into tight nonic
(best by date printed on neck: March 20, 2022)

L: clear pale yellow with lightest hint of gold; topped by thin head of white foam about 1/3-inch tall; keeps nice collar and almost a full skin; light sticking and lacing

S: peaches, bready peach malt, dusty stale corn

T: more grain than bread malt but the same notes from the nose are here in the flavor; it has a lingering peach kolache aftertaste that's nice; no major hop presence but there is a light earthy/black pepper note that flashes

F: light and fluffy with a small amount of big-bubbled carbonation ... it's almost flat by macro-brew standards but it's not flat, plenty of prickle in the development toward the finish; over time it comes off as heavier than a lightweight, maybe a light-middleweight

O: nice adjunct lager with more malt presence than most American versions; super easy to drink and in big mouthfuls; if the ABV were 3.5 instead of 4.5%, it might be perfect"
Worst,Sol,3.58,"I bought a can at the beer store in Ontario 473ml at 4.5%. clear golden color with good carbonation.
Poured a 1finger head glass that disappeared but leaving as lace as you drink it .
My can is not from Mexico it was brewed by Molson Coors In Canada.
So maybe there will be a difference from the original beer.
The beer taste very light not much bitterness and just a plain malty hint of lemon taste .
Very easy to drink thought it was gonna be crappy beer but it's actually ok and an average beer to drink .
Maybe Molson Coors did the better job brewing this beer then the original from Mexico.
Canada has better water I think .
Cheers"
Worst,Sol,1.97,"Sol Cerveza is one of those Corona knockoffs that seem to be popping up left and right in an attempt to gain a foothold in the light easy drinking, adjunct lager category. You know going in this isn't a beer that's for connoisseurs, and is only there to fulfill a market of people who either don't drink beer or people just wanting to knock back a seemingless endless supply of liquid in the hope it gets them drunk and not bloated. This 650ml long neck of Mexican beer, is apparently imported from the Netherlands into Australia, for Pinnacle Drinks which is basically Woolworths alcohol importer. Isn't globalisation great?!

Look: Poured into a pint glass. Extremely carbonated. Hundreds if not thousands of bubbles surround the interior of the glass, and plenty racing their way to the surface in search of freedom or a better life than my stomach. Bubbly white head that disappears before you know it. Head look promising, but non existent after 30 seconds, giving an appearance of golden soda water. Straw gold, completely filtered can see right through the glass. Standard adjunct lager look to it, nothing to write home about. The head dissipating in seconds, is disappointing.

Smell: Classic Mexican/Central American adjunct beer smell. Corn, light citrus notes, stale white bread, but not a great deal going on.

Taste: Taste follows the nose. Very thin body. Very sweet, very smooth almost no bitterness to speak of. Maybe some light hop extract, but nothing to exactly write home about. Pretty bland, there's a weird chemical roundness to the overall flavour.

Feel: Highly carbonated, thin body , slight dry finish. Highly drinkable if you're just wanting to knock these back without tasting anything.

Overall: I'm not knocking it because I don't think it's good. i'm knocking it, because unless I'm lying on a tropical beach somewhere for it to quench a thirst, it's not doing anything for me. Outside of a hot environment where you're relaxing and just drinking for a buzz, it's not worth the effort and the carbs. It's a summer beach beer that'll help get the taste of salt water or chlorine (if you're in a pool) out of your mouth. Nothing more, nothing less."
Worst,Sol,2.91,"11.2 oz. bottle poured into pint glass
Look: 1 finger head dissolves into thin layer, light straw color, some lacing
Smell: Mild aroma, cereal grains
Taste: Mild taste, some sweetness with a little cereal in background. A bit watered down on the finish.
Feel: Excellent carbonation, medium body.
Overall: General impression, if I want something simple and not too heavy fund something else.
Pair with spicy food, grilled steak or burgers or fried food."
Worst,Sol,1.75,"2002: There are so much better beers under the sun................................ For some reason this beer is still available in Norway, competing with Corona, but selling less. Thin mouthfeel and flavour of maize / corn. A lime wedge does not help much. Still drinkable when ice cold."
Worst,Sol,1.49,"Cerveza pálida de carbonatación media y cuerpo ligero. Aromas débiles herbáceos y algo de cereal. En boca es plana, mejor que la Corona (no es difícil) e inferior a la Modelo."
Worst,Sol,2.01,"So we only had this with a lime so that may alter the rating. Its clearly the step child to Corona. Not nearly as good, but with a lime it will pass. It’s pretty inconsequential. Not something I would seek out, not by a long shot, but once a summer it can be consumed with little issue."
Worst,Lone Star Light,2.75,"A very nice lady gave this beer to me as part of a July 4 celebration, so I am in a good mood as I write this. The beer is what it is. You have to give it light and refreshing, and it tastes pretty good for a light lager. I have had worse. Happy 4th!"
Worst,Lone Star Light,2.91,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades superfast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is super light with just a little bit of caramel and malt. Along with these smells comes a touch of paper and herb.
Taste – The taste begins with a light cracker taste matched by a little bit of caramel sweetness. As the taste advances some paper and a touch of herb come to the tongue all while the sweetness increases just a bit to leave one with a still dry, but light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average. The carbonation should be higher for the style to make it more refreshing.
Overall - It is what it is. I would choose an alternative light lager over this if looking for an easy session."
Worst,Lone Star Light,1.77,"Lone Star Light is just as musty and grainy as the OG Lone Star, with little of the character that makes it so distinctive. It’s just not something I’d drink again if I had a choice. And I do!"
Worst,Lone Star Light,2.2,"Out of can in austin Texas. Not as bad as I thought it'd be. Tastes like it's hydrating? Definitely cheap grains, maybe corn? Kinda thicker texture, a tiny bit metallic."
Worst,Lone Star Light,3.86,"12 oz. bottle poured into tulip
(Feb. 12, 2018 best-by printed on bottle neck)

L: clear yellow, SRM 2-3 tops and so clear it looks like air in the glass, yellow-tinged air; pushes up quickly-dissipating head of white foam that eats at itself like a gose head; bubbles everywhere, and they push up a constant fluffy collar and most of a skin; fun to watch; not stick or lace

S: stale grain, sour grain, yeast everywhere ... loads and loads of dusty yeast; as it warms, hints of cracker malt show up, subtle and lightly sweet

T: grain, stale grain, big corn note midswallow through the finish and it's not creamed corn but real live corn; lots of yeast; over time it gets some of that American adjunct lager housepaint note many of them have ... hard to describe ... might the yeast mixing with other notes

F: that lightweight/heavy carbonation combination us soda drinkers grew to love; it's over carbed of course, but I still like it a lot ... helps cleanse the palate

O: the grain flavor is much, much more prominent than I expected, and while the nose isn't worthy of worldwide acclaim, every now and again you can pick up a pinch of barley malt sweetness; for the genre and at 3.85% ABV, it's fantastic. I don't expect much from an American light lager, and this one easily surpasses those expectations."
Worst,Lone Star Light,1.6,These are cheap and easy to drink. Mostly because it's water and can hydrate you better than Gatorade on a hot summer day. I believe you can only purchase the light version of this beer in Texas.
Worst,Lone Star Light,1.5,"Pretty much the same as the regular version, only taste is lighter and seemed watered down; cereal grains but not much else. Light bodied. Not much too it."
Worst,Carling Beer,2.02,Cerveza popular en Inglaterra. Tiene una gran cabeza blanca. Es de cuerpo ligero y con alta carbonatación. Aroma y sabor cítrico. Para tomar con pocas pretensiones.
Worst,Carling Beer,2.93,"had this in a few different pubs in England

it's nothing special and it isn't even really good but imo it's still better than bud light

im an IPA man myself but I wanted to try something different. was still better than a few of the AAL/EPL i had in europe"
Worst,Carling Beer,2.79,"From a can, pours a bright gold colour with a good thick white head that disapates but laces well. Aroma grass, grain, bread, corn. Taste malt, corn, malt, sweet crisp and clean."
Worst,Carling Beer,3.25,"From Hipecor. 50cl can. In Ikea's pint glass. Reading CSHTP6 Ch7. Much more balanced than other adjunt lagers, with the corn little noticeable. Very drinkable and smooth. Good body for its low ABV."

Worst,Carling Beer,2.55,"Added again after vanishing from Beer advocate...

Bright golden color with a thick head that would not go away (even 30 minutes later) and leaving laces, to make any true Pilsner envy.
Very light aroma of bready malt and very distant floral hops.
Sweet flavor of pale malt and corn with floral and herbal hops. A little cardboard on the finish.
Light body with good carbonation.
An adjunct lager a bit over average."
Worst,Carling Beer,2.78,"473 ml can served cold into a pint glass.

Appearance - Clear, pale golden yellow color. 2 fingers of white head with some retention. Sparse lacing. Lots of bubbles rise to the top of the beer. Looks decent.

Smell - Some adjuncts and light grassy and grainy aromas. Nothing offp putting and nothing powerful here either.

Taste - Fairly bland with some corn which makes the beer a bit on the sugary sweet side. Retains a clean and refreshing taste too.

Mouthfeel - Clean crisp and refreshing. Medium- high carbonation.

Overall . Not a lot to say other than a better than expected AAL and definitely preferred to many of them."
Worst,Molson Dry,2,Not much taste. Not much of anything! If I was handed this blindfolded I wouldn’t think it was beer. Does not taste bad but does not taste like beer.
Worst,Molson Dry,3.24,"I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario 473ml at 5.5%.
poured a 2finger head into glass .
taste was refreshing and smooth with a crisp finish.
overall an average lager beer.
cheers"
Worst,Molson Dry,3.07,"750ml can purchased from Ontario grocer. Poured into a large glass mug (the entire 750ml fit in the mug). Lively and foamy head that lingered for a few minutes and dissipated to a 1/8"" film throughout the drink. A surprising amount of lacing. Carbonation was heavy off the start but tapered off and was rather subdued by mid-drink. Smells of corn with a very slight skunk - that familiar Molson aroma that is ever present in every college dive bar I've frequented in Ontario. The taste was surprising: very little of the ""adjunct skunk"" that I know and expect from Molson product. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised with a nuanced flavor with light grain notes, temperate hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and a dry finish - no off-putting aftertaste, either. I purchased this can with the intention of slamming it in a review; I was expecting a boozy version of Canadian. That didn't happen. I honestly enjoyed it. It's simple, refreshing and was attractive from pour to finish. I wouldn't turn this down in the future. At 5.5% and 750ml, this could certainly do some damage if several were downed on a hot summer day."
Worst,Molson Dry,3.21,"It pours a nice light yellow color with a nice head.
I started drinking this when we would travel to Expos games in Montreal. We would bring back a 12 pack each time we came home. It was a good tasting beer not the Best Molson but good tasting. the beer has a hoppy and dry finish which shouldn't be a surprise since its in the name."
Worst,Molson Dry,2.27,"Pours a clear yellow with decent head. That is the highlight of this one. The scent is faintly grassy, with a hint of lemon. The combination does not hit my nose well. Taste follows the smell, with some obvious bitterness evident. Thin mouthfeel and a slightly unpleasant bitter aftertaste"
Worst,Molson Dry,2.76,"473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. LCBO purchase for $2.50 CDN or so. Continuing my recent mini-run on Molson products.

Appearance - Fairly bright golden color, nearly two fingers of white head poured as well that fizzle out in a minute or two. No lacing, great clarity.

Smell - No smell other than some creamed corn and the slightest hint of apple skin.

Taste - Virtally nothing, watery, maybe some faint trace sweetness.

Mouthfeel - It is indeed dry, carbonation is a bit too much but is okay with the lack of flavor.

Overall - For a beer that tastes like nothing, yet has 5.5% ABV and is dry as indicated on the label, Molson hit the target the set here, unfortunately it's not a brew worth repeating. Still could've been so much worse."
Worst,Molson Dry,3.21,"473ml can that was purchased across the boarder in Dunham.

Crystal clear pale yellow golden hued brew, slight sweet smell of corn and a mild cracker graininess. Clean for the most part, bone dry with a kiss of alcohol. Very clean grain flavor, modest hop bitterness ... not a whole lot of flavor but a bit drinkable or perhaps just refreshing."
Worst,Molson Dry,2.46,"L- straw yellow, fairly clear, low-medium lace, foam dies down quick.

S- smells like any cheap lager. Still better than most american beers.

T- tastes clean, bready, corn. I really don't get much Hopps but they must be in there. Best served ice cold from a cooler of ice to down quickly for a warm buzz.

F- goes down clean tasting like great Western light lager in the yellow tint can, without that watered down taste of American lagers though.

Overall a 710ml can for $4.50 CAD hits the spot if you want to have just over one with the boys. it's best drank ice cold like most cheep brews."
Worst,Molson Dry,2.33,"Appearance - Poured from a 16 oz can into a basic 16 oz bar glass, pours a very clear straw yellow. 3 fingers of foamy head formed although I think that may have just been because I straight poured. The head dissipates fast leaving behind a thin film.

Aroma - Corn, cereal grains, Very faint hops and the classic metallic smell that haunts Lots of molson beers!

Taste - Sweet corn up front and that classic spring water lager taste, followed by some bready grains and very faint floral hops. The hops stick around though you get that classic molson metallic taste... It then finishes quite dry, guess the name makes sense.

Feel - Light watery body, light tingly carbonation, dry slightly bitter finish.

Overall - Just your average AAL, Nothing special, It states on the back of the can that it has no offputting flavors and I guess I cant argue that... I think the reason for that is because theres just not much flavor. This is pass in my books."
Worst,Molson Dry,2.25,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing

Worst,Genny Light,3.88,Genesee Light is a good beer. One of the best light beers I've ever had. It's made in NY which is a major plus. The flavor is nice and has a hint of citrus. Carbonation is appropriately measured and it's not expensive. Definitely worth a try.
Worst,Genny Light,4.12,"I’m giving this beer a 5 in appearance. There literally was a carbonation “tornado” that formed after I poured into a glass. Never in thousands of beers have I seen this. Smell is awful, taste is very smooth and easy to slug down. Enjoyable for what it is."
Worst,Genny Light,2.88,"24oz can stamped H158 1103:38 poured into a large mug at fridge temp, no ABV listed on can. The beer pours bright light golden straw yellow with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring skim coating. The aroma is a little yeasty and vegetable. The taste is very nuetral up front with no real malt washing into a barely tart, mildly bitter and buttery finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and an undry finish. Overall, average. Too much unfinished business for this yeast. The microwave popcorn butter is the strongest flavor here."
Worst,Genny Light,3.67,"We utilized this at a middle of nowhere, upstate New York casino. Found it at a “redemption center” in a one stoplight town. The 12er was located on the bottom of the cooler fridge in a section that hadn't been opened since the 90’s. Went down easy and did the job."
Worst,Genny Light,2.84,"Poured from the can into a standard pint glass.

A: clear light yellow, medium sized, white bubbly head that dies down into a compact disk, leaving very little lacing.

S: Neutral smell, light corn, light cereal.

T: It's pretty much average light AAL fare, corn and little bittering. Infintely crushable like an LAAL should be. Not a ton in the way between this and water.

M: Slick, light-medium bodied, standard LAAL mouthfeel that's very refreshing on a very hot day.

O: Typical LAAL. I'd recommend the light version over regular for sure, especially if you're just looking to drink outside at a BBQ. At $14/24pk. or less most places, it's kinda hard to go wrong with this one if you're going to be outside packing'em away."

Worst,Genny Light,2.5,"New to the beer aisles here in Utah, got a couple tall boys due to their great price
Look is light gold with a tiny tiny amount of foam
Smell is light with a little vinegar, a little straw, and a little bread
Taste is... Spoiled, I'm assuming I got a bad batch, way too vinegary, I'll give this a neutral 2.5 all around until I can find fresh ones. No freshness date smdh"
Worst,Genny Light,2.41,"I drank this brew in college in upstate NY years ago and had no idea they even made a light beer. Pours mellow yellow with full clarity and no head. Nose is light bread malts. This is incredibly thin and has relatively low carbonation, vague corny malt flavor and almost no complexity at all. What you see is what you get. At 3.8% you could concievably put away quite a few if that was your hankering. This 24 oz tall boy can will barely give you a buzz."
Worst,Genny Light,3,"Not as flavorful as regular Genny, but good for rapid consumption on a hot day. I would buy this before any of the other light beers just because it is brewed by a lesser-known, but solid, brewery."
Worst,Genny Light,2.03,"From the back of Jim's fridge.
Drank straight out of the can but the small bit I poured into a glass was the palest of yellows with a bubbly white head. Wow that is earthy metallic grainy and watery. I shall never drink this beer again."
Worst,Genny Light,2.84,"Clearly labelled ""Genesee Light"" on my box and can label (not ""Genny Light"") - though I'm assuming it's the same beer. It also appears as Genesee Light on Genesee's website.

Introduced 1978. No ABV appears anywhere on the packaging. ""12 fl oz average calories: 100. Carbohydrates: 4.0g. Protein: 1.0g. Fat: 0.0g.""

Can is blue and white, with a simple label design. Standard pull-tab 12 fl oz format. No date codes anywhere unless the nebulous code on the bottom means something (I can't be bothered to google). Cost was $0.66 per 12 fl oz can at a beer distributor in NYC.

HEAD: Fills 80% of the glass, suggesting potential overcarbonation. White in colour. Boasts impressive frothiness and creaminess for a light lager; I'm impressed. Head retention is superb - ~10+ minutes, but that's to be expected in a 4.00% ABV brew. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. Terrific.

BODY: Not so terrific. It's a weak looking pale copper, suggesting a watery brew. Clear and clean, though, with obvious filtration and no off-putting sediment or lees.

Looks typical of the style, with a lackluster body and an impressive head. I suppose it's above average for the style overall.

AROMA: Corn adjunct, pilsner malts. I hoped for more graininess, but hey, at least it isn't metallic or anything. The corn adjunct doesn't seem cloyingly sweet, but this aroma definitely suggests a brew which is too sweet for its light body. I'm apprehensive going in...

Aromatic intensity is mild.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Okay. It's got a near perfect body for how light and neutral in taste it is; that's a welcome change from the syrupy or watery budget lagers out there. Has a nice softness. Smooth, wet, and almost a bit refreshing, finishing pleasantly creamy to pleasant effect. Only a little overcarbonated.

Flavour is neutral, hitting on faint shallow notes of creaminess, weak corn adjunct, and generic pilsner malt. Very basic, not even throwing out any grassy hop flavours. But it isn't too sweet by my estimation - just insipid and reticent. I'll take that over a budget light lager riddled with metallic off-flavour any day of the weak, but I'd be kidding myself to say it's a well-executed brew. Very innocuous and inoffensive, which is more than can be said about many adjunct lagers (light or otherwise). It's balanced inasmuch as a beer this simple can be; there's not much to balance or harmonize.

OVERALL: It's basically exactly what one expects when picking up a budget light lager - inoffensive, neutral, not unrefreshing fare that would pair well with food if only because it's so insipid and drinkable. This is the kind of beer pong brew one could crush a sixer of with ease - and hey, it's only 100 kcal per can, so have at it. At $0.66 per can (the equivalent of $2.20 per 40oz), it's tolerable, but I'd definitely be more inclined to buy Trader Joe's Simpler Times or discounted Ballantine XXX when in the mood for a cheap neutral brew. In any case, along with Genesee Beer and Genesee Cream Ale, it's surprisingly good for its price and I'd happily recommend it to others interested in some nonjudgmental casual drinking.

This beer satisfies what seems to be the brewers' aims: it's a low calorie pleasant easy drinking lager. I'll enjoy polishing off the cans I picked up and I find this preferable to many adjunct lagers out there (American and European alike). It would make a terrific Summer barbecue brew or a smashable session lager to pair with atomic buffalo wings, but it's not going to impress discerning drinkers - even if does accomplish its meagre goals.

Low C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE

NOTE: As it comes to temperature, some unfortunate off-flavours do poke out their heads - DMS (cooked vegetable off-flavour) chief amongst them. I'm forced to drop this down to a ""C / AVERAGE"" as a result, but be sure to serve as cold as possible and you'll be grand.

C (2.84) / AVERAGE"
Worst,Genny Light,2.26,"Doesn't really taste like much of anything other than a little sweetness. Decent enough and extremely easy to drink, definitely not nasty in any way."
Worst,Genny Light,1.76,"Light beer never tasted so real. No, really it's one of the only light American beers that could pass for the real thing. Still not great though. Tastes of corn, slightly metallic, watery."
Worst,Genny Light,2.78,"Very light yellow color, perhaps the lightest (in the color sense) that I've ever seen.

Aroma is slight which is to say very little.

Taste is present though, like Coors light without the bite. I notice the prickly carbonation more than a beery flavor.

Texture is just what the scent and taste implied.

Frankly coffee has a greater effect on me than this beer. As close as I've come to drinking beer that almost isn't beer."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.12,"This is the best cheap beer hands down for a few reasons.
Number one is the taste. When I was a heavy drinker I would buy Pitbulls, Earthquakes and Natty Daddys. If it was a particularly rough week I'd have to drink Camo. All those drinks have a terrible sour taste to them that makes you cringe after a swig. The only reason you want to get drunk is to hide the same your feeling. Hurricane actually tastes fine as long as it's really cold. It doesn't have that sour and sickly aftertaste at all (as long as it's cold.)
Number 2 is the strength. 8% is lower than a heavy IPA, but it's way better than a light beer. It gets you drunk. After a rough week 2 (or 3 if you don't have to wake up early the next day) of these will relax you quite a bit. The drunk is good too unlike some of the super cheap paint thinner cans you can buy.
That's really all you need to know. The 'look' and 'feel' of this beer aren't important. It's the price, the ABV and the drunkeness. Enjoy!"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.79,"Poured from an undated 25oz can into a pils glass.

On the pour I am honestly surprised by a 2 finger fine head. The body has lively carbonation as expected, is a dark straw to gold crystal clear, and is crystal clear. The head recedes to a decent covering and remains relatively fine, some lacing is left.

Aroma on the other hand is as expected for a ""high gravity lager"". Smells kind of like sweat fermented ""green apple"" off notes along with skunk which I guess implies some sort of hopping. An alcoholic note resides at the back along with a vague note of malt. Overall it just smells like yeast that was treated like an alcohol producing slave and worked way past its useful limits with low quality hops and a malt bill that's been watered down with adjuncts, likely rice or corn syrup.

Flavor is quite similar to the aroma with some harsh out of place esters and a hard to explain tartness, behind that a surprising amount of hop bitterness creeps in likely to cover up dirty fermentation notes. Alcohol is detectable and the only positive to that is that eventually the burning and inebriation covers more and more off notes making what malt is present on the finish more and more noticeable as you drink, which is about the only redeeming factor once you actually start drinking.

Feel is at first light any other full flavor AAL but the co2 bit is quite high, and the finish is quite dry but surprisingly drawn out despite the general thinness on the palate. Not the worst but not the best pretty average, but it keeps it drinkable.

Overall it could be worse, but this isn't a very high quality beer. It will get you drunk, it's cheap, and it's not the worst thing that's passed my lips."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.63,"I find that instead of acquiring a taste for expensive craft beers, it's better to acquire a taste for cheap, high gravity beers. It's a lot cheaper and the money you save can be used for cheeseburgers. This beer fits the bill, it tastes better than Steel Reserve. While that isn't saying much, it's not bad and you get a lot of bang for the buck. I'm not going to pretend that I only drink for the taste. I like to get a buzz going, this one does it very effectively."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3,"From a 25oz can:

Appearance: Clear gold, big head.

Smell: Sweet, boozy.

Taste: Sweet, fruity—apples & grapes. Little bit of corn underneath. Boozy. No weird aftertaste.

Overall: Traveling for work, must pick up a beer or three. But the beer selection is not great in this smaller city, so let's try a malt liquor. Hurricane High Gravity is not bad! Sure, it's not my first or fifteenth choice, but it's got decent flavor and no real ugliness that you can get with many high gravity malt liquors."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.39,"You ever felt down on your luck or had a really hard day at work and was thirsty? Look no further then your local gas station, dive bar, or local beer store and pickup a tallboy size or if offered 40OZ of hurricane. Why did anheuser busch name it Hurricane. Well.. it depends on the batch brewed but your bound to have a Hurricane effect either emotionally, physically or psychologically from drinking it. I’ll leave the graphic effects out.

Nevertheless it is on par with its other contenders for pour, taste, smell and overall quality. Which is in a class of its own. It’s not terrible by any means. If consumed ice cold and drank fast before it changes internal temperatures fast it is worth every penny. If your looking to get drunk fast and you have a few bucks in your pocket this is the go to malt liquor. If you have a few more bucks do yourself a favor a look to the cabinet where a tall boy or 40oz is about a dollar more. You’ll thank yourself Later"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,4.17,"honestly a solid product, doesn't taste bad as long as its ice cold, the price is right when im broke, and the reactions i get at parties when drinking these is priceless. usually 1 or 2 people try it and end up changing their mind haha! far from a bum drink if you ask me"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.16,"Light gold body, clear; lively carbonation; thick white head, dense and foamy. Very faint aroma; just touch of graininess. Respectable flavor; grainy, sweet, and bitter with a fairly prominent alcohol presence; phenol suggestion. Medium-heavy body; some sticky residual sugar notes; somewhat dry with a strong alcohol effect.

A basic American malt liquor. It hits the ABV style squarely, has great looks, but little distinctive smell and the taste, while not bad, doesn't lend itself to repeat visits.

Poured at 42 °F; canning data on bottom of the can: 21269"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.06,"Purchased as a tall can at Exxon for $2.07. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Bright & clear gold with a one-finger quick-to-disappear pale white head.
S - Ethanol and corn come through first. Cracker and grass.
T - Lightly-browned toast and generic cereal grains. Wet hay and ethanol on the finish. Fairly sweet throughout.
F - Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation. Refreshing, but you likely won't reach for another. Dense.
O - Aside from reviewing it, I would only have this beer on two occasions: either with a friend while splitting a frozen pizza, or alone in a deep depressive state. This beer is the plastic jug vodka of beers. Depressing, terrible, but not as bad as it could get. If you're looking for all the beer part of a 4Loko with none of the added flavoring, this is as close as it gets. Would buy again, and would recommend trying at least once."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.47,"25oz can, poured into an Arcoroc nonic pint glass.

A - pours a golden yellow with a foamy white head and some lacing. Lots of small bubbles rising through the glass.

S - smells mostly of malts with some caramel. Very faint boozy and adjunct notes are present as well but are inoffensive.

T - True to the style, the taste is malt-forward with notes of caramel and toast mixed in. Some fusel notes appear as the brew warms. The sweetness of this HGML was softer than expected and is actually quite pleasant.

M - Medium-full-bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down smoothly with a dry finish.

O - Pleasantly surprised with this HGML. It's certainly much better than some of the others in its class. Tick completed."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.85,"Look: Pale yellow and clear. Two fingers of fizzy white head that quickly dissipates.

Smell: Sweet adjunct malt, slight citrus, slight metallic note.

Taste: Barely perceptible, crackery adjunct malt. No real hop flavor or bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Thin and highly carbonated.

Overall: Classic cheap malt liquor. Not outright disgusting (at least when cold), but extremely boring so you can chug a tallboy."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,1.93,"A-B's take on other high gravity malt liquors. Appearance is average. Smell is sweet. Taste is sweet and malty at first, but then it gets boozy. On my tongue, it felt slick and buttery. Probably won't have this again."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,1.87,"It is foamy but very pale. It straw and the head dissapears quickly. It smells metallic. The taste isn't strong but is sweet with a bad aftertaste. The feel is light and not bubbly enuf but bubbly. overall, good hurricane prerp."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.35,"Pours golden yellow with a one finger head.
The aroma is sweet cereal grains and not much else.
The flavor isn’t terrible, very sweet but not too offensive for the style. It drinks very smooth, dangerous at 8%,"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.6,"Much better than the original. While it still rates below average, it is miles better than the other. Best consumed ice cold. Pours a clear gold with a thin head. Smell is sweet and grainy. The taste follows, the sweet in this one is far superior to the taste of the original. If I rated it solely based on it being really cheap, it would probably be just about average"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,4.6,"Now, this review is not comparing this malt liquor to beers. This review is comparing this malt liquor to other malt liquors.

The Hurricane High Gravity pours quite well. It has a dark golden body and a small head.

The aroma it emits is one of sweet caramel.

The flavor also brings forth a sweet caramel taste, followed up by a bread-like flavor.

It is one of the smoothest and most appealing malt liquors I have tasted. Most malt liquors are consumed just for the alcohol percentage, this one actually tastes and feels good!

This malt liquor goes down VERY good."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,1.9,"Look: Looks like your typical nascar soda
Smell: Mine smells awful
Taste: Tastes okay, its almost like a less carbonated steel reserve. Really mild for the alcohol content though.
Feel: Like a ""smoother"" steel reserve
Overall: I make a couple references to steel reserve, which is my goto 'cheap' beer, and yeah... Definitely would take steel reserve over this."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.79,"I can't believe this beer was only a dollar and a half at my local liquor store! It's placed side-by-side with all the cheapo beers and malt liquors (Natty Daddy, Olde English 800, etc...). This malt liquor provides a surprisingly decent taste compared to the other counterparts that were place in the same area of price-range. I'd buy the canned version rather than the plastic 42oz bottle since I personally believe it tastes better.

Overall, this is an underrated malt liquor imho. Try it out for yourself! Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it tastes bad. :)"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.81,"25 Oz bottle poured into glass
Look - lots of bubbles, golden color. Foam is thicker than i anticipated.
Smell - not far off from Budweiser, stale rice and grains with some sweetness. Not too bad.
Taste - It's strong in terms of alcohol and it has some bold flavors. It's not that rough like some others are, and there is a slight (and I mean slight) hop presence. It is sweet, almost syrupy. Carbonation is high, about as high as a beer can get.

Overall, a little better than some others in this category. I wouldn't say i really enjoyed it but that's not really the purpose of it. There are plenty of great beers at 8% ABV. These are just barely drinkable and cheap to make so there is a market for them. Grade is a C-"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,1.06,"I am one who truly enjoys finding redeeming qualities in that which is under appreciated and overlooked, however there is simply none of that to be found in this truly hideous concoction.

Purchased west of Atlanta for a mere $1.29 in a 25 oz. can. Poured ice cold in a traditional Weizen glass. Thin soapy head dissipates very quickly to nothing leaving behind a single strand of bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Many malt liqours are criticized for being too flat but this far exceeds that stereotype even freshly poured and ice cold.

Look is somewhat appealing. Slightly off color golden straw, but with a slight hint of light brown overtones. The smell is truly acrid. Atrocious. Similar to being behind a sanitation truck with your windows down on 95 degree afternoon. Its that bad, even cold. Stale moldy bread comes to mind. Taste is similarly disgusting. It truly tastes like garbage and thats what gives this selection such low marks even against the basement low expectations in this style and class of beer.

Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy saliva consistency. Some reviewers here have described the taste as ""clean"" and perhaps my sample wasnt fresh, but I would never use the word clean to describe this brew. The fusel is very apparent in this brew, not in an astringent burning alcohol way, but you definitely get the impression of adjuncts and byproduct.

I have found that properly pouring lower quality beers ice cold in a weizen glass at the correct angle and giving them a chance to head up and breathe can really bring out the very best of their qualities and true potential, if any is to be found. Removing them from their humble confines of tall cans and forty bottles can really enhance the entire profile of even the lowest quality of beers. This would not be the case at all with Hurricane. Even the best possible treatment could not save this beer, it still tastes like nasty 40 swill no matter how it's treated.

Attempting to enjoy this while watching Oklahoma's defense attempt to stop Alabama was a similarly futile effort. Taking this down was a truly laborious task. I felt compelled to pour it down the drain more than once, but I wanted to give it an honest try, as many beers have the ability to change your impression from start to finish and various points in between. This, however, did not. Bad start, bad middle, worse end.

Drinkability and smoothness are the main reasons I opt for this style and class of beer. However this had none of the redeeming qualities you can find in its budget oriented diamond in the rough contemporaries. Drinking this truly harkened back to the high school days of slamming flat, warm, low quality beer with no enjoyment of flavor or experience, simply pursuing the effect alone.

But perhaps the effect is this beer's selling point. After drinking a single glass It certainly impairs, but in a very rough and very dirty feeling way. None of the slightly bubbly giggly pleasantness one can expect even from its low quality cousins. A single can literally weakened the knees and had me faintly stumbling upon standing. But at 25 ounces and 8.1% ABV, this is the alcohol equivalent to drinking 4-12 oz bud lights in quick succession. So while it certainly delivers in that regard, it's not at all what I would describe as a pleasant buzz. Very heavy and dizzy inducing. Two or three of these and your night would likely end in the spins.

Some might argue that its unfair to judge a beer in this class so harshly and say ""what did you expect."" 'You get what you pay for"", but for so many other offerings in this class you actually tend to get a bit more than what you paid for. Thats what I love about budget beers that are overlooked and underestimated. Even among high gravity malt liqours. So many of them perform so admirably in terms of smoothness, imminent drinkability, clean-ness and even flavor. I believe many of the cheapest beers would hold their own in blind taste tests against more expensive higher end lagers, with all but the most discerning of beer connoisseurs. Hurricane however, absolutely would not, and it lives down to all the stereotypes of poor, low quality malt liquor.

So if you find yourself at the end of the beer case in your local gas station with only 2 or 3 bucks to spare, eyeing the budget friendly varieties, or if your plan is to enjoy some forties with your friends in an exercise of campy irony, or if you just want a brief respite from the overt pretentiousness of craft beers today and simply want to enjoy a football game drinking the beer of the common man to feel how johnny paycheck lives, you would be much better served to reach for any of the other offerings on the shelf.

If you are unfimiliar with malt liquor and are simply curious to try it, please don't associate all malt liquors with this. Dont let this ruin malt liquor for you.

All things considered (smell, taste, mouthfeel, consistency, effect) this may very well be the worst beer I have ever tried."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,2.3,"Thursday, December 27, 2018 10:28 PM
24 ounce can poured to glass
Sight: Amber, appears clear, medium white head
Aroma: scent smell of malt
Taste: slight bitterness, some sweetness
Mouth feel: lively carbonation, good follow through, some tartness, dry finish, slightly bitter aftertaste
Overall: good beer, inexpensive, ok to repeat not look for"
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,4.62,"Drank from a 25 ounce can. Score is based on the style.

Look - The can almost looks a really nice, borderline classy matte white when covered in condensation. As it is wiped clean, the silver luster underneath reveals itself in a spectacular sheen. Although the ""Hurricane"" text looks quite cheap and like something you'd find on a toy airplane or similar, the ""High Gravity"" text, the cursive ""Malt Liquor,"" and the winged H logo lift it up to a fancier tier. If the can didn't instruct me to ""be bold, be smooth, be powerful"" and inform me that this drink was about to bring me ""an equally bold experience"" compared to a category 5 hurricane, I would give this can perfect marks.

Smell - Strong odors of sweetcorn, wet grain, fresh cut grass. Typical smells I'd expect from an AAL, but from a gas station malt liquor tall boy? This one has my attention.

Taste - Surprisingly hits you with a pleasant explosion of flavor. Most malt liquors have an instant or very quick repulsion to them, but this one is somehow enjoyable. Very sweet caramel and milk chocolate tones to start tamper down to a typical bready lager flavor that finishes on a weird combination of vanilla pudding and bell pepper. I am shocked at how much I like this.

Feel - Normally these high alcohol ultra-cheap beers have a bit of a sting to them, but this one is quite mellow and goes down easy. The normal medium-thin body you'd expect from a malt liquor, but maybe just a hair under the usual extra-bubbly carbonation in other examples.

Overall - I never though Mickey's would be toppled as my favorite malt liquor, but Hurricane might have just done it. Everything about this beer was a pleasant surprise to me. A weird amount of complexity and enjoyability out of a $1.50 gas station pick. To anybody who likes drinking bottom-shelf beer as much as I do, this one is a real winner, and if you get the chance, try it yourself."
Worst,Hurricane High Gravity,3.02,"Appearance:
Pours to one finger head that eventually falls to nearly nothing. No lacing. Clear light gold.

Aroma:
Cereal grains, cider, slight malt and alcohol, slight solvent/fusel oils

Flavor:
Clean and sweet. No hop presence. Slight malt at the finish.

Mouthfeel:
Medium. Moderate to High CO2. No astringency. Slightly sugary and warming.

Overall:
For what it is, cheap, clean, sweet alcohol beverage, it is OK. It is engineered for a purpose and fits that purpose well."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.41,"The best way to describe Game Day Light is to use simple words, as this is a simple beer. The flavor can be best described as musty. The carbonation is overbearing and chafing to the mouth. The aroma is of overly ripe fruit (Grapes or plums). It has a strong head... Which burns out to reveal the aforementioned molten carbonation.

However when purchased for a song at 3.99 USD for a twelve pack of cans or even at a slightly higher 5.99 USD it can be a pleasure to drink like water and a painful tincture to imbibe quickly. I can personally attest that after nearly drinking a pallet of this beer it can liven up a party with a lack of beverages very quickly.

If you have to have a beer which you can enjoy taste-wise and you are tight on cash, look elsewhere. A malt liquor might simply be a better choice. If you need a beer that will ensure some intoxication at a decent price this is probably a poor choice, but it is an option which can be exercised."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.09,"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with watery malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a poor beer that lives up to the light name with some watery and bland flavors."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.65,"Poured very pale gold into a shaker pint glass. Three fingers of white head. Head becomes a ring toward the bottom. A nice sheet of fine lacing on one side of the glass.
Smells slightly grainy. Taste is sweet and very light. A bit like that sparkling cider that non-drinkers buy for champagne substitute only very watered down. No real hop presence detected. Mouthfeel was thin but O.K. on the carbonation. Overall a beer that was worth every penny of the $2.99 for the 12-pack. A great beer for the people that dislike hops or anything bitter. Cheaper than Coke, Pepsi, and most bottled water. Works out to 25 cents per beer. Wow."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.98,"NOTE:: Im giving this beer a fair chance. I didnt even look at previous, or average ratings.

A: Very light yellow... like a stained antique newspaper you'd find in an old writing desk.

S: Smells like champange.... Sparkling white wine... whatever you want to call it, but it smells exactly like a brut.

T: Very light and lacking any sort of depth. Sort of tastes like watered down grape juice. I dont know where the beer is in this. Honestly. Tastes just roll off the tounge too quickly, im going to say it tastes a little like lemon, sprite, white grapes, and poland spring water. Tastes a little bit like perfume too, in a bad way.

M: Legitimately not even there. In all fairness, im sure they were going for the taste of perfumed water, but its just not acceptable.

O: im sure my biases kicked in, and told me to reject the light macro beer before me, but i really did give it a chance. Im probably not going to finish the can, esspecially knowing i have other beers in the fridge. I could only drink this if i were dying of thirst. Simple."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.89,"From 24 fl. oz. can no. 0750-2004. Sampled on June 6, 2011. The pour is straw, pale yellow with a lot of fizzy white head at first that bubbles down quickly like a soft drink. The aroma is made up of adjuncts like corn and rice and virtually no malts or hops to speak of. The body is very thin like water. The taste is quite intolerable with a flat, adjunct-laden chemical-type character although there are some hops on the tail end...just barely. This one is weaker than its regular beer sibling."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.82,"The CANQuest (TM) has morphed into an all-CANsuming focus for me in which I will simply drink any beer that comes in a CAN. I have reviewed some oddities before, but beer from 7-11?!? Ah, the memories of the mid-1970's. when we did not have a nearby 7-11 and had to wait for the annual Jersey shore trip to load up on their Marvel Comics Slushee cups ... How my 'rents ever put up with sucking those things down remains beyond my ken. We had a 7-11 in Lancaster, at James and Water Sts. for a short while, but those days are long gone. So's my Pops, in a random memory of the late-70's, on Labor Day weekend, taking my brother and I for the ice cream cookies that were sandwiched between oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate after watching several hours of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.

Crack & Glug Time: My aggressive pour netted me two fingers' of foamy, bone-white head that lasted about as long as the foam at high tide at the shore. Long Beach Island, in case you wondered. The Haven Beach Motel, in Beach Haven, run by Mr. Flynn, of Flynn Real Estate, LLC. Now, where was I? Oh my, but the nose had the grapiness of the G. D. Ice. Ouch and Ooof. That along with a metallic tang gets it an Epic Fail. Zounds! The color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin and the taste was present but unobtrusive. It was just bland as all get-out. It had a light bitterness but noting beyond that. Booooring! Not bad, but more towards Why Bother? 110 calories? I'm switching back to Corona Light! My buff figure CAN't handle this."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.48,"7/11 special. Pours a very pale, clear yellow with a huge, airy white head. Head fell relatively slow to just about nothing. No real lace.

Has a clean cereal and medical aroma. Not very inviting.

Taste is thin and again medical with a pronounced sweetness. Watery.

Very thin and watery mouthfeel with a slight tingle on the tongue.

Not good at all. Taste is really weak and really strange. Mass produced with cheap ingredients. Avoid."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.01,The appearance is pale gold with a medium head that fades to nothing. The aroma is almost non existent hints of sweet malt and corn with a touch of chemicals. The taste is like the aroma but not disgusting. The palate is thin. Overall this is pretty much what I expected.
Worst,Game Day Light,2.11,"Served in a Coca-Cola flared pint glass.

While visiting a nearby 7-11, I found myself face-to-face with this oddity. I was compelled to purchase and give it a go. It pours a ridiculously clear very pale straw topped by a quickly-disappearing finger of white fizz. Giving the surface a deep sniff, this beer has the same problem my boy Phil Fry once suffered from: it has no nose. I wanna say there's some watered-down corn syrup, but that could just be the air in my apartment (I think my air conditioner has issues). But, yeah, I smell nothing here, as though water were sitting in the glass. Hm. A taste yields some of that suspected corn syrup (swimming in what seems like an ocean), along with a hint of rice and a slight tinniness (I'm assuming from the can). There isn't much here to be objectionable, but that's mainly 'cause there ain't much here to begin with. The body is infused with helium, with barely any carbonation and a very watery feel. Like I've said before, it mostly seems like water. I have a sneaking suspicion 7-11's screwing with me by selling me a can of flavored water instead of an actual beer. Oh well, at least it goes down quick and easy. Boo this beer."

M - This beer has a light body with medium high carbonation to it

D - While this isn't the first I'd buy to take to the pool or a BBQ for what it is its not horrible if I ever get laid off again and become poor again I could see this being a regular in the fridge"
Worst,Game Day Light,1.2,"I picked this up in 24oz cans from 7-11.

Appearance: very pale yellow color with a huge white head which stayed around longer than its Ice counterpart.

Smell: Corn and malty sweetness. At least no cat pee.

Taste: There really is no taste to it. I'm really trying here to detect something but... I got nothing.

Mouthfeel: Very high carbonation but very thin and watery body.

Overall: I tried. That's really all I can say. This beer has no value to add to the current beer market. Not even those who drink the big boys BMC stuff will appreciate this one because there is nothing to appreciate about this beer. I predict that this beer won't last very long."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.65,"Ok, so I bought it in a can because it was a new beer on the shelf and it wasn't coors, miller, or busch. So even though it was metallic-tasting dishwater, I wanted to see if maybe the brewing revolution had come out with something in a can that isn't as bad as, well...beer in a can.

A = Thin, pale and yellow, like pee and every other canned beer out there

S = corny, the adjuncts and raw alcohol sweetness mix hit you right away

T = sweet, watery, fermented, dishwater with barley. Isn't beer supposed to have hops?

M = like any other mass-produced beer. thin, watery, soda-like carbonation

D = Hey, if I were back in the frat barracks days, I'd drink it if it were free."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.85,"Bought this at 7-Eleven after seeing 12-packs of them in the window. I had heard the convenience store chain was going to introduce their own brand of light beer so wanted to give it a try as I do with most new beers that come out. The price seemed very inexpensive. 24oz cans, 3 for $4. I decided to take the deal, bought two of the Game Day Lights and one Game Day Ice.

Appearance: Poured from can into a shaker glass. Color was very light, pale yellow in color. Crystal clear and a 1-inch white-frothy head that dissipated after about eight seconds. Lots of CO2 bubbles rising up to the surface.

Smell: Malt aroma is grainy, slightly sweet with a hint of corn and slight, spicy hop aroma. Little bit of DMS present.

Taste: Flavor is dry and crisp. Some corn-like sweetness and a graininess on the tongue. No real hop flavor and bitterness is very low.

Mouthfeel: Body of beer is very light and watery with a strong, carbonic bite.

Drinkability: It's a light, refreshing beer best served chilled and meant to be drank quickly. On a hot day when compared to other beers of the style I think it holds up. Not really impressive but also not disappointing. Cheap, cold and fizzy will be good enough for most, non-discriminating drinkers."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.58,"A buddy picked up a 12 pack of this, I figured why not give it a try. And yes, that is a rhetorical question.

A: A very pale yellow color as one might expect. The head is there and gone in an instant.

S: Surprisingly unoffensive in terms of the aroma. A bit of rice and water.

T: This tastes quite similar to Bud Light. A lot of water and rice and not much else, to be honest.

M: The body is very light with a tingly carbonation.

D: As light lagers go, this one was actually not too bad. I wouldn't really want to drink this as I prefer something with more flavor, but at least it wasn't offensive."
Worst,Game Day Light,2.5,"I decided to try this out of curiosity and I just happened to be in a mood where I could have gone the night without drinking a beer, anyway.
My choices were between GD Ice and GD Light, so I took the lesser of the 2 evils. Not being a fan of light beer, this one has that tell tale watery feel. It tastes like PBR cut with water. There isn't anything objectional or distasteful about it, it's just very watery. As someone who has been drinking my share of IPAs lately, I must admit that my beer buds might have been a little bit over worked...so to be totally fair, I think someone who likes light lager will like Game Day just fine."
Worst,Game Day Light,1.8,"bought from 711 on way back from class

D - aftertaste is killing me, this is Milwaukee Best Light level at best, not buying again"
Worst,Game Day Light,2.4,"Finally the much anticipated (for college kids at least) beer brewed for 7-Eleven hits shelves. No point in going through a full review because everybody knows that even before this brew came out what it was going to be all about. Pours like a BMC product, looks like a BMC product, and smells like PBR. If I had to categorize this beer it would be somewhere North of Natty Light and South of PBR. Is it any good? No. Is 7-Eleven going to sell a shit-load of it in college towns? Yes. You be the judge of that one."

Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1.88,"Expected this to drink harsh, with the primary peers being Icehouse Edge and Steel Reserve, and of course it drank harsh; this category is not at all for the drinking experience, rather for getting sloshed, so I don’t feel compelled to fault it for that, especially at its price point. It holds up well against IhE and SR overall, all things considered; but that’s really not saying much. However, theres an entirely unwelcome sweetness here that sometimes makes me wish I’d opted for the others. Still, at $1.69 per 25oz in my area, it easily wins against Icehouse Edge and Steel Reserve as the absolute most cost-effective buzz that can be had from beer and nowadays is actually cheaper than soft drinks. Ultimately achieves what it sets out to do, for what it’s worth."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1,I picked up a 12 pak of this just to try something different. Thank you to Anheuser Busch for allowing to experience what eating a yeast infected pussy tastes like.
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.73,"Poured from a 25oz can

Appearance is not promising on the pour large soda like bubbles that never get over 1 finger and very lively carbonation. Color is a dark straw to light gold. Looks like cheap lager. Head a few minutes in is just a ring around the glass.

Aroma is what you'd expect. Cheap beer. Not necessarily revolting but not appealing. It kind of just smells old and oxidized with a tart slightly off AAL lager yeast aroma. Zero hops detectable. Not great but I've smelled worse, unfortunately not many.

Flavor is not the same as the smell but not better. Very light malt forward but the off flavors creep in quickly. A slight tartness and alcohol bitterness and burn are all present. At first it reminded me of expired. budweiser with vodka in it. As you drink the 8% beer the flavor becomes more palatable. Not terrible but there's a lot off.

Feel is surprisingly easy to put down and the carbonation isn't too intense. The head comes back into existence a bit to give it some thickness and smoothen it out a little. It's drinkable but in the stomach it is quite heavy and the abv makes it a bit ridiculous that in the mouth at least it's this easy to drink quick.

Overall it's bad but not to the point where every sip is regret, and the ABV makes it get better over time. This beer certainly had a time and a place, but generally it's not a great one to be in. It gets you real drunk without being completely disgusting."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),3.04,"A - Pale gold colored pour with thin white lacing and moderate carbonation.

S - Crackery honey malt and corn.

T - Crackery honey malt, corn graininess, and alcohol.

M - Medium body with gentle carbonation.

O - This isn't as terrible as what everyone makes it out to be. I do agree with some reviewers, though ... the colder the better."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.57,"Well expectations were pretty low here, but I probably won't pursue another of these. Bang for buck tho, it's a serious winner at $1.50/24oz. Smell is just not right, hard to get past, and flavors follow. Definitely some off-flavors. Interesting to try nonetheless"
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.28,"Pours a clear, bright pissy looking yellow, white head actually hung around for 30 seconds before fading away, it even left a bit of spotty lacing. Snot locker gets some hay and corn, unfortunately, it tastes like it smells, maybe a little worse. Thin and watery with zero carbonation after the pour. I bought this to celebrate my 1400th beer on Untappd!"
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.57,"Compared to the usual gas station beer (Busch Light, Bud Light, Coors, etc.), it's got a little bit more flavor. Or course the malt has to balance out the higher alcohol content. It's definitely more drinkable than the classics like Colt 45 or Old English. However, it's still a low-end to average beer. The price point is great for the ABV but you're getting a similar quality as others at this price point."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.04,"Pours golden yellow with a 1/4"" white head, which dissipates. Light lacing.

Aroma is phenolic, corn, metal.

Taste is rather bland. Bread, corn, grass. Very little hop flavor.

Thin body, moderate carbonation. Dry finish.

They should call this ""Ratty Daddy"". Not a lot of aroma or flavor. Wouldn't care for this again."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.95,"Sampling this 25 oz can cold and poured into my .5L dimple mug. Picked up can today and its been in my fridge for a few hours.
The beer pours a bright clear golden color with a frothy bleached white head of almost 2 cm. This foam fades quickly to a thin edging and one wispy island in the center of my glass.
The aroma is very mild on this brew. I get a little bit of grainy malt and some corn and apple juice notes. Smell is generally sweet and almost not there, maybe too cold?
First sip reveals a light body with very fine and slightly tingly carbonation. Slightly sticky mouthfeel that coats my lips on each sip. Goes down very easy each mouthful
Flavor is bolder than the nose and has similar components. I get some grain and corn and again apple juice sweetness. No hops to note and the ABV is hidden as well.
This beer drinks super easy, has pretty good kick and cost me $1.59 for the 25 oz can. Pretty good value if you are looking to forget about things for a while. I do find it pretty boring and not very flavorful. Wont be buying again as this we as for the Malt Liquor tasting."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.93,"This beer obviously has more alcohol than its non-Daddy namesake, but it has some familiarity with it (or really any American AAL). It's probably a little sweeter at the end of the day, but it mostly came across as rather bland, were it not for the carbonation providing a little bit of excitement.

Adjuncts (corn) seem to be involved with the malt, and while I got no hop profile, something had to have been used to keep this things from out-of-control sweetness. The main thing I got that wasn't generic was some red delicious apple.

I am going with an ok offering, since it avoided offense, but to me it was more that there just wasn't a whole lot to like or dislike."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.23,"Tastes horrible. Smells horrible. Big ol' can. Gets you messed up on a budget. 8%, cheap and efficient. Only recommend if you don't have much money and you want to get faded. Grab 2 or 3 of these and they'll get you there. I would never choose this if I had enough money for some decent liquor."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1.53,"16oz pounder

Looks like urine, smells and tastes like metallic urine. This has a funk to it, and is one of my least favorite all-time beers. Somehow I can't escape it.

I can't fathom how some people I know love this stuff..."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.15,Big beer with a blah taste. Notes of corn and metal - too sweet on the corn. Tried this at my father-in-laws. He gave it to me because it was something somebody left in the fridge - will not revisit this one.
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1.9,"Tried this stuff because it was the only thing available in cans. It's basically tasteless, but somehow gives me heartburn. Also doubt the 8% abv, more like 5%. It should be $0.25 a can. The supply shortages have induced me to try a lot of new beers. Incredibly this was not the worst."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),3.32,What can I say. Natty Daddy is tried and true at getting you where you want to go. There is only one stop on the Natty Daddy train and that stop is straight intoxication to the dome. This is not for the light of heart. If you are ever in a pinch grab yourself 2 tallboys for $2.30 and have yourself a time.
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),3.52,"What can I say that hasn't been said before about Natty Daddy, it gets you where you wanna go. When I drink it, it makes me feel like a black out Julian Casablancas. Nothing like casually having a shower Natty Daddy or a Natty Daddy during Friday beers. If I had to associate Natty Daddy with an album it would be Is This It, And Room On Fire by The Strokes.
For that I rate it 4 stars out of 5."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.16,"What can I say about Natty Daddy? It does it's job, and it does it well. It's a cheap gas-station beer through-and-through. The price reflects this. You can get a 25 fluid ounce can for next to nothing. The look of the can portrays it's brand well; it's here. It's bold. It's gonna get you fucked up. It smells the same way it tastes; not great. But hell, for this cheap, who gives a fuck. The taste is sort of hard to describe to be honest. It tastes sort of like perfume/nail polish/rust/cheap beer. Like, that's literally the best mix I can describe. It's fucked. But again, who gives a shit. You need to get drunk quickly, and cheaply. If that sounds like you, this isn't a bad option. The feel is actually decently smooth for the price tag. Overall, it's fucking Natty Daddy. We all have drank it once in our life. So what are you waiting for? Go drink it you Neanderthal."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1.6,"I hate Nasty Daddy with a passion and if this was the only beer available in the market, I would never drink beer! Adjunct lagers should not taste this poorly, and there are brands less expensive. If you drink this crap, you are ridiculous!"
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.36,"It has a rusty taste like if it was made of water with a high concentration of dissolved iron. It also often tastes after apples like if the hard apple cider or its destilate was mixed in. It's a low quality beer BUT it is indisputable winner in a cathegory of price per alcoholic content. The affordability of 25oz of 8% alcohol in Natty Daddy can be beaten only by the price of 24oz of 8.1% alcohol in Steel Reserve or the price of 24oz of 8% alcohol in Edge brand. Steel Reserve and Edge taste much better and feel much more ""beerish"" than ND. But they usually cost few dimes more than ND. In case all 3 contestants cost the same money I definitely go for Edge or Steel Reserve instead of ND.
I give Natty Daddy 3/5 overall. Although it does not taste very well, it also does not pretend to be what it isn't. The price is perfectly adequate to the quality and presents even a better deal for those who focus merely on quantity of ethanol."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),1.44,"Yah, so the first sip wasn’t that bad. It actually kinda tasted like cider. Then, well, it’ went down hill, like full tuck on the downhill bad. Awful. Straight metal. I mean it was just jet fuel. Each sip made me want to just throw the beer down the drain more and more. At 8.0 it certainly gets you... going. But it tastes like you just licked a gas pump. Don’t buy unless you really need it..."
Worst,Natty Daddy (8%),2.73,"Grabbed a Natty Ice and this - the Ice was terrific but this was not - runs a little sweet, a little syrupy - kind of akin to a Colt 45, but less sweet and lighter- bodied - so better than that but too much like corn syrup for me"
Worst,Budweiser 66,1.8,"A 300ml clear glass bottle with a BB of March 2013. The label states that it is brewed in the UK, and describes it as lightly carbonated with a smooth, easy taste. Sounds like bollocks to me.

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear pale straw colour with light carbonation. A hard pour results in a large head of white foam that disappears rapidly. Aroma of almost nothing; initially some faint malt and little else. As it warms, unwelcome hints of stewed corn and sulphur appear. Gross.

Tastes of ultra-light malt with a faint sweetness. No hops or bitterness whatsoever. This could well be the most flavourless beer I've ever tried. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with a mild tingly dryness. No body - could pass as mineral water. A weak aftertaste of stewed veg.

Crap. This has to be the blandest, most characterless brew ever to pass my lips. Almost no taste, a weak and unpleasant aroma, and no body or depth. Just bad on every level. Avoid at all costs!"
Worst,Budweiser 66,1.22,"A - Very pale yellow with absolutely no head at all. A couple of tiny bubbles rising to the surface too but not many.

S - Hardly any smell at all, mainly a very faint sweet smell but bland for the most part.

T - Very bland again for the most part although it finishes with a sugary, sweet kind of taste.

M - Very light bodied & smooth going down with very little carbonation.

D - This beer has absolutely no taste other than a very faint, sugar like finish & the fact that there was no head at all when I poured it suggests it should be avoided. It tastes so much like water than I wouldn't even call it beer.

Worst,Budweiser 66,1.09,"This beer is brewed for the UK market only (I am lead to believe), God knows where it is actually produced.

Clear 300ml bottle, the cap already promised to a BA in the US. 'jermsumm' gets it in my next package.

The brew number is a special one, it means something to a lot of British people, which is obviously why Bud choose 66.

When a Brit hears the number 66 it reminds him of different things, depending on age and education. 1066 The Battle of Hastings, where we defeated an invading French army: 1666 The Great Fire of London, 1966 When England won the football World Cup for the first and only time, or the iconic Route 66 from Chicago to LA: However, a number between 65 and 67 is what it'll mean to most who buy this beer (if they can count that high).

I poured the beer into a Hoegaarden Crand Cru stemmed tulip glass to give it some class (this failed to have the desired effect).

It looked like a regular lager/pilsner/helles, golden clear, clean and bright. The white head leaving before it had fully arrived, a trait I hate.

You'll not be suprised to hear the beer had very little aroma or taste, in fact it reminded me of fizzy water such was its characterless, gassy, flavourless make-up. Perhaps I'm being unkind here, hey, no I'm not, this beer is terrible to the core (if it had a core to be terrible too).

There was a mini hint of sweetness from something, but I couldn't detect any hop, malt or yeast involvement what-so-ever it this so called brew. Most likely the worst beer I've ever reviewed since joining this site.

My son-in-law bought me this on his first anniversary of his marriage to my daughter, can't wait for next years treat!"
Worst,Hite,2.95,"Light and easy drinking with hints of sweetness, even a bit of lemon-lime soda, on the nose that reflect in the taste as well. One of those not a lot to laud or complain about."
Worst,Hite,2.5,"330 ml bottle, from Green Peas, Stavanger. ABV is 4.3%. Crystal clear pale golden colour, moderate white head. Sweetish aroma of pilsener malts, grass and maize. Light bodied, citric mouthfeel. Sweet and citric flavour, notes of grass and maize again, a modest bitterness."
Worst,Hite,2.67,"Drink it cold. As cold as you can get this. Pours clear, minimal aroma, bland fizzy flavor, quick finish. This comes in cans, bottles, and even plastic bottles, so that’s something."
Worst,Hite,2.93,"This is not a great beer. Not even really a good one. But I love it. For some reason, I always seem to have a case of it in the house. It's bland and boring, has no real taste to it. But it's another beer that's fantastic on a hot day. If you want hops or anything beyond the malt and rice, this is going to be very disappointing. But taken for what it is, the SK rendition of Budweiser, I kind of dig it."
Worst,Hite,2.82,"Drink this a lot back in old days in Korea because I was a college student with tight budget. Typical but blend Pale Lager, and it is easy to drink, gives you refresh feelings... Does not have rich aroma. Lack of body. Even nowadays in Korea, this beer isn't for savoring, but to mix with soju, making higher alcohol content which is called 'Somac' (Soju + Macju(beer)) so Korean people who tend to enjoy binge drinking can get drunk easily. Few weeks ago, I went to local Vietnamese restaurant and they had this beer for their beer menu. It gives me nostalgic feeling but skipped and ordered 'tiger' from Singapore. I would drink Hite beer again, if I only meet my good old friends from high school or college at neighborhood tavern."
Worst,Hite,2.99,"Another Asian beer that probably tastes better because of drinking in its home country.

Nothing overly special. Taste is crisp and clean, look is that of a typical lager.

Refreshing and light."
Worst,Hite,4.5,"Hite (Extra Cold) has a very thick, frothy, mousse-like head, heavy glass lacing, bubbles, and a mostly clear, straw appearance, with lots of fine, powdery sediment, throughout. Aroma is of pungent, yeasty, sweet, white bread, with grass note, and the flavor is similar and balance. Mouthfeel is medium, and Hite finishes mostly dry.

RJT"
Worst,Hite,3.25,"Ok this is not a beer that you sip for appreciating the nuances of its bouquet and complex flavors. This is a light, crisp rice lager that's best drunk ice cold in order to wash down a spicy Asian meal or better yet, a grill-at-the-table Korean BBQ. For this purpose, there's none better IMHO. That's why it'll be hard to find a Korean restaurant that does not have this brew on its menu."
Worst,Hite,2.59,"Pours an amber-golden color with a vanishing, medium sized head.

Smells of toffee wrapped straw and a light herbal note on top.

Has a fizzy, superlight mouthfeel, thin and highly carbonated.

Tastes basically as the beer smells, sweet malts among a metallic, bubbly carbonation and an omnipresent watery flavor hole. Develops a surprising dry note during the finish.

Insustrial lager, too light, too thin, too boring."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.49,Remember the heavy returnable cases? Local store had this in stock with those that looked the same as those from the early 90’s. Just had to get one for old times sake. Just a basic beer to have on a Saturday afternoon. No complaints.
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.47,"Please delete if you choose to do so.
Trigger warning: the last time I drank a delicious can of Blatz Beer was around 1979 so in some respects this review is for historical reasons only.

My local beer shop on State Street in Madison Wisconsin sold Blatz way back when. I bought several 12 packs over the course of a few months and walked home 2 to 3 miles with the 12-pack on my shoulder back to my apartment on Spring Street.

Back then, Blatz was a welcome alternative to the national and regional beers available at the time. It wasn't promoted or expected to be all-star or world class, just a solid brew that you might prefer to Old Style, Schmidt, Miller etc,

All good things come to an end. After 8-10 six-packs I got tired of the taste and moved on to other brews. I remember the store clerk telling me that they had Blatz Beer on sale for xx dollars. Didn't matter, I was tired of the beer."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.46,"Hard to find around me . Usually pick it up at reisbacks in zanesville oh . My uncle's drank the hell out of this back in the 80s . Kind of sweet an light bodied for a non lite aal. Just has a better taste than some of my other cheap go -tos. Like I said , you just don't see it around central Ohio everyday , and it's always the cans , you never see the little brown bottles anymore."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.8,"Pours a standard translucent gold with a fluffy white head that's thinner than expected and dissipates relatively quickly. It smells slightly sweet, but has a very thick barley forward smell with a hint of grassy hops and a touch of wet corny sweetness. The taste is fuller than expected with a bigger malt presence than most and has a slightly hoppy edge to keep it from being sweet. It's thicker feeling without being thick like a Schlitz or a non adjuncted lager. It goes down like a light lager but it's not. Overall the sum is greater than it's parts on this one. Pick it up if you want to drink something you've never had before."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.34,"At fifty cents per can, Blatz is a fine COVID-19 low-cost adult beverage. Decent light lager taste, good carbonation. Expect this to be a great summer quaff"
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.03,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The logo is incredibly attractive, but the can as an ensemble isn't that great. The silver color doesn't draw me in, and the tessellated little Blatz words across the can just clutter things up.

Smell - Very faint metallic sweetness. Maybe some grape? Not much there.

Taste - The first thing that comes to mind is cream soda. Somewhat vanilla sweetness, but even with its lightness, it still begs for some bitterness to round it out.

Feel - Thin body with a pleasant amount of fizz. Goes down quite easy.

Overall - I was hoping to find a new hipster-y grandpa beer to love, but this one is pretty lame. Not bad nor good, I don't know when I'll get back to it after this."
Worst,Blatz Beer,2.8,"Part of my old school macro rotation. Mouth feel is very light as is beer taste, mild carbonation and very little aftertaste. Good summer beer - excellent on a hot day, cold with a burger or sandwich. Can knock a bunch of these down, get a cool buzz and not feel it the next day. Always a plus."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.85,"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 10/14/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the better AAL I've had, as expected of Pabst."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.36,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, some sweetness. Taste is malts, grains, a bit on the sweet side, highly crushable. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall, at this price point, I have no complaints."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3,"Nothing special, nothing offensive, it is what it is- a better than average really cheap beer. It is a regular in my cheap beer rotation especially in the summer."
Worst,Blatz Beer,2.15,"One of the first beers I ever had, and I do not recall it fondly. Now this is almost 40 years ago, so reviewing it now is patently unfair, but so be it. I do recall one thing about this beer fondly. My granddad owned a bar and my dad would work for him when he needed help. Part of his payment would be cases of Blatz. What I liked was the case the beer came in. Heavy cardboard, with a split top that opened and closed over 12 bottles each. We had stacks of those in our garage. Damn good memory from bygone days."
Worst,Blatz Beer,4,"Pours a clear pale golden color with a fair head and spot of lacing, aroma grain and hint of malt sweetness. Taste of light malt sweetness and grain. Mild bitterness and fairly clean finish, light body, smooth with no real redeeming value."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.4,"Look: Decent head with the classic beer color. Ask most people to point to what they think of as beer and they will point to this. Pleasant, sweet, aroma. Tastes like what most people would recognize as beer. Yes, it is an adjunct but it hides the fact reasonably well.

Beer snobs like to rip on basic lagers, especially when they're relatively cheap. The bottom line is, this isn't a bad beer, especially for the price. No obvious corn or rice flavor to it, no unpleasant smell or taste. On a warm summer day, I can think of a lot worse beers to be drinking, even highly rated craft beers. If I went to someone's house and offered me one, I'd gladly accept it. If they were good company and I didn't have to worry about driving home, I'd have a few more."
Worst,Blatz Beer,2,No comment....the name kind of says it all. This is one of those cheapies we would raid from the old man's supply when I was way before legal age. No offense intended to all of you loyal Blatz drinkers.
Worst,Blatz Beer,4.44,"Blatz is quite good. It is refreshing and it also comes in an exceptionally sturdy cardboard box that can be repurposed for many years to come. The 24 pack of bottles generally runs about 15 dollars and the beer is quite good, several bottles can be drunk with no major problems. Many of the craft/special beers, which are good in their own right, can contain lots of alcohol and other chemicals that cause the drinker to become drunk and sick after only drinking one or two beers. Blatz is so well balanced that the enjoyment can be prolonged well into the 4th or 5th beer making the total experience on par with or exceeding that of some of the very rich and chemical laden craft-type beers."
Worst,Blatz Beer,3.16,"Sometimes you just have sentimental favorites even though you know that it objectively isn't the greatest thing in the world. With that said, welcome to applicability, my Blatz review.

You get that macro yellow, small 1/3"" white head. Aroma smells like mass production and grains.

Super carbonated, long boil high alpha acid non proprietary Cascade and noble hops? This is my party beer. Good in so many situations, reliable, cheap. Its not my go to for hops, malt or yeast (which is kinda fruity here, that or its the corn adjunct).

Good for camping, fishing, shooting, golf, partying, palate cleanser, whatever floats your boat."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.32,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Unlike Mountain Crest, the dated look of this can isn't that charming. The design is gross and old looking, no allure to be found here. I guess it's functional, but it's not good.

Smell - Incredibly beyond balanced malty, yet almost on the verge of nothingness. A truly min-max scent.

Taste - On the verge of being too sweet, but right at the turning point, the dirty bitter alcohol cuts in firmly. The best descriptor for this is grungy. You can taste the cheapness.

Feel - Chocolate milk? It's silky and creamy, but it feels like something I don't want. I can't say it's bad, but it's just not what I'm looking for.

Overall - Mountain Crest was surprising and exciting, but this is just lackluster and disappointing. I guess it would make a good party beer at $13 a case and 6.2% alcohol, but that's the only situation I can see it in."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1.5,"Appearance - Medium-light gold. A little red, too. Clear. Not as bubbly as I would have hoped. Thin and immediately disappearing head.

Smell - Not strong. What's there is sweet pale malt. Sugary corn.

Taste - Excessively, cloyingly, sickeningly sweet. Sugar and grain. Ack.

Mouthfeel - Light.

Overall - Not good. Not good."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.91,"Poured from a can into a Perfect Pint.

A=Darker gold color, much darker than AAL's and more appealing...also a nice frothy head.

S=Overly sweet...probably due to the adjuncts.

T=Syrupy sweet...hint of honey and apple.

M=A bit syrupy with a bit too much carbonation.

O=Too sweet for my liking...may be interesting as a cheap lager for a snakebite."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2,"Another can for the collection, compliments of Minhas. Glad I have a couple trade partners to share this with.
Not exactly sure what they we trying to acheive in this ""strong ice beer"" - high alcohol, low price to compete with other malt liquors. Gold color, fizzy head that quickly disappears to nothing. Almost no aroma, maybe wet straw or grain, kind of sweet smell. First taste is sour on the tongue. Watery and thin, no body, and an alcohol after taste. Should have known better : High alcohol % plus low cost equals no good."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.65,"Clear Creek Ice has a thick, white head and a mostly clear, bright, golden appearance, with lots of bubbles streaming up, but not much lacing left behind. The aroma is subtle at best, but one can detect some water and slight grain. Taste is strongly alcoholic, with some sweetness, grains, a touch of hops, and water. Overall, this is a mostly malty and boozy concoction. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Clear Creek Ice finishes mostly dry, easy drinking, and smooth. I liked this. It has character. I recommend it.

RJT"
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1.95,"Pale golden appearance with lots of bubbly head that sticks around. Very sweet, corn smell with a hint of booze and metal.

Taste has an overpowering sweetness, picked up some corn and grain as well. Booze is evident, the taste is very stale. Light-moderate body with high carbonation. Aftertaste has a lingering sweetness.

Could be an average malt liquor, but the sweetness makes the beer disgusting. Only try if your already drunk and can't notice the taste."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.23,"Pours a hazy, orange-gold in color, topped with a tightly-frothed head of good duration. Good lacing, not a bad looking beer overall...

The nose is a pungent, adjunct-laden mess full of vegetal off-notes and boozy goodness -- in other words, quite average for the style ; )

On the first sip this is sweet and slightly-sour/astringent, with broad honey-like notes. Fusel alcohol is also present from the get-go, and perhaps not an altogether bad thing considering the fact that it's to be expected for the style and this beer was purchased solely for the bang-for-buck factor.

Mouthfeel is average, drinkability is slightly better than average, but I'm setting both of these sliding determinants at ""average"" and ramping up the taste a bit to 'better than average' -- for what it is it's a drinkable beer, and I've certainly enjoyed worse from other breweries over the years.

Now, I wonder how it would compare in a side-by-side with ""Simpler Times"" . . .

P.S. / EDIT: Clear Creek Ice tastes a bit like ""Earthquake"", only watered-down for those who are still at 'entry level' in terms of their appreciation of street life : /"
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1,"Thanks to woodychandler for the CANned swill!

Pours a pale golden color with an odd haziness, bright white head and lots of bubbles.

Smells cold, with a bit of metal. Thats it.

""Oh my God."" That's all I could say. It's retched. And there is a stale, year old, bubble gum-like sweetness that that is unbearable. Sorry Woody, I couldn't even GLUG it!

The feel is awful, and it's entirely undrinkable.

However, my drain found it very easy to drink..."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1.59,"I remember when the introduction of this brand was a welcome, and momentarily potential threat to Molson hegemony around here. Ahhh, unsquelched hope...

This beer pours a clear pale golden colour, with two fingers of thin foamy white head, which leaves some very thin tiered lace around the glass as it quickly abates. It smells of sweet, sickly cornmeal and sugary alcohol. The taste is creamed corn and nail polish remover, mixed with sugar solution. The carbonation is moderate dull (in a flat soda sense), the body medium weight, and cloying as all get out. It finishes sweet, in the aforementioned wrong ways.

Good news for those who buy this crap for the extra booze - you can`t really taste it amongst the suckling sweetness. Enjoy your 12 packs, boyz..."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.38,"I found this randomly at a beer distributer in Pittsburgh. It was cheap, $10.50 for a case, so that's basically why I bought it. It was labeled ""craft brewed,"" and that actually put me over the top. I mean, how bad could it be if it at least claimed it was craft brewed.

At 6.2%, it's a heavy brew. I didn't realize it was a malt liquor until I ventured to BA. I sipped this curiosity with an open mind dispute the mostly negative reviews here.

The beer poured a thick, creamy yet ultimately slight-tasting head. Mouthfeel was actually really good, probably the best aspect of the beer. Taste was smooth, slightly citrusy. Good lacing on the pint glass. Taste was nothing like any malt liquor I've ever had.

In comparing it to bold-flavored craft brews, it actually can hold a candle. Don't get me wrong, this isn't 60 Minute, but it a simple, tasty, cheap beer."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.65,"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts. Taste is not so good, plastic, overly sweet, other undetectable flavors,not very enjoyable. Feels light in the mouth and is not very drinkable. Overall this is a sub-par beer."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1.61,"Another powerhouse beer from Wisconsin. I feel I have been spoiling myself with the generaly good beers I have reviewed. I decided to change it up and review a popular seller, based solely on cost and alcohol content...how bad could this be?

A: The head comes like a raging hurricane hitting the coast, leaving almost nothing it its path. When the storm finally subsides, there is a small amount of clear liquid puddle. It is a strange pale yellowish, perhaps from the farm land swept along the way.

S: Corn-Metal stale'ness. Smells like the beer left over from a college frat party. The remains of beer pong the night before. Maybe Clear creek ice is a mutation from Keystone Light, after it sits long enough, it transforms.

T: Sweet corn taste, high fructose syrup in some capacity. Similar metallic taste which I smelled before.

M/D: Very Light, high carbonation. If anything postive can be said about this beer, mouthfeel isn't great but ok, at least until you swallow it.

After all is said and done, it's exactly what I expected. It has the bare minimum in every category to make it drinkable. Add to it the fact the it is only 50 cents a can and 6.2% abv, and you have a popular beer. If those were the criteria, it would be on BA's Top 100 list."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1,"Oh, my dear and close buddies at Minhas ... I CAN't wait to do a Crack & Glug of this latest of your beers. You are ""Union Made"", a ""Craft Brewery"" and your website is DamnGoodBeer.com and yet you are my anathema. Why is that, do you suppose? More ammo for my argument forthcoming ...

I could smell the plastics factory as soon as I did the Crack action. OMFG! In the early iterations of Doctor Who, the Cybermen were molded from plastic. Is Minhas a cover for a Cybermen production facility?!? What is that noise in my backyard? ""You will be upgraded shortly. Stand by."" Nooo!

I'm back. A lovely thick head of bone-white beauty with perfect retention. Color was exactly as The CyberLeader ordered, I mean, a deep gold to offset our aluminum-colored suits, I mean with NE-quality clarity, whatever that may have meant to the former human entity who is now Cyberman # 30993. Never mind the off-task musings that are still filtering through. Nose was a perfect accompaniment to the melange here in the Upgrade Facility with a definite smell of plastics accompanied by cotton candy to increase the feel-good factor during said upgrade. Mouthfeel was medium with a beautifully pleasant taste of ... No, what have you done to me? It tasted like an admixture of perfume and plastic, like a scented Barbie doll. ""You will obey the CyberLeader and enjoy your beverage!"" Ooof, it's another Epic Fail on the part of Minhas, but they don't care. They're out to subvert us all! ""You will be re-upgraded."" Nooo. This beer stinks and I wouldn't feed it to a cybernetic hybrid under even the worst of circumstances. Finish was sickeningly sweet. Now, I want the upgrade so as not to have to taste it ever again.

Re-Upgrade complete. # 30993 now in complete compliance with Minhas plan Sol3. Lovely beer. Yum yum."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.55,"poured into a chimay chalice and paired with dorito's late night all nighter cheeseburger chips, totally taste like McDonald's. Kinda creepy

a- water clear, pale corn yellow, some foam, blink, no foam

t- at least the 6.2% abv covers up the actual taste, minhas light's another story.

T: water. slight beer aftertaste.

MF/D: thin, regretting putting this liquid in my mouth. i may apologize to my taste buds. do i have to finish this? followed by Doritos Late Night All-nighter Cheeseburger chips. might be worse than the beer. oddly they compliment each other well."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,1.98,"couldn't drink this straight, so i made a little shandy. poured out of an ice-cold can into a Ball jar with lemon nectar and ice.
on its own, this was a sickly sweet alcohol bomb with nothing supporting it. with lemon and ice it becomes eminently drinkable. i'm rating the beer as it is sold, though. 0.5 imaginary points (maybe factored into drinkability?) for being economical: $2.29 for a 4-pack."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.31,"Had this the other day at band practice. I usually bring over some PBR to drink and well this time beer was there and it was this!

A- Pours a very light almost clear yellow color. Half finger bright white head comes and goes with no lacing on the glass.

S- Grain, sweet alcohol, corn, and metal. This is what makes up the light aroma in the beer. To be honest it just smells too sweet before I even taste it.

T- Super sweetness to this beer. Nothing special about it at all. Sweet corn, light metal taste, grainy, and well some light sweet alcohol in the backend.

M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation actually is good for the style...not overly with some other macros. Sickly sweet on the palate and sweet alcohol in the aftertaste. Metal taste throughout the beer as it warms more and more. Bland tasting and watered down.

D- This is a average drinker. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it but it was there and I had to take my time with the first couple. I think I'll stick with my Pabst as a thrist quencher as I practice with the band."

S-Faint malts, yeast, and metal detected.
T-On the uptake it was ultra simple with a bit of hops in midsip closing out with a sicky sweet malt liqour-esque finish/ after-taste.
M-It comes on light and frothy and finishes thicker and lingering.
D-At the same price point as Mountain Creek and Minhas light I would say it is very drinkable for an ajunct macro."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.43,"Coming from someone who usually associates Malt Liquor with Colt 45, St. Ides, and Olde English 800, this is a nice change of pace. I bought this in a 4 pack of 16 Oz cans for $2.79, and wasn't expecting much. However, it's quite sweet when you first drink it, with not to strong an aftertaste. I could see some lady friends of mine enjoying this, and not complaining about it's lack of ""skunk"" that is usually associated with Malt Liquors.

I'm very impressed with this beer, and recommend it to anyone looking for a beer that has decent flavor but not the aftertaste of a usual malt liquor. It's a deceiving 6.2% alcohol, which is never a bad thing."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.53,"my can is dubbed 'tundra ice' and has football graphics on it for the Grey Cup, it's also 'Rider Green'... all unlicensed.

anyway, it's a 710ml can that was $2.60 for 6.2%, i bought 3 as novelties to give away to friends that were already hammed at the Grey Cup party.

i ended up with one, onto the review.

i poured half of it into a glass to check it out.

A: golden with a thick fluffy, soon to be gone head.

S: metalic corn, some grain smell. overall sweet smell.

T: faint malt, more corn than anything, quite sweet. didn't like it.

M: thickens up and doesn't feel too bad, this was the highlight for me.

D: if you're gunned, this would be great.

if price was a factor, this would score extra points as it truly is budget. it passes, but definately not something to drink if you're into flavor and presentation."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.03,"This stuff goes for $8.99 a case, how can you pass that up?

Dark gold with a ton of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass and a lumpy grey tinted white head that fades quick and leaves some scraps of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is mostly grits with a whiff of alcohol. The taste isn't bad, sweet corn, green apple skin and a touch of grain alcohol. Medium bodied and easy to drink. Tastes more like a lighter malt liquor than a typical ""ice"" beer. Not bad for what it is, cheap and high octane."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,3.55,"This beer looks like a macro lager. Its smell is faint. It lacks scary funk; this is nothing like OE; one might say it is clean smelling. I sort of like the fact that this beer, as its packaging suggests, is quite plain, in a midwestern-american kind of way. This beer should be served cold because it is meant to quench the kind of thirst that can't be quenched by hydration alone. Palate is mildly sweet with alcoholic headiness lurking just below the surface. There is nothing really off-putting about this beer. It is stronger than the typical swill and tastes fresh and unsurprising. I like it and I hope it stays on the shelf around here."
Worst,Clear Creek Ice,2.56,"Bold goldenrod beneath three fingers of sheep's wool colored foam that is of acceptable quality. Not that most loyal drinkers will care, since this stuff probably goes straight from can to mouth. A few blips of soapy lace won't last long.

I hesitated when assigning the style since American macro lager could have been chosen as well. Strictly following the ABV guidelines, however, puts this Minhas Craft(?) Brewery lager into malt liquor territory. Good thing too, because it smells like one. It's lightly corn-like, with a hint of huskiness and a hint of ethanol. Thankfully, it's too underpowered to be overly offensive.

Clear Creek Ice tastes like watered-down malt liquor. That's a good thing for those who don't care for the taste of malt liquor... and not such a good thing for those who want a big alcohol bang for their buck.

Does the flavor really deserve a description? Oh all right: sweet corn, untoasted grain and a small splash of grain alcohol. It really isn't any more complicated than that. What were you hoping for, Belgian yeast? Conjure up a flavor memory of your favorite malt liquor. Now, subtract a little sweetness, a little flavor and a little alcohol. Street cred score: zero.

The mouthfeel is actually pretty decent if expectations are on the reasonable side. The sugars give it substance and a slightly slick finish, while the carbonation is right about where it should be.

Although the scores seem a little bit high in retrospect, Clear Creek Ice does what it was brewed to do and does it pretty well. Sure it's sledgehammer simple, but it's also better than any macro lager you'd care to name. Bottom line: training wheels malt liquor."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,1.24,"If this bottle has a genie, he's a greasy extrovert of a genie, probably wearing lots of bling and parachute pants.

Long ago, I helped a stranger who was struggling to unload some heavy items from her car. Afterward, she thanked me by handing me a can of Country Club, chilled in a cooler in her trunk. This is how an '80s gas station tastes. I haven't seen it again, but I recall it vividly, even now: wet dog, corn, and alcohol, with a modest armada of grit afloat. Astounding. It did have a nice sort of metallic can note, to be fair.

If I see it again, I'm gonna try it, just to remind myself of the benchmark. Nothing -- not Coors, not Keystone, nothing -- could be as quintessentially awful. The label is a perfect predictor of everything inside. If they stop making Country Club, there will still be plenty left unsold in the gas stations of 2237."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,5,"There’s nothing like a nice classy Country Club 40oz in the morning, before work, during work, after work, and after a nice classy 40oz of Country Club. Heck I’m country clubbed up right now if I do say so myself, the relaxing crips taste, the smooth feel down my throat, the nice refreshing smell, and that beautiful gold and white logo is enough for me to responsibly enjoy at least five Country Clubs a day. 5/5 good beer."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.49,"I remember this one from ""back in the day,"" and found it, a rare find around here, at a backwoods convenience store. I just had to try it again. Malt liquors were first marketed to white men back in the 1960's, believe it or not, and my Grandpa Bennett would always crack open an 8-oz. Country Club or two after work. My mom reportedly gave him holy hell when he was caught giving me a few sips as an 18-month old. I guess that he was just checking to see if the Irish parts of my body, i.e., those that are involved in processing alcohol intake, were working properly. And thus my ghetto taste in beers, apparently. Anyway, I was not too impressed, overall. It was flat and corny-tasting, with a weird, psuedo-metallic aftertaste. As I bought cans, I can't blame any skunking for the less than par experience. Still, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, the six I bought could have been sitting in the cooler for years. Wouldn't try it again, though."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.24,"40oz clear glass bottle with a branded screw-top. No ABV listed on the label. ""America's premium malt liquor.""

Pours a clear pale copper body with a good 3 fingers worth of off-white foam sitting atop.

Aroma yields pale malt and cheap corn, lending this some sweetness but seemingly not too much.

Taste is of pale malt and a bit of cheap corn adjunct, which isn't bad when coupled with the smooth, wet, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. I always fear budget malt liquors will be syrupy and sticky, but this avoids that.

Drinkable albeit forgettable inoffensive fare. I doubt I'll ever try it again unless I'm after a cheap buzz. More insipid than anything else.

D (2.18) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
""Lucked"" into another clear 40oz bottle of this. Pricetag reads $3.00 (USD). The white and gold label design looks like something out of the Reagan era.

Pours three fingers/7-8ish cm worth of off-white foam. Frothy and billowing. I can't knock it, and the retention is pretty nice at 6+ minutes. Body is a clear thin watery dark urine colour. No visible yeast or sediment; it's obviously filtered.

Aroma brings notes of creamed corn and inoffensive pilsner malt along with a cheap grassy hop character. Diacetyl and DMS are indicated, and it seems too sweet. More of a grainy aroma would be nice. Average aromatic intensity.

Taste is creamed corn, DMS off-flavour, and pilsner malts with some cheap syrupy sweetness dragging it down. Too sweet, though not egregiously so, and I've had more syrupy more thick malt liquors. Obviously, it's unrefreshing, but its creamy softness on the palate warrants commendation. Smooth and wet, and not as overcarbonated as many budget malt liquors.

Overall, it's an inoffensive brew that drinks best at colder temperatures and will satisfy casual drinkers after a cheap buzz. I liked it better this time around than when I initially had it; I imagine these clear bottles sitting around in seedy Brooklyn bodegas are at high risk for being lightstruck. Not a terrible beer, but I can't recommend it even at this budget tier (see Ballantine XXX for a more worthwhile choice for budget drinkers).

High D (2.24) / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.53,"When you drop that beer in the return slot the next day. That's the appearance. Sweet, corn aroma, nod bad for what it is.

Woof, this gives the big fusel alcohol feels. Not even that strong, but it amps it up on your breath. Its some high bitterness low hops, high alcohol, corn malt bill type of malt liquor, but without the punch, even though its mouthfeel kinda makes you think maybe otherwise."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.06,"I am a gross fat monster and so I've been looking for Country Club for years.

I read somewhere once that it was the first high-ish ABV beer that was directly marketed a malt liquor, and I've come across more than a few old print ads showing fifties-era frat boys pouring this stuff out of what look like pudding cans while coeds stumble in the background. It would be another decade plus until ads came along that were brazen enough to directly implicate malt liquor with date rape (thanks, Billy Dee Williams!), but we still got Country Club to thank for that trend. Needless to say, this beer has long been on my must-try list.

Forties were just sitting at the bottom of the cooler in some gas station in the middle of upstate New York. I jokingly told the clerk that I thought they stopped making it in the 70s. He said they might have, considering how poorly they sold at this particular location, so that didn't bode too well for its freshness.

Untwisting the cap, however, I pick up only a faint whiff of skunk, which is actually kinda complimentary in a weird way (some green bottle Euro saisons milk this effect quite well). The skunk is almost exclusively aromatic, however, as the flavor is neigh indistinguishable from MIckey's. Trust me, I've drank a lot of MIckey's, and this is just a skunked Mickey's.

Which isn't bad, in my book, even if it's not exactly good. I wouldn't drink Mickey's so goddamn often if I truly disliked its flavor. It's not for beer geeks, yeah. But as a malt liquor served in 40s, it gets the job done and is absolutely inoffensive."
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,3.23,"I had been seeking this out for a long time. I found it at a liquor store in Waltham, MA one summer day in 2012. It was found in the customary 40 ounce bottle, just sitting there with a gaggle of other 40's; as if to scream out ""take me home."" I bought it and took it to where I was staying. I cracked open the bottle to find wafts of skunk, but these skunky scents did not deter me from enjoying this malt. The taste was something else, like a classic malt liquor should taste: sweet malts and a hint of adjunct.

I was able to consume the 'Club. Overall I'd have this again. Since that day however, I have been unable to find it; s though the beer gods seem to have said ""only once."""

S: corn syrup and sweetish pale malt, dull hint of green grass and/or old desiccated citrus peel... overall intensity moderate; no overt booze

T: relatively richly malty, long malty finish, subtle orange/champagne hard candy note on the very back... before second sip, bit of toasted grain (barley and corn), toasted caramel lingering, with the latter's subtle butterfinger-y character... marginal perception of (peppery) bitterness likely alcohol-derived

Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,3,"Second can picked up from the cheapo bin at Kroger. Best-by date on the bottom says December 21st, 2015.

Poured into a standard pint glass; very pale yellow while pouring, a tad darker in the glass. It's very clear, with lots of bubbles rising up constantly. Actually has a decent-looking head of foam on it at first, and though it shrinks away somewhat quickly it does leave behind a ring around the edge of the glass and some ""islands"" of thin foam on top.

Smell upon first cracking open the can was a pretty strong blast of corn and funkiness, though it wasn't nearly as flat-out *bad* as the smell from the first can, which I remember being by far the grossest smell I'd ever gotten from a beer (it was much more sulfurous than what I got this time, I'd almost describe it as ""farty"") -- I wonder why there was such a difference? Either way, the smell fades once it's in the glass for a bit, but taking a sniff gets you some corn and a bit of some not-so-pleasant sweetness. Fortunately, that weird sweetness does fade away after a while so you mostly smell just a bit of corn. It's not the worst smelling beer I've had, but definitely not all that great either, and I have to count the initial nasty smelling blast upon opening the can against it even if it is a bit more pleasant afterward.

Taste is actually a good bit nicer than the smell. It's pretty pleasant overall, actually -- certainly not what I expected going by what I've heard about malt liquor in general. The primary flavor is sweet corn, and there's also a bready, grainy malt kind of thing going on in there. There's also a bit of a not-so-pleasant sweetness which reminds me of the similar flavor I picked up in Busch Signature (just a bit more than in this one) and Foster's Ale (so strong it was overpowering and, when I got to the second half of that giant can, a drain-pour.) That kinda-gross sweetness seems to come out more if you drink bigger gulps, but even then it's still not quite strong enough to make the overall flavor outright *bad.* On a positive note, that weird sweetness (much like the smell) seems to be ""tamed"" more and more toward the bottom of the glass, Maybe this actually benefits somewhat from being allowed to warm a bit, contrary to all I've heard about lighter-colored cheap beers being best when ice cold.

Mouthfeel is actually pretty nice -- I was pleasantly surprised by this aspect of the beer. It's not super fizzy and prickly, but it's not at all watery or thin-feeling at all, it actually feels somewhat substantial which makes it easier to drink smaller amounts at a time to prevent the nasty sweetness from building up too much. Leaves an interesting slick/sticky sort of feel on the lips and tongue after drinking a bit, haven't had many beers that did that but I kinda like it. No complaints here.

Overall -- is this a great beer? Nah, not really. But considering the horror stories I've heard about how bad malt liquor is in general, I was honestly pretty surprised by this one -- it may not be anything super amazing, but it's definitely not anything super awful either. I've actually found it pretty pleasant to drink both times I've had it, the only real negative is the smell and even that's not so bad after the initial blast upon opening the can. If you can't afford the prices of most ""craft"" six-packs but still want something that tastes halfway-decent and feels like more than just light fizzy beer-water, this really wouldn't be all that bad of a choice -- I'd certainly take it over something like Bud Light, especially considering that this is 2 dollars cheaper for a six-pack!"
Worst,Country Club Malt Liquor,2.46,"Wow, a blast from my teenage years in Florida. I bought this on the wrong side of the tracks at a gas station in southern Virginia. When I cracked this quart bottle the first thing I noticed was the skunky aroma. the flavor was traditional ghetto malt liquor. which I grew up on. with that said, the brew was ok, but lacked carbonation to match the flavor. not completely horrible; but you get what you expected with this beer. A cheap buzz with little complexity."

F - Lightly carbonated and very light body. A step above La Croix. Refreshing.

First and foremost this Tastes good However, It lacks in the Beer department for me. I gave the looks highest marks because the Green 24oz Can was very attractive. At the store, I thought it was cheap enough to give it a try. for $2.88 what does it hurt to try something new? I didn't bother pouring it. Iv seen it in clear bottles so yeah, what is there to expect? Moving on to smell. Aroma is tropical. Bright airy refreshing. Lime hits you with that tangy Freshness and the addition of the Prickly pear adds a tropical Grapefruit/ Guava note. Now for flavor the very first note I get is american Lager Malt that last only a second, it then turns strait to tropical Island Flavor. Very bright and refreshing, easy going and light. Lime comes through along with a backbone of the prickly pear. Reminds me of Guava. Tangy fruity flavor throat the beverage with the finish being more like beer. Feel is lost. too watery for what it is. I wish it had more bite. seltzer-ish on the pallet, no carbonation burn to me. Overall, This is a fairly good tasting Beverage. It might be Beer but lacks some good beer qualities. I give it high marks on most every category based from what the Beer is on its own. A light Lager with added flavor. Great entry into Beer for people that dont want to taste real beer."

O: The beer is a little cidery and the sorghum earthiness comes across as a little musty especially in the aftertaste."
Worst,Blonde Ale,2.4,"WTF? A bottled beer from woodychandler? This is a rarity. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head and lots of carbonation. Smell is of sorghum, green apples. Taste is strong of sorghum, cough medicine, green apples, yucky yuck! Feels light in the mouth and overall thank God I am not gluten free."
Worst,Blonde Ale,2.27,"12oz bottle - ok, back to the sorghum and brown rice extract method of removing gluten from the beer equation - gulp.

This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy off-white head, which leaves a few minor instances of sea plume 'lace' around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight.

It smells like apple or white wine vinegar mixed with rubbing alcohol, with a heady dose of free-range berry sugar tossed right in, and an acrid vegetal graininess (my old nemesis, sorghum, right back out of Cletus' back 40 again, it would seem). The taste is sweet, musty, and kind of thin apple cider, more unpleasantly vegetal maltiness, some stricken earthy yeast, cheap dark sugar notes, and a hollow attempt at weedy and floral hop bitterness.

The carbonation is fairly light in its incessant and pandering fizziness, the body on the wan side of the barest middleweight, and not really all that smooth, as the tart and pithy fruity nature doesn't lean that way. It finishes off-dry, that stale apple cider thing still a real going concern, while the other goings on are of no concern.

Yup, the divide between the two processes for arriving at gluten-free (or reduced, I get it) beer ever widens. I can't really tell apart all the alternative grain offerings, especially from this brewery, as they are all pretty much a variation on what I've detailed here. Oh, and I just noticed that New Planet is from freaking Boulder, Colorado! How have they not yet been run out of town, or at the very least, um, better educated?"
Worst,Blonde Ale,1.08,"there's nothing wrong with the look of this beer but that's where the positives end. there's only six listed ingredients so i don't know what makes it taste so bad. i've tried all three of the ''omission'' beers which are gluten free just like this one, and the omissions are good so it can't be the gluten free factor that makes this one so bad. it's overwhelmingly citrus at first and the aftertaste is just horrid. luckily i bought this in a mixer-sixer so i didn't have to stomach more than one."
Worst,Blonde Ale,2.48,"I had a colleague who is gluten-free and I told her that I would keep my eye out for G-F beer options and report back to her on my findings. In the interim, I retired from that job and I still have the beers awaiting review. I have not felt perfect these last couple of days, so I thought that I would try something(s) fairly innocuous.

From the bottle: ""Refreshingly Smooth""; ""Gluten Free""; ""Ale Made From Sorghum and Corn Extract""; ""For every New Plane beer you enjoy, a portion of the proceeds is donated to help our planet.""

Geez, Louise, no sooner had I begun to Pop! the cap than I got a bunch of foam coming up through the neck! I placed the bottle in the awaiting glass and waited for it to calm down before proceeding. Can you say, ""Gentle pour"", boys and girls? It acted like soda pop, creating three-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that burbled, popped and fizzled its way out of existence. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had an apple vinegar-like sharpness and I have noted this before in other G-F beers. Mouthfeel was thin, kind of watery. The taste had a tart apple-like flavor, which, while not great, was drinkable. Finish was semi-dry with an apple-like flavor that seemed to linger. I am not sure how I feel about this one as I have other tests to conduct. It was reasonable, especially when you consider the narrow bandwidth of the gluten-free style."
Worst,Blonde Ale,2.34,"Poured a light gold color with an airy looking, white head, no residual lacing. Smell some hops, citrus, and some bread, very cider like. Taste and feels much like a cider with a carbonated, light feel. Taste is light and not much too it. Definitely tastes like rubbing alcohol smells.."
Worst,Blonde Ale,1.15,"As a long time celiac sufferer, I've kept up a long search for a decent (""good"" GF beer is like a white rhino) GF beer. New Planet would be out of business if there were many good options. This ""ale "" is as undrinkable as the rest of the beers produced by New Planet. I'll drink anything tolerable as there aren't many options, but this stuff tastes like you sucked on a dirty penny and then provides an aftertaste that lingers on your palate and makes the experience even worse. Their other beers are horrible as well, but this is the worst of the worst. Do not waste your money or time with this brewery. I'd rate it a ""0"" overall if it was an option"
Worst,Blonde Ale,1,Wish I could give this a lower score. Awful. 2 drinks and dumped it. Bought a single with a mixed 6 pack. Trying to find a good wheat beer I like so I tried this one. As a previous review said intolerable. Tastes like horrible champagne with corn.
Worst,Blonde Ale,1.1,Beer looks like a typical adjunct lager. Smell is of rubbing alcohol. Tastes like rubbing alcohol. Drain poured after just a few drinks. Intolerable.
Worst,Molson Ice,3,"This is the perfect beer of Hockey season! You want a cold beer for fall after Oktoberfest is over and you are short on cash but need to get blasted, this is your Canadian Knight in shinning armor. 5.7% ABV and a 6 pack, made by Coors now, so it has that rocky mountain Golden Colorado water flavor, good malt, and freeze method to make it smooth. The drink-ability of this beer is superb for college kids, but the snobs after they get married and become hobbyists will turn their noses up to this. I happen to like this beer and will give it a 3/5. This beer is not trying to be best in show, this beer is trying to be that college buddy that wants your hockey team to win, tell a funny joke and check in on you when you are in need."
Worst,Molson Ice,3.77,"Quite a nice AAL. Bought a double deuce for beer butt chicken; poured about 6 oz into a can for cooking and the rest into a wheat ale glass. Clear, golden and with a fizzy head that didn't last long. Big corny and grain aromas. Nice smooth flavor, more corn, grain, white bread, a just a bit of a floral hop finish. Much better than expected. Although, as a lifelong Michigander it should not have taken until today for me to try it."
Worst,Molson Ice,4.2,"(24 oz can, code NOV2519... poured into 28 oz mug)

L: crystal-clear, pale gold liquid; tall swell of tight, white, moussy foam on the pour, billowy, rocky crest above glass rim - looks fantastic, pre sips... the foam retention and contour is top-shelf - - what a beaut!... cap keeps, crust collects

S: cookie-like, biscuity malt scent, bit of cakey sugars on the tips... with subsequent refills, the intensity of the grain aromas drops sharply, leaving only a faint fragrant spiciness

T: dry, pear/apple fruit note up front; mellow, dinner roll malt aftertaste... little residual bitterness, but a subtle metallic twang lingers (am I dehydrated??)... second sips and beyond extend an almost pale bock malty goodness, but with a dull, dry swipe of any underlying complexity (too bad)

F: sort of a medium-plus bodied flow, sporting a long, warm finish... dry, but fulfilling, also leaving a soft, gummy smear on the palate... well tailored to those who enjoy some dainty junk

O: everyone needs a 28 oz mug to hold their malt likkers when stylin' en-casa... the striking green bottles became a brief mainstay in my home fridge back in high school after a sloppy incident when the proverbial alcoholic cat was let out of the bag - and I must admit I wasn't the culprit of the shameful event, though I did manage to finagle a bottle once or twice as a result... if one dabbles and/or dallies in the realm of AALs, this is a high mark, a treat - - but it's really more related to the malt liquor, and a crackin' example at that - an eminently repeatable indulgence... haven't had this in a damn long time, but I'm goin' back tomorrow fo mo (1410)"
Worst,Molson Ice,2.5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Thin white head, pale straw color. Aroma of sweet grain. Mouthfeel is light and frothy. Flavor is too heavy on the sweetness, somewhat cloying with little to no hop balance. Overall: I occasionally enjoy an Ice beer, but I will not be trying this one again."
Worst,Molson Ice,2.75,"Drank a fair amount of it when we lived in Michigan about 18 years ago. Wasn't the greatest beer, I have it at just below average at 2.75. The beer store down the street always had great deals on 12 packs of this, so at a good price, it was worth drinking."
Worst,Molson Ice,5,A smooth and easy drinking ice beer. Molson Ice hits the mark. Very refreshing on a hot summer day. One of the best ice beers. Put it in the freezer and drink ice cold. Cheers.
Worst,Molson Ice,2.95,"This beer is solid for the summer heat. Color is basic straw of macro beer. Aroma is actually fairly weak, I was expecting more. However, the taste is interesting. First thing on the palate is mixed berries. Then a little sourdough bread. Slight alcohol taste follows which i don't mind in these styles of beer.
Finishes really crisp and icy with some malt. I would certainly choose this if I was looking for a great Ice beer to drink while being outside in some humid weather. Definitely more of a flavor punch than most macro ice beers and slightly less carbonated which i love. Give this beer a grade of B-"
Worst,Molson Ice,3.49,"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 8/20/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/metallic aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Mildly increasing warmth of alcohol through the glass. Overall this is a pretty good pale adjunct lager style. All around nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery. Other than the slightly off aromas, this was really tasty. Very clean barley/grain flavors and solid earthy hop balance. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Pretty close to the regular, but more flavorful and fuller mouthfeel as expected."
Worst,Molson Ice,2.46,"This beer was $1.06 for a 24 oz can. That’s cheaper than water. It’s more flavorful than Bud Light. Not interesting, but decent for the price and smooth."
Worst,Molson Ice,3.37,"Pours a clear golden color with a three finger off white head that recedes to about one finger in size, lots of carbonation.
Some fruity esters, light hay, biscuity malt sweetness, nothing off.
Caramel, and alot of sweet malt followed by a semi dry finish and a touch of grassy hops.
Mouthfeel is creamy for an adjunct lager, I like it.
Overall for an adjunct lager, this blows me away."
Worst,Molson Ice,2.62,"This beer is decent for the ice style. Flavor is pretty balanced...Drink it nice and cold. Smell is average. This is one I drink when my funds are low along with IceHouse at $7.99 a 12 pack. and 6.9%. Overall it's easy drinking, cheap and strong wich is why I purcahsed it."
Worst,Bard's Gold,3.35,"Date: 2/16/21; I am not seeking a gluten-free beer. However, having a family member who cannot drink beer because of gluten; having produced sorghum from sugar cane in a previous job; and knowing that sorghum has a smell and viscosity similar to canned malt from previous brews, this beer piqued my interest. When pouring from the can, I was surprised by the light color since sorghum has a dark amber hue. I was disappointed with the head, which quickly disappeared (apparently a trait of malt-free beverages). I began to think I was drinking a Bud-light. I was wrong. The smell had a hint of sorghum, nothing powerful since there was no head to capture it. The taste was subtle, but having a palate for IPA's, this is what I expected. First sip to last, I enjoyed this beer. The second can was as good as the first. I imagine I would enjoy it more on a warm summer day after cutting the lawn."
Worst,Bard's Gold,5,"Tonight I had my first Bard's Gold and I am pleasantly surprised. My first thought is this is exactly what Michelob Light or Bud Light should taste like and if I remember, both beers used to taste better, but now taste like water especially Bud Light. It had a nice bold taste, good flavor, and sits well with my dinner. This is a new beer at my liquor store and I'll be buying it again."
Worst,Bard's Gold,1.56,"DATE: March 28, 2020.... OCCASION: two weeks into the COVID-19 quarantine, still (mostly) gluten-free, I measure a beer shared by my Coors Light-loving friend Billy... GLASSWARE: 22oz. pilsner... pours a tawny, sallow, champagne-tinged body with active effervescence... its head does the usual malt-free disappearing act, though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air... really not appealing in this light... immediate sorghum, hard fruits like apple, banana and pear, candied sugars, cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency... nothing really alluring here, unless you dig cider or sorghum... its first sip is dry, thin, nearly lifeless (watery) and without fanfare... a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions, but it doesn't muster much beyond a thin rinse... I turn to Billy, and his reaction suggest Coors Light has not been approximated... the flavor is constantly ebbing, with faint hints of berry, apple, sorghum, cheerio, and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture, elusively if not frustratingly so... its singular profile doesn't leave much else to say, so I end with a simple disclaimer: if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form, there's no need to dance with this one.... if you are a Celiac sufferer, maybe these will grow on you... all the same, cider might be a better option..."
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.55,"The smell reminds me of a gluten beer I had many years ago, but really can't put my finger on it - an amber ale or an english, or Epic Pale Ale? The mouthfeel and actual taste are not very beer-like overall. Candy syrup, possibly molasses, but not much flavour. The telltale sorghum astringency is there which slowly builds up as I drink. You'd probably get used to this overall if you drank it a lot.

For a sorghum beer, the sorghum is pretty well masked. Drinking multiple beers in a single session is the real test, but not sure I'll be up for the challenge. This is probably preferable to cider, but overall feels like a weird soft drink. As I live in Australia, I had to buy a whole box to get my hands on this. Hmm."
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.01,"Well as other reviewers have stated, it just doesn’t taste like beer. How do you make beer without wheat, barley, rye or oats? Obviously, you can’t, if this is the only answer. Not my cup of tea... or beer."
Worst,Bard's Gold,4.42,"I recently tasted Bard's Gold, a lager. I'm an avid beer drinker and have been trying to reduce the amount of gluten in my diet so I did a taste test of all the gluten-free beers on the market. Bards was the best of the lot. It is important to note that many of the competitors in the ""gluten free"" space are not truly gluten-free...they have ""warning labels"" that say they have been brewed to remove gluten...after a bit of research it appears that these beers use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein so the gluten can't be found in a test...but the gluten parts are still in the beer. I don't fully understand the science, but if there are parts of gluten present, it seems like misrepresented marketing to me??? Bards is made with malted sorghum (which doesn't contain gluten) and not wheat or barley (which contain gluten) like many beers. Looks like AB has a gluten-free sorghum beer too but it is made with a syrup and not the malted grain...we all know how important malting is to the beer's taste!

My body feels so much healthier as I eliminate and reduce the gluten in my diet and am glad that I found Bards. I'm looking forward to drinking more Bards in the near future!"
Worst,Bard's Gold,4.06,"Bard's Gold | Bard's Tale Beer Company. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer has a two finger thick head, with spotty lacing, and a goldish/copper body.

Smells like hearty grains, actually.

It has a decent lager flavor, but I can tell something is missing.

The mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation.

Overall, I'll rate Bard's Gold | Bard's Tale Beer Company with a solid 4."
Worst,Bard's Gold,1.48,"This beer has a funky taste to it, It's bland and what flavor is there isn't very enjoyable. There's better gluten-free beers out there than this stuff."
Worst,Bard's Gold,4.08,"Bard's Gold brewed by Bard's Tale Beer Company, with an ABV of 4.60% This brew brew pours out a nice brown color with a small white head. The head to this brew is small, and goes away fast. I really like the color of this brew . The smell of Bard's Gold, is rich with sweetness. You pick up on roasted grians and malts. There is also a hit of hops in the smell of this brew. The smell of this brew is really inviting. Now for the taste, it is nice with flavors and sweetness. There are mild notes of grins and malts. I really like how smooth this brew goes down. Now , Bard's Gold , has a real nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I like how this brew ends with the sweetness. This is a fine drinking brew. The mouthfeel of Bard's Gold is rich, clean, smooth and refreshing. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. Overall I'm going Bard's Gold a 4 out of 5. I thought this brew would be a bit more bolder, however it is a nice drinking brew. I would buy this brew again. Bard's Tale Beer Company, did a nice job with this one."
Worst,Bard's Gold,3.38,"Looks alright, kinda cloudy, and a deep golden color.
Smells of apple, peach, and some leafy hops.
Taste is one dimensional, hops, some malt, kindof like a pilsner.
Mouthfeel is light and crisp, like a lager.
Overall, not sure what they were going for, but this beer would fit in better with a german pilsner category than adjunct lager."
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.15,"I quit smoking a few years ago and apparently that staves off celiac disease. Harsh irony!

Anyway I have cut any and all kinds of precious wheat creations like, say, bread, but not beer, god no. Thought I'd try an experiment to see what happened with a GF beer.

If this is all I get: fail. I picture that guy in the Matrix, wanting to think that daily mush is a steak. Well, it ain't; no blue pill proffered.

Specifics:

No head or gone to nada before I noticed. Smells beery, in a lager kind of way. Looks like a lager. But tastes like something new, however not, importantly, beer. Almost cider I suppose, but I like cider. Not cider either. Sorghum ""beer"" is its own thing.

There is an aftertaste, which I guess is the sorghum. Or rather, It's like an after-sweetness, and also this slippery after-mouthfeel--like you went to the wrong sushi bar and maybe it's time to get worried.

If my stomach gets so fouled and this is all I can handle? Switching to wine and booze. Thanks for trying though Bard's, hopefully you perfect it. Try some more! Run a kickstarter, I'll kick in."
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.79,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark golden color with hardly any head at all. Smell is sweet, apples. Taste is ugh. Sorghum, apples, vinegar, not very appealing or refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and overall, I have had worse beers, but I don't need to ever drink this one again."
Worst,Bard's Gold,3.02,"Sampled last night on 7/16/15. From the Bard's Tale Beer Company in Utica, New York. Wasn't this brewed in Minnesota at one time? Comes in a 12 ounce bottle and is ""Gluten-Free"". Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a glass-handled stein.

Brew pours a golden-honey in color with a thin white head. Actually some 'ring-like' lacing was seen when sipped that surprised me since the head was so small. Aroma is of some grains with a light hint of sorghum. Pretty much is said for the taste. Slightly dry and sweet finish. Has a different taste but wasn't that bad. Lighter-bodied with good carbonation."
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.79,"i know a lot of the gluten free beer out there right now isnt gluten free at all, and thats not good for those who are seriously sick, not just those following the trend, so its nice to have this on the market as an alternative that actually is gluten free. the problem is, it just doesnt taste much like beer, and i dont think sorghum drinks really ever can. it looks really pale and fizzy, like carbonated apple juice, and has a sort of similar aroma, sweet and fruity, but this is not a good stand in for malted barley, and the difference is immediately evident. there doesnt appear to be much hops in here either, as it finishes long and sweet as well. its not bad, i mean, but it isnt beer. i am (obviously) not in the group that cant drink beer yet (fingers crossed i never am), so its hard to say how this stacks up to others like a red bridge or a glutenator from epic made with sweet potatoes, but i know that its not close enough to beer to be passable. its not a bad drink, not by any means, and i think it belongs in the market, but its also not really a beer... i dont know"
Worst,Bard's Gold,2.5,"Bottle from Harvest Market to fill the mix a six I was putting together.
Fairly clear light golden head with a tightly bubbled small white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of sour apple and light sugar. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is sweet with a bit of a tart fruit thing going on with bit of pomme fruit and light sugar. Light, crisp, bubbly. Not really what I would call beer, but it didn't really suck either."

taste:  typical light lager with hints of cereal as well as light malts and a touch of hops. Mild but lingering aftertaste more clearly reveals the hops.

Worst,Antarctica Pilsen,2.23,"12 oz can poured into pint glass. Appearance is pale gold and clear with cascading bubbles. No head to speak of. Nose is pretty awful, notes of sour grain, lemon, corn, and metal. Taste isn't quite as bad as nose implied as there is more bready malt character to cut through some of the off notes. Some sweet fruit juice like notes that seem quite out of place come through at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. This is not a good beer, even for and already sub par style."

Worst,Antarctica Pilsen,2.07,"Pale Yellow color. Strange enough this Adjunct Lager produced lots of thick head with low to medium retention and leaving traces through the glass.
Faint aroma of non-malted cereals but some floral hops identifiable.
Taste of cereals with a bit refreshing and spicy feeling.
Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness. Light body and good carbonation.
I remembered why I could not stand Brahma and was on the Antarctica side of the split population of Brazil, for its bitterness. Nevertheless all the formulas seem to be pretty much the same now, and it carries some annoying corn note."
Worst,Antarctica Pilsen,2.13,"Sitting poolside in Rio....

Pours clear golden with a 2 finger white head. Lots of carbonation rising.

Aroma is of adjuncts....corn.

Taste of corn, quite light...adjuncts

Mouthfeel is light bodied and slightly cleansing.

Overall, really no need for another one. If a beer can't taste good while sitting poolside in Rio....then it is not good!"
Worst,Antarctica Pilsen,1.71,"Straight pour from 473ml can to a 5oz-ish tumbler. That comes out to 16oz, right? Freshness date of November 13, 2012 printed in black ink in the kick-up underneath the can (at least, that’s how I’m interpreting it: “131112”).

Appearance (2.5): Very small, short-lived head on this, snow-white and starting around half a centimeter thick. No fingers to measure this one—this beer is fingerless. Some lacing, actually. The body is a pale yellow, and clear. Well, at least there’s some sudsy lace.

Smell (1.5): Kind of smells like the water cup at a beer pong table: vaguely beer-like, but mostly water. Some very plain barley scent that might be most accurately measured in parts per million. Some sweet corn? I suppose the lowest score would be if it legitimately smelled bad, but this just doesn’t smell like anything to speak of.

Taste (1.5): Following the nose, this is more of a palate cleanser than anything else. It’s got a strange aftertaste though, like unflavored grits mixed with some overcooked vegetables. There is just the GHOST of a hint of bitterness in the finish, vaguely herbal and vegetal. I’d love to say that it has a distinct pilsner yeast note, but it simply doesn’t.

Mouthfeel (2.0): Well, there is some carbonation. It’s low-key, fizzy, and dies quickly, though. What this beer DOES have going for it is quenching-ness. It’s very light, goes down easy, and I suppose it has a somewhat dry finish, for lack of sweetness or viscosity.

Overall (2.0): Can I give this a 1.75? This is definitely not a good beer, and not a good representation of the style, either. To be perfectly honest, with this little taste, body, and feel, I’m shocked that it even retains 5% ABV. That said, the beer was meant to be light, inoffensive, and drank in large quantities, all of which it achieves without much trouble. It’s not the worst of the worst—that would be a slushy of Classic Ice, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, and Rogue Chipotle—but it does not stand out in any way, whatsoever, and is forgettable at best. Don’t get me wrong, I can dig a good AAL once in a while. But even in terms of the Brazilian market, with which I consider myself relatively familiar, this is far from anything notable."
Worst,Antarctica Pilsen,2.45,"A: The beer is crystal clear light yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a thin white head that quickly died down leaving lacing on the surface and a thick ring around the edge of the glass.
S: Light aromas of adjunct malts, particularly corn, are present in the nose.
T: The taste is very similar to the smell and the flavors are quite mild.
M: It feels light-bodied and a bit thin and watery on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is very easy to drink; the smell and taste are not that offensive but then again there’s nothing really special about either of them that would make me want to try another glass of these."
Worst,Minhas Light,2.6,"Poured from a can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head. The head fades super fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell –The aroma of the brew is mostly of a corn smell mixed with a little bit of a musty aroma.

Taste-The taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a grain. As the taste moves on some lighter flavors of caramel and even more corn come to the tongue. In the end one is left with a somewhat more sweet corn cereal taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thin and light with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thin body is prime for the sweeter and subdued tastes of the brew. A little higher carbonation would have been slightly better for the lightness of the brew, but even so, the feel was alright overall.

Overall – For a 4% abv. brew that clocks in at only ~95 calories I am not going to expect a flavor powerhouse. Nothing is really off in the taste, but nothing is really on either. It is sort a standard light brew overall."
Worst,Minhas Light,2.85,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some light hints of corn, but is odorless for the most part. Taste has more flavor than I expected. Corn, grains, some malts, a bit of green apples. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer. Considering the brewery and the beer style, mediocre is pretty good in this case."
Worst,Minhas Light,3.23,Well....better than bud light and quite honestly if u drink light beer this is a good alternative to the big brand guys it has better flavor and ur paying 9.50$ for 24 beers
Worst,Minhas Light,2.92,"Appearance - Light yellow. Very clear and very bubbly. Short and very short-lived sudsy white head.

Smell - Light and very sweet pale malts. Corn and candy.

Taste - Sweet and corny, but obviously quite light. Light pale malts with no apparent hops character. Slight metallic tang and a little bit of a cloying aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - Light and crisp.

Overall - Pretty inoffensive and refreshing. Judging by some of Minhas' other efforts, this could be much worse. As is, it's a decent low priced stand in for the more flavorful of the macrolager lights."
Worst,Minhas Light,1.9,"Bought a case a few weeks ago. It was cheap and I didn't really want to spend too much on beer at the time. 10 dollars for a 30 pack, will do.

Not even going to pour this into a glass, it's not worth it.

Smell: Very fruity. That's about all I get. Fruitiness and maybe the slightest bit of a used up hop smell.

Taste: Well, it's light alright. Water, fruit, corn, and a ghosting of stale hops. Can't really expect too much from this.

Mouthfeel: Decently carbonated and very thin. Watery the whole way through. It goes down very easy to say the least.

Overall, it's not vomitrocious. It's not good either. I can't say I will be picking this one up again."
Worst,Minhas Light,1.66,"So it was $2.29 for a 6 pack. Decided to take a shot with the goading of my co-worker.

Pours super pale yellow, huge head that actually leaves a bit of lacing on the plastic hotel cup (I'm classy fuck you).

Smell is um..not pleasant. something offputting about it. Not beery at all.

Taste is, well I've had worse, tastes like a macro light, no worse than Bud light and a crap load cheaper.

Mouthfeel is water, strike that, it's carbonated water. Kinda like H2OH, if you've ever had that.

Drinkability. I've already 4 in, and have one more to finish, along with 2 more New Glarus, the fact that I can still type after 10 beers in the last hour says to me that it is pretty sessionable. Not that it tastes good, but at this point I'm really not getting the full flavor, and it hasn't made me puke yet, so bottoms up.

In short, cheap beer, not objectionable if you are just looking to get hammered in the cheapest way possible and you have something against malt liquor. But if you want beer, then don't buy this."
Worst,Minhas Light,1.73,"Bought a case of this (24pack) for 5 bucks... hard to beat that!

A- Pale yellow, a bit of fizzy head that immediately reduces to nothing.

S- Doesn't smell like much.. Maybe a bit of hops mixed with lots of water..

T- Tastes just like it smells... like water and bit of sweetness coming from something. The good news is it doesn't leave too much of an aftertaste.

M- The mouthfeel? Put water in your mouth and see for yourself.

D- This beer is pretty sessionable for me. While I dont think the taste is great, the lack of a bad aftertaste is a plus for me, and I have no problem throwing 10-15 of these back in a night. I can't say the same about some other macro brews.

If you are looking for the cheapest reasonable beer possible to get drunk, I'd recommend Minhas. It definitely isn't any worse than your typical Macro brews, but about a third of the price. If you are looking for good beer, avoid at all costs."
Worst,Minhas Light,1.69,"The CANQuest (TM) rolls on, thanks to my having gotten the hang of resizing photos for submission. I have a bunch of CANs that I was holding in abeyance until I could get a picture uploaded since they look better unopened, IMHO. This was one of them. CAN you dig it?

From the CAN: ""Brewing beer in Monroe, Wisconsin comes naturally. Since 1846, our brewmasters have handcrafted premium beer from only the finest natural ingredients - a proud tradition that continues to this day.""; ""Calories 97, Carbohydrates 3.6g, Protein 0.73g, Fat 0g"". I include these stats because although the CANs look very similar, this is NOT Minhas 75.

The Crack & Glug produced two fingers' worth of fizzy bone-white head that burbled and popped its way out of existence. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with the barest hint of a chill haze. Bear in mind that when I type ""pale"", we are talking REALLY light in this case. Nose had that now-familiar Minhas grape bubble gum odor that seems to be a product of whatever poor yeast strain they have overworked to the point of near death. Mouthfeel was thin, not quite watery, and with a taste like drying tobacco in the mouth. It was almost passable if you like that sort of sweetish smell and taste. Finish reminded me of my youth when we used to chew tobacco, especially Red Man. I gave that stuff up a long time ago and CANnot recommend either it or this to others. Minhas!"
Worst,Minhas Light,1.33,"Pale straw with a dirty white head that actually lasts a minute or so before shrinking to a thin film. The nose is green apple, creamed corn and something else vegetal that is not pleasant. Yeah..Minhas light is not good. Metallic and cooked veggies with a touch of corn syrup. Light and fizzy bodied. You really can't do much worse at any price. Avoid."
Worst,Tecate Original,2.38,Clear light copper color with a small white head. Smell was of something dank and no malt and hops Light body with a watery mouthfeel and a strange tin-like bitterness.
Worst,Tecate Original,2.56,"Had a draft served in 24 oz mug. Hazy, cloudy look that left light lacing. Citrusy aroma and taste was slightly juicy, not sweet. Easy drinking, but didn't really resonate with my taste buds. Won't be ordering again."
Worst,Tecate Original,3.2,"Poured from a 32oz bottle best by November 2022.

On the pour a fizzy one finger head forms then dissipates relatively quickly leaving a ring around the glass amd some light bubbles floating on top. It looks quite light, with a not quite yellow light straw colored body and streams of lively carbonation. Brilliantly clear.

Aroma is largely corny malt, with a hit of slightly skunked hops on the back end. The hops are actually detectable which for the style is nice. Slightly funky from the skunk but it sort of brings the mexican beer vibe and some hop aroma is still intact.

Flavor follows the aroma with a bit of a mineral hard water taste on the front that quickly morphs into a corny malty lightly bitter but smooth ""beer flavor"". Quite crisp despite the hint of skunk and the malts are quite prominent with a corny but not syrupy sweetness that leaves you feeling refreshed but like you're drinking real beer.

Feel is a bit light and watery with a decent carbonation bite before the head builds up and gives a bit of texture. Doesn't feel very big but that makes it quite refreshing. I just wish it was a little less watery, but the strong malt flavor makes up for it.

Overall one of my favorite Mexican lagers solely for the flavor. Cheap beer either gets the feel right or the flavor right and this one almost nailed the flavor, unlike most American beers which go only for a good feel. This one is a bit light but actually tastes quite nice."
Worst,Tecate Original,3.25,"Drunk during my trip to Silao (Guanajuato, México). Normal mexican bottle.

Appearance: Pours a clear, pale golden color with a moderate lacy white head.

Aroma: Minimal aromas of cracker malts. Faint.

Flavor: Mild flavors of cracker and pale malts. A balanced finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation.

Overall: A crisp Mexican Lager. Mild on aroma, flavor, and body. Crisp and clean."
Worst,Tecate Original,2.53,"Purchased as a 32oz bottle from Citgo for $2.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear gold, with a quick-to-dissipate two-finger pale white head.
S - Light grains, corn. A little herbal. Oyster crackers.
T - Exactly same as the nose. Better than you'd expect.
F - Light-medium in body, with plenty of carbonation. Filling, but still super drinkable. Refreshing.
O - Honestly, a fairly average Mexican lager - but my favorite (tied with Modelo Negra). Not bad at all, but an objectively bad brew. I'd definitely get this one again, but paired with tacos from a truck. Worth a try."
Worst,Tecate Original,3.52,"Appearance: Pours a clear, pale golden color with a moderate lacy white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Minimal aromas of cracker malts. Faint. (3.50)

Flavor: Mild flavors of cracker and pale malts. A balanced finish. (3.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. (3.50)

Compared to Modelo 1/18/22: Pours a more pale color. Milder aromas and flavors. Less honey, bread, and Mexican spice. Winner: Modelo

Overall: A crisp Mexican Lager. Mild on aroma, flavor, and body. Not terrible adjunct flavors though. It probably would drink similar to a Corona. Crisp and clean. (Final Rating: 3.52)"

Corny, syrupy, slight floral hops.

Overall:
I am shocked that I have never reviewed Tecate. I have had both it and the light version many times. Overall, It is not terrible, but not great either."
Worst,Tecate Original,3.24,"Look: Clear golden in color with a fizzy and noisy head that billows up and quickly recedes to a lid, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Barley malt, bread, light floral hop notes, and cereal grains
Taste: Cereal grains and barley malt kick it off and quickly followed by some nice but light floral notes that filter in and blend well. Kind of watery in the middle before grains resurface and close it out
Mouthfeel: Light and a decent body but definitely on the ‘watery’ spectrum, medium-high carbonation, very clean and crisp throughout and on the finish
Overall: I dig it. For a cheap but not “corny” or skunked Mexican lager, I’ve always liked this one and it’s fun to revisit it each year but also a nice test to see if my feelings or palate has changed. It hasn’t – this is still quaffable, refreshing, and not off-putting or cheap tasting, which makes it a winner for me"
Worst,Tecate Original,3.31,"I bought a can at the LCBO in Ontario 473ml at 4.5%.

Sweet corn and a little apple
Smooth and light makes it easy to drink.
Overall an ok beer from Mexico.
Cheers."
Worst,Tecate Original,3.03,"Tecate is crystal clear, and the color of ripe hay, much like any mainstream lager. The head is cloudy, bone white, and shows decent retention.

At first blush, Tecate smells of white bread and soda crackers. From there, the aroma thins out somewhat, initially leaning more towards the aroma of soda cracker. In the middle, the nose becomes more neutral, lacking the roundness you might find in European pilsners. The finish offers hints of leafiness and fresh cut grass, indicating use of European hops, at least.

On the tongue, Tecate starts out smooth, and light in body. Malt profile makes itself known in the form of soda crackers, and yesterday's biscuits. In the center there's just a hint of green apple tartness, although still none of the rounded quality of a European pilsner. The finish is European enough, giving me hop flavors in the form of peppercorns and dried leafiness.

It's not a world class lager by any means. But it is crisp, light in body, and completely refreshing. And that is in large part what you pay a lager to be on a hot, summer day."
Worst,Tecate Original,2.44,"The contents of two 12 ounce cans were combined until a clear glass Imperial pint mug was filled. The beer is a bright and very lightly colored amber, almost as clear as seltzer water. A slight head occurred during the pour, but there's very little within a minute or so. It's almost odorless, unlike some American Adjuncts which at least throw a little malty sweetness or a little yeast toward the nose. There is far more glass lacing than there is taste. But, it's not all bad. Somehow the malt that doesn't show in the taste, creates a pleasantly bodied brew. This isn't malty to taste, so it is in good balance with the very mild dose of hops. Perhaps, under the right circumstances, this might pass as an acceptable session beer."
Worst,Tecate Original,5,Absolutely enjoyed this beer a lot. Pours a nice golden beer color. Nice foamy head that goes away rather quickly . But seriously smooth/ malty/sweet corn taste. Amazing on a nice hot day outside. It goes down super easy and doesn’t make you feel bloated. Don’t know why this is rated so poorly.
Worst,Tecate Original,1.51,"L: Pours straw yellow with a two-finger white head.
S: Smells like corn, glass bottle, & some hay barn funkiness.
T: Taste follows the nose, it does have some okay grainy flavors, but there is just something funky about it.
F: Light-bodied, high carbonation, thin, crushable.
O: I know a lot of people like this beer for weekend benders & cookouts, but it just isn't for my taste."
Worst,Tecate Original,2.64,"The beer is pale straw, clear, and has a short lived head. On the nose, it smells mostly of corn. Taste-wise, it is sweet and corny but not cloying. It is crisp with a bit of earthiness. The moutfeel loose but with good carbonation. Overall, a good beer for the style."
Worst,Carling Black Label,3.21,This is good for an AAL. It tastes of corn adjunct and water but it goes down smooth. It's refreshing and cheap. When I feel like drinking in session it goes perfect in between Hamm's or Banquet. I wish I could get a straight answer on what the ABV is.
Worst,Carling Black Label,4.3,"A hot post grass cutting day. I drank it out of the can. Perfect, the second one was even better. Look: perfect,because the can looks cool. Smell: seriously!? Taste: in the pabst realm, not watery, not too sweet, what, you were expecting the usual corn bread toasted malt b.s.? Feel: like a cold 12 oz can. Overall: on my way to the garage fridge for a 3rd."

s: Mildly sweet light malt and adjunct.

t: Bright clean biscuit malt with some slightly sweet notes.

What more could you ask for? If you have never tried it ...you should so and you will like it..just wish I could I find it bottles though."
Worst,Carling Black Label,5,"Sweet and refreshing... Probably the only beer in the world that holds its taste at room temperature.. It's very citrusy to my taste buds like five alive.

Idk why maybe because I find cheese disgusting and absolutely horrible, just the smell of cheese alone is enough to make me vomit.

I do try different beers from time to time and I always endup going back for black label

Worst,Carling Black Label,3.6,"12 FL. OZ. can
Served in a vintage Busch Bavarian Beer goblet

This beer pours a brilliant pale yellow and is topped with a fleeting white head that leaves spotty lacing.

The aroma is grain with a little floral and grassy hops.

The taste follows the smell. It starts out with light grain flavor. it is balanced nicely by a touch of grassy hops flavor. The finish is a little dry and clean.

Light bodied with a slick, smooth mouthfeel

This is a surprisingly good lager as far as macros go. It has a little more body and a slightly dry mouthfeel making for an enjoyable drinking experience. Stroh's, move over. You need to make room for some Black Label in the fridge."
Worst,Carling Black Label,3.88,"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 11/11/2019. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.

Aromas of lemon, cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of corn, wood, pale malt/grains, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength, Taste of lemon, cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of corn, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness.

Great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent hop flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager! All around great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, and great noble hop presence/balance for the style. Mild on adjuncts. A really enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best AAL I have had for sure."
Worst,Carling Black Label,3.33,"Happy CANada Day, hosers! Take off, eh? This is one of my FAVORITE holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink CANned CANadian beer ISO The CANQuest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies, like ""Slapshot""; c) watch ""Strange Brew""; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a CANdian flag. 2017 was their 150th Anniversary so I pulled out all of the stops, using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements, which was attention-getting, to say the least. The local CANstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away, but I was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns, especially to my sensitive bits! Needless to say, I have scaled back since then.

A BIG ""THANK YOU!"" to my local, in-person trading partner, @tone77 , for providing me with a buncha beers for today's CANebration! He said that many of them will take me back to the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs were the standard & the norm. No matter! Today, we CANebrate & inebriate! Cheers to our CANuck neighbors!

This beer really takes me back. It was ~ 1969 & my late-Pops was a hardcore unionist working at the now-defunct ALCOA plant. A strike was in the offing & so a meeting was held at my parents' house to decide a course of action. My 'rents, while not teetotalers, were not big imbibers so alcohol consumption was kind of a rarity. I was ~ 4 y/o at the time & curious, so when somebody offered me a sip from their CAN of Carling Black Label, Pops nodded in assent & I partook for the first time in my life. I CAN only remember being astounded by the bitterness of the hops just before I dropped the CAN from my hands, spilling it all over the carpet. Uproarious laughter ensued, except from Pops, who promptly escorted me to bed. LOL.

I had ""O CANada"" playing on YouTube as I Crack!ed open the vent to begin this momentous CANebration.

This reminds me of another story. I was a Plankowner aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) in 1989 & when we opened the Staten Island Naval Shipyard in late-1990, I was a fixture at Rangers games @MSG. It was easy - flash my active duty ID, pay a pittance & sit in the infamous Blue Seats where the action happened. Beer was a given & if I got there early enough to where they were not sold out, a potato knish. Profanity was the native tongue up there & cocaine was openly snorted, but those are tales for another time. On this night, the TOR Maple Leafs were in town, necessitating the singing of both the U.S. & CANadian national anthems. I know the latter in both English et Français so I was singing along when I suddenly registered the voices behind me. Right tune, wrong words, or so I thought. After the anthems were done & we were seated, I donned my Curious Cat suit & turned to ask the guys behind me as to what had transpired. They were Spanish-speaking Latinos of Puerto RiCAN descent who had grown up in Hell's Kitchen & were lifelong Rangers fans. They had been to so many games that they sing the national anthems in SPANISH! I sat back, flabbergasted.

Onward! I went with a nice, free-flowing Glug since this was such an auspicious ocCANsion, leading to the foamy formation of two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky-bone-(Great) white (North) head, but with only moderate retention. 8=( Color was a pretty Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with CANadian-quality clarity & now The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus appeared to join the CANadian CANebration! Whotta party. Nose was actually not bad, when rating to style.

The adjunct that mars most, if not all, AALs is the inclusion of corn. I have loved Fritos corn chips since Kindergarten when I first had them as a snack, but I do NOT like the taste of corn in beer. It is an extender that traces its roots to illicit beer being made during Prohibition when anything & everything was fair game as far as ingredients were CANcerned.

Yes, there was a corn aspect to the nose, but I have encountered FAR worse with some like opening a bag of the aforementioned Fritos! 8=p This was on the low end of that f**ked-up spectrum. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more innocuous than anything else. It was light in flavor to the point that adjuncts were more of an afterthought than something with which to be CANcerned. I was kind of surprised at just how flavorless this seemed to me to be. My palate, as a self-avowed, self-described hophead, seemed to have evolved to the point that AALs are rendered simply ethereal. Not bad, just not destined for Guy Fieri's ""Flavortown"". Finish was crisp, dry & refreshing on this hot, hazy, humid CANada Day, which is just what they were shooting for. Sure, it's a flawed beer, but the style itself is flawed. Remember, Rate to Style & NOT to Taste, boys & girls!"
Worst,Carling Black Label,3.23,"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a very pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, light sweetness. Taste is of malts, corn, light sweetness. Feels light bodied in the mouth and overall it ain't bad at this price point, and would probably be very refreshing most of the time, but it's a brutally cold February night in Ontario."
Worst,Carling Black Label,2.02,"A fairly popular lager in my youth although at that time Red Cap ale was more popular (on tap) in London Ontario. I had this beer years ago after living in Germany for several months we travelled to England on a holiday and popped into a local for a pint. I noticed that they had Carling on tap and asked the barkeep if it similar to the Canadian Carling Black Label , he said that it was the same but brewed in Britain. I had a pint and was amazed that it had a continental flavour and tasted not at all like the Canadian Black Label, it was better.
But this is the Canadian brewed Black Label and this is a pretty basic macro American/Canadian adjunct lager. It looks, smells and tastes like a macro American/Canadian adjunct lager similar to all the other Canadian Macro lagers I may drink it on tap if it is the only thing there on tap but I won't be buying it in bottles or cans again! It is a cheap beer but I'd rather spend another 20 to 25 cents per can for a better European lager."
Worst,Carling Black Label,2,"I had this beer years agi and never again. It had such a bad flavor. It literally tasted like the can. I finished only one beer but barely. I have a rule I can't dump a beer but I almost with this beer. The only thing I can say is that if you can find this beer, I don't think it is distributed in the USA anymore, it is usually dirt cheap. Run away from this beer."
Worst,Carling Black Label,1.21,"This 'fine' beer tastes like aluminum. Even when in a glass bottle. So, if a soft, malleable yet determined, metallic taste is what you are after .... And, the price is oh-so-right. So, go ahead and fill the trunk. The mother-in-law is coming over for the weekend."
Worst,Carling Black Label,4.18,"Carling Black Label is an old Canadian standard.

For many years it featured commercials with the line: Hey Mabel! Black Label.

473ml can. 4.7% alc. No mention of ingredients or IBUs.

Poured into a glass. Thick white head. Lots of bubbles. Light golden colour.

Smell: Faint hops, grains, malted barley, white bread. All very subtle.

Taste: Grains, malted barley, white bread, hops. Like the smell, all very faint.

The beer is light bodied and the mouthfeel is crisp, dry and refreshing.

This beer is not unlike Pabst, Coors Banquet, or other American/Canadian-style Lager beers.

For the style it's very well done. It would be great on hot days, at barbecues, picnics."

Feel: Goes down really easy. Light to medium body. Medium to heavy carbonation.

So overall would I recommend it? Sure, nice budget beet."
Worst,Mickey's,3.53,"Pours a brilliant gold colour with a nice head that evaporated almost instantly. Smells cheap and syrupy. The taste is ok, Way better than I was expecting. I get sweet notes and corny notes, it seems thick and viscous. Dry mouthfeel

Worst,Mickey's,3.32,The king of this category for me. The old pull-tab big-mouths flew down the throat throughout high school and college. Stung by the bee way too many times and don't regret a thing.
Worst,Mickey's,1.84,"Just got back from my local beer emporium with a 6-pack of this classic college-boy swill. Still in the green glass ""hand grenade"" bottles I remember from the 70's. I poured a bottle into a pint-size German lager glass I've got which is one of my favorites to use in looking at, smelling, and tasting beers as it has a wide mouth. The beer starts off fairly well: nice amber color with a decent amount of foam and a floral smell. About half-way through the glass though I notice a creeping metallic taste, faint at first then becoming more pronounced toward the bottom. Also present is a kind of disagreeable syrupy sweet mouth, (the corn syrup adjunct perhaps?) with a faint overtone of skunkiness.

Overall, not a beer I would particularly recommend to anyone I like. Back in the Old Days was often consumed with copious amounts of the ""Devil's Lettuce"" so that might have affected my taste and memory of the brew. I'll try it again in a day or two and see if my opinion changes. As malt liquor beers go, probably as good or better than most."
Worst,Mickey's,3.68,"Crystal clear yellow-gold, ample carbonation, but my pour started out too gentle and even though I poured the last 2/3 quite vigorously, it still only garnered a short white head that disappeared in a minute or so. Some lacing as I tip the glass. I thought about just chugging it from the wide-mouth bottle for more authenticity, but instead I used the closest glassware I have to what I remember from the dive bars in the 60s - a sham pilsner glass.

Aroma is not bad at all. Kind of nice, actually, if not too strong. Bready and grainy with hints of fruit.

The initial swig starts with an impression of a taste that is, well, interesting. The grain from the aroma is more prominent in the initial sip. The middle picks up some sweet corn flavors, perhaps honey, with the finish and aftertaste being bread doughy with a mellow, doughy, aftertaste. If there is any bitterness there, I almost have to imagine it. IOW, it is quite mild. While my initial impression of the taste was ""interesting"" (Minnesota-speak for a ""nice"" way of avoiding stating an opinion), the flavor did grow on me, even by the finish of that initial sip, and it continues to does grow on me the more I drink. I actually am enjoying this, and could see pounding a few in a summer afternoon on the deck.

Mouth feel is medium to thin bodied, more substantial than most AALs.

Overall, as I stated, I quite enjoyed it. The only format I could find was the six pack of 12 ounce bottles, and I won't have any problem wanting to finish the rest."
Worst,Mickey's,2.9,"Purchased a 6 pack of hand grenades at a neighborhood liquor store for too much money ($8.99)
On the pour it's beautiful fine 1 finger head, effervescent bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass for at least 10 minutes now, standard lager color nothing wierd. Even forms pretty good lacing as I drink.

Smell on the other hand is malt liquor, not appealing almost tart, but not as bad as old english kinda just smells like old beer and yeast maybe a little metallic.

Taste brings some redemption from the smell, not necessarily smooth but theres almost a hint of banana flavor but there is a little bit of that tart off note from the smell but not nearly as intense. Then it fades into a grainy almost grape nut cereal taste that leaves you feeling warmer than most mass produced ""lagers"" out there. Still very sweet and corny though.

Feel is a bit heavy to be a drinking and working beer but good for relaxing if you're not feeling like spending much money but want a little more flavor.

Overall cheap and flavorful, not all the flavors and smells are good cause it's cheap but it's better than a lot of these malt liquors out there."
Worst,Mickey's,3.9,"Crystal clear, light gold body; excellent, fine carbonation; thick and creamy head, white and sticky. Decent aroma; cereal grains; lightly sweet. Light grain taste; light corn; light hop bitterness; clean. Medium body; nice residual sugar mouthfeel, soft; delicate warmth permeates the beer.

I'm not sure why there is a lot of dislike for this beer. It's at the low-end, ABV_wise, of being a malt liquor, yet it comes across balanced and relatively complex for an adjunct lager.

Poured at 45 F; MAR1422"
Worst,Mickey's,2.14,"The Legendary Mickey's Malt Liquor. My first go round with this beverage. Didn't want to use a glass because I love the big mouth bottle, but I decided to pour it for the sake of a review.

Semi-aggressive pour has the malt liquor foam up out of the glass a bit.

Settles to a 2 finger pure white head on top of a nice looking gold body.

Can't quite put my finger on what the smell is, but it's not good.

Taste is sweet, corn, finishing with a bit of a metallic twang.

Feel...not much.

Overall...I kinda hate it...but I also love it for what it is.

Cheers!"
Worst,Mickey's,2.18,"Purchased as a 40 for $2.18 at a local drive-thru. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear deep straw with a two-finger soapy white head that dissipates quickly.
S - Corn flakes, corn sugar, and a little bit of skunk.
T - Sweet. Not really any balance, but a lot of corn and light hay. Ethanol burn towards the end of the 40.
F - Lighter body, medium carbonation. Very smooth. Filling.
O - Arguably the second-best 40. I've had this before, but this is really the only time I've ever sat down to review it. A quick and relaxing way to get a nice buzz without the typical ""gasoline"" vibe of other 40s. Would buy again if the brand wasn't getting the axe."
Worst,Mickey's,2.6,"Smells like adjuncts and sweet corn syrup. The taste follows the nose and it goes down easily and clean. Overall, is probably the best malt liquor you can buy."
Worst,Mickey's,3.81,in the context of being a malt liquor. This is a great beverage. Compared to the more cheaper harsher brands of this category. Color is good the beer is smooth does not have any offensive after taste.
Worst,Mickey's,3.02,"24oz can, date code OCT2521. Poured into an Arcoroc nonic pint glass.

A - Poured a clear yellow with large foamy white head on initial pour that recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing on the glass.

S - smells primarily of malts with a slight funk; adjuncts somewhat noticeable.

T - Malt and sweet grains comprise the majority of the flavor profile. Finish is clean and mildly sweet.

M - Medium-bodied, medium carbonation. Drinkability is decent.

O - Not bad for the style. Might come back to it if I don't want a HGML. Tick complete."
Worst,Mickey's,3,"Green glass 40ozer (dated with a best by of Aug 02 2021) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a clean, clear, bright honey gold color with 2/3 inch of white head that dissipated quickly, and left no lacing.

There were no hops in the aroma, some lightly funky malts, and a touch of apple. The apple disappeared on the tongue, but there wasn't a bunch of other flavors either. Fairly neutral.

The body was, as expected, light and crisp, with a sweet finish. Drinkability will depend on your appreciation of the style; if you like the style, you'll do OK with this one. Overall, not bad for what it is. Tick completed."
Worst,Mickey's,4.38,Reviewed to style. Pours a translucent gold with a fluffy white head. Smells like adjuncts and sweet corn syrup. The taste follows the nose and mostly tastes like any macro light lager. It goes down easily and overall is probably the best malt liquor you can buy.
Worst,Mickey's,2.66,"Pours golden yellow with a 1 inch white head. Moderate lacing, which lasts.

Aroma is slightly skunky, hay, grass, bread, slight floral.

Taste is malty, corn, sweetish. Light bitterness.

Light bodied, a bit watery. Moderate carbonation. Semi-sweet finish.

For what it is, it's fairly decent."
Worst,Mickey's,3.59,40 oz glass bottle that was in the freezer for 20-25 minutes. Tasted great. Refreshing! Classic malt liquor. Miss the old wide mouth 40's. Gotta drink' em cold for the best experience!!!
Worst,Mickey's,2.78,"Look: Clear gold with a lot of rising carbonation bubbles. Huge two-finger white head with average retention.

Smell: Yeasty, slightly skunky corn adjunct malt.

Taste: Generically sweet corn malt and nothing else.

Mouthfeel: Completely average with good carbonation.

Overall: One of the most boring drinks on the market."
Worst,Extra Dry,2.17,"Tooheys Extra Dry, or TEDs as they're colloquially known in Australia, is a well known mass produced adjunct lager, that had its heyday in the early to mid 2000s. Originally brewed at 5%, it's alcohol content has decreased significantly to 4.4%. Once a popular beer amongst teenagers and young adults looking for a quick easy buzz it was marketed as an easy drinking lager, and gained notoriety with music festivals and outdoor events. Nowadays, it's less popular, and Tooheys are attempting to revive it, by playing on it's declining popularity with a marketing campaign of being 'proudly ordinary'.

Look: Standard Aussie mass produced adjunct lager look to it. Golden hue, medium size head, soap sudsy looking which disappated quickly to a white bubbling slick. It's an Aussie lager, it looks pretty standard.

Smell: Classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Grainy, faint fruity hop aroma. Bready yeast, a little chemically, almost like a citrus air freshener. A little bit of egg white.

Taste: Sweet maltiness, slight fruitiness. Not overly bitter. light graininess . The dryness lingers in the palate, and tastes a bit chemically. Quite bland even for an Aussie adjunct lager.

Feel: Light, refreshing when ice-cold, highly carbonated. Tastes like a beer that you're going to knock back several of without really caring about what you're drinking. You're drinking it for the buzz it will eventually give you if you knock back enough of them.

Overall: I like many Australians drank a fair bit of this back in the day when we were young, dumb and thinking we were cool. I remember many a headache afterwards, and associated nasty hangovers with this stuff. I must say, it certainly isn't as good as it once was, and the fact that Tooheys are advertising it as 'proudly ordinary' is really all that needs to be said about TEDs. It's an ordinary beer. Nothing fancy, it's not trying to be stylish. It's there to serve a purpose, and not to be savoured. Although I don't know how much longer than can keep marketing this when they keep knocking down the ABV. It's going to be mid-strength the way it's going before too long, following in the footsteps of the Carlton Cold."
Worst,Extra Dry,2.94,"Its crisp, dry finish is achieved by an extended fermentation, ensuring minimal residual fermentable sugars. Wonderful fruity, malty notes accompany a mellow middle palate, leaving a clean aftertaste."
Worst,Extra Dry,2.78,"Format: a clear 345mL bottle with a transluscent label. Looks okay.

Appearance: pours an amber-golden colour with bubbling carbonation. A thin half-finger of head drops to a thin film and ring. Limited lacing.

Aroma: pretty typical lager, with light hops and light cereal adjunct grains. Okay.

Taste: pretty much follows the nose. This comes across as being a beer that is designed to be put away quickly without thinking about it too much.

Aftertaste: light cereal grains here again, without much bitterness.

Mouth feel: light in feel with medium to higher carbonation. Clean and crisp.

Overall: an okay macro lager, but there are better even at this price range at AU$40 a case."
Worst,Extra Dry,1.67,"whoa, new depths. somehow this brew reminds me in smell and taste of burnt fireworks. Cant exactly pin it down except to say that's what comes to mind. To go much further is pointless. Now here's where the requirements to write more are redundant. Nobody wants to read it, there's nothing more that adds to the story, hopefully this doesn't aggrandize the narrative."
Worst,Extra Dry,4.61,"does me great, me and the girls always smash a few of these down. it gets us all pissed as nits till we don't know what happening any more. one doewnside is it always makes me really horny, but it provides me the perfect side bottle for me too (if you know what i mean ;) )
i love it"
Worst,Extra Dry,3.5,"A: Flashy golden filtered texture, half a finger of white head, little carbonation. Beautiful to look at.

S: Malts, sort of an acrid scent much like animal offal. Surprisingly not much skunk for the clear bottle. Film developers fluid.

T: Malty, somewhat standard AA Lager like, little floral, not much skunk, a nice yeast in the aftertaste.

M: Light body, medium carbonation.

O: Beautiful beer I was not expecting much from. Not really getting any skunk to my delight. Taste like an average smooth AA Lager, with nothing to really complain about regarding it. Could match any number of foods."
Worst,Molson XXX,2.85,This was not awful! Alcohols was well hidden despite cheap ingredients. Mostly inoffensive nose of malt and corn. Flavors similar with some bready notes similar to Molson Golden. I would have another of these for sure in a pinch.
Worst,Molson XXX,2.79,"Got a 12 oz bottle of this for free recently. Poured into one of my pint glasses, this pours a very clear, medium golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles continuously and rapidly rising to the surface. Has a nice white head that's an inch thick when first poured that settles to a very thick surface coating and a very thick ring lining the inside of the glass and decent lacing. Head settles eventually to a nice film layer of surface foam and there is some pretty good lacing in the inside of the glass too after a few sips. Aromas of some bready malt sweetness along w/ what's likely corn and rice and not much else. Not the best aroma by any means, but not unpleasant or offensive either. The taste is pretty much the same, some bready, malt sweetness followed by rice and corn and just a slight hint of hop bitterness. As I get a few more sips into this and as this starts to warm up a bit, I'm starting to taste an unpleasant grassy, cardboard, metallic bitter like off flavor of some sort. Also a touch of hops. Has a crisp and also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel w/ moderate carbonation. That unpleasant grassy, metallic bitterness taste lingers on my palate after each sip. I'm not even going to finish this one.

Eric"
Worst,Molson XXX,2.82,24 oz can pours golden with a light white head and lots of small bubbles. A light malt with ad little hops on the nose. Mouthfeel is light with just a little bubble foam on the palate. The flavors are decent with a bit of malt and a generic hops. You don’t get the 7.3% bite you might expect. Has a sweet rather than dry finish. A decent North American adjunct beer. Try it if you like simple adjuncts.
Worst,Molson XXX,1.88,"From a can, poured into a frozen mug. Some malty bread corn smell. Clear gold with 3 finger head. There’s a slight sweetness to it and mostly malt. Not great but not horrible. Is it worth it because of the 7.3% ABV? No. If that’s your destination, you’re better off getting a good bottle of scotch or bourbon."
Worst,Molson XXX,5,"I read some of the reviews which are ridiculous??? Paragraphes about notes of, and hints of ??? Are you kidding me??? If your trying this beer and you're a beer snob then don't rate it! I tried this brew on my lunch hour at work with a sandwich and some veggies and it was great! Better than a Bud Lite and satisfying for a quick lunch brew during work break. I'm not a beer snob but usually drink good beer, Founder's Short's Sierra Nevada but for a cheap, satisfying brew on launch break, this beer is great! Notes and hints escape me. This is why wine snobs get bilked out of millions because they think they ""know"" wine tasting. Drink beer to enjoy, not to ""examine"". BTW, my great grandfather was a brew master from the old country who drank and made good beer and passed it down to his family. I've said enough, enjoy this brew!!!"
Worst,Molson XXX,3.78,"This beer is a very good inexpensive choice it has a beautiful color and is a a little on the dry side with a maltiness to it, not hoppy. This beer needs to be drank very cold, the colder the better. The 7.3% AC is an added bonus to something drinkable and cheap. Great beer for hanging out with friends outdoors or fishing. This beer is not for snobs or others that need an excuse to drink beer."
Worst,Molson XXX,2.06,"This beer used to be ok when you had to go to Canada to obtain it.
I guess before the merger with Coor's.
Not it just tastes like cheap malt liquor. Corn and grass with the alcohol biting the back of your throat.
It tastes like the ""Ice"" beers hot there."
Worst,Molson XXX,2.76,"Another review from April 2017, screw top Molson. I don't even remember how I came across this.

Looks like we've been designated as a malt liquor. Ok, so I'm guessing they went with corn to bump this abv up to get placed in this category. Ok, never found Molson to be all super grain 100% barley feels anyways.

Pours the most common color appearance of anything under the rubric of beer, golden, good clarity, 1/3"" white head with poor retention. Aroma of well, malt liquor frankly, corn and rubbing alcohol.

Yeah, taste is largely fueled almost fusel like fueled with some sharp booziness. Big carbonation. Not much for taste here, a stinging booze, mild high alpha acids, mostly corn notes, you'd have to search for something resembling a grain malt bill. I'm not saying regular Molson is all that, but its better than this. Its like they just wanted to amp the abv up and took the cheapest way of doing it. I dunno, it looks decent, and the carbonation and body are light, but you really gotta drink this one super cold to avoid the alcohol bite and sting."
Worst,Molson XXX,2.23,"I expected a lot more from this one. A dark yellow pour with minimal head. Scent is a mix of malt, alcohol and some hop bitterness. Taste starts out bitter and mellows into a semi-sweet malt backend. There is something off in the taste I can't define. Mouthfeel is on the light side. An aftertaste that is unfortunately dominated by an unappetizing metallic taste"
Worst,Molson XXX,3.24,Stick to regular Molson. This xxx is very sweet and malty and not very good. It’s corny and sweet. Like you mixed BL Platinum and Miller High Life and added cheap vodka.
Worst,Molson XXX,2.25,"Bought a 24 oz can at a local party store in order to meet the debit minimum purchase. I figured I'd get something not necessarily compelling, but at least sweet and inoffensive. Well, I was wrong. From the can this one was boozy hot with sweet corn notes and a grassy, floral hop finish. After a few big gulps the booze heat lessens, but that mostly had to with the buzz the ABV was generating. There are other cheap, higher ABV brews worth the time."
Worst,Molson XXX,1.37,"I am by no means a beer snob. In fact, I truly enjoy discovering diamonds in the rough amongst even the cheapest most overlooked macros. Many of them are remarkably smooth and imminently drinkable. You can casually drink them without noticing or being unavoidably reminded that you have sacrificed a great deal of quality for a very low price. Molson XXX is a beer that you can't sip casually and forget what you are drinking. It's the kind of beer that will have you looking at the glass with a furled brow, puzzled and disgusted each time you take a sip as if you might somehow be able to tangibly see the reason for and cause of your displeasure.

24 oz. tall can purchased from a Kroger store in East Atlanta for around $1.40. Poured cold into Weizen glass. Decent frothy head that subsides rather quickly to leave behind a watery almost non-existant lacing with no noticeable bubble strands flowing upward after about 2 or 3 minutes. The look is quite flat and watery, and color is much darker than I was expecting. Almost a light rust colored hue. Certainly not a classic bright yellow golden straw color.

Smell is not too terrible, although slightly perfumey. Undertones of saturated wheat, yeast and stale grains. Otherwise smell is somewhat nondescript. Judging by the smell, I was expecting a sweeter tasting maltier beer than what it actually is.

Taste is immediately offputting. The alcohol taste is overpowering and readily apparent. If I didnt know better i might think this was spiked with rubbing alcohol to achieve the 8% mark boasted on the can. You immediately know you are drinking an 8% and the alcohol is not nicely tucked away and understated like it is in some other high gravity contemporaries. I dont think the bitterness in this brew is coming from hops, but something else entirely, and I would describe the taste more as a dark sour than a bitterness. But even sour is too nice of a word to describe the taste of this beer. Absolutely foul. Dirty metallic spicy copper immediately assaults the tongue, and the aftertaste is similarly wretched making this beer damn near undrinkable.

Mouthfeel and consistency are also poor. Watery, although there is some slight spicy carbonation that trickles down the throat. Noticeable alcohol afterburn going down, that makes it difficult to discern if the burn is from carbonation or just alcohol. Somehow syrupy thick and watery thin at the same time. Truly a paradox, but not one that has you looking up at the stars pondering the complexities of existence, more of disappointed perplexed feeling of how is this possible. And why? Just why. Consistency of saliva coupled with the detestably offputting flavor makes for a truly terrible combination.

Trying to finish a glass of this is a difficult and unenjoyable endeavor. I want to hang on and finish this to give it an honest evaluation from start to finish, but it gets more disgusting and unpalatable with every sip, even given the best possible treatment, perfectly poured in a chilled Weizen glass.

Much Like Icehouse Edge, this beer took a basic smooth and simple template and crammed as much alcohol into it as possible through obvious adjuncts, leading to a grossly imbalanced final product. I dont mind tastefully balanced adjunct lagers at all, in fact in may cases I actually prefer them. But in Molson XXX, it is too obvious that the adjuncts selected were chosen specifically to raise the alcohol content and nothing else. There was no attention paid to smoothness, flavor or drinkability and instead of raising the alcohol content in proportion to the body and flavor of the beer, the alcohol outpaces Molson XXX's meager frame in all respects, pushing any redeeming qualities this beer might have far into the background, vastly overshadowed by an imbalanced, disgusting alcohol taste.

Overall, I was very disappointed, even though my expectations werent high going in, for a cheap high gravity gas station malt liqour, but I have had many others in this category that outperform this in every way. I expected more from our Canadian northerly neighbors. Perhaps this beer is designed with the sole purpose of warming you up in sub zero Canadian temps with an affordable alcohol content, but there are far more efficient and enjoyable vehicles for achieving this objective, even at this rock bottom price point. I found this to be in perhaps the bottom 3 of any beer I have ever tried. Hurricane high gravity is the worst beer I have ever tried, and if given the choice only between these 2, I'm really not sure which I would rather suffer through.

A truly miserable brew that exaggerates and accentuates all the negative stereotypes of cheap malt liquor, and then some. This beer should be completely avoided unless you are already 7-8 in and are just looking for a cheap nightcap to finish you off . Perhaps then you may not notice just how awful it really is, but again there are much better options to achieve this objective at the same price or less."
Worst,Molson XXX,4.3,"Pours clear, pale golden with a two finger, white head. Aroma is corn syrup and light skunkiness. Taste is sweet corn syrup, moving to some minuscule hope presentation. Finish is all corn. If you love corn syrup, this is your beer. If not, there's not much reason to drink it."
Worst,Molson XXX,3.36,"I got this from a beer store in London, Ontario whilst there for my son's hockey tournament. It poured a clear golden with no head and no lace. The scent had grain presence. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with bread notes. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its a good beer."
Worst,Molson XXX,3.31,"24 Oz can poured into glass
Look - like any average beer, maybe a tad bit more amber color with some foam not much lacing
Smell - Not a whole lot there, smells like a malty bread beer. Mostly grainy not much bitterness or sweetness detected.
Taste - Sweet. Fairly sweet malt and do pick up some of the alcohol which is to be expected. It has a sour profile almost like sourdough bread, not totally unpleasant but not great either. Not too much bitterness although it settles in after a while. I would say an IPA is a mix of bitter vs. sweet but this is a balance of sour vs. sweet. I don't particularly love the style and so that plays a part in my rating, it just doesn't taste all that great or satisfying, although if your plan is to get buzzed then this is fine. Prickly carbonation but that is consistent with Molson.
Overall, just an okay beer and okay tasting, price ect. so i will give this beer a grade of C+"
Worst,Molson XXX,3.11,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A 2"" sudsy white head drops slowly with some mild lacing. Color is slightly hazy gold with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aroma of toasted malt, corn, floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with a lingering boozy finish. Flavors sweet corn, yeast rolls, and floral hops. Overall: it is a bit cloying and sweet, but that is not unusual for the style."
Worst,Molson XXX,3.68,"The clear deep golden yellow colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” white head that recedes slowly but visibly and leaves an ring of irregular patches of foam around the glass and a thin irregular island of foam on the surface. Eventually there are only a few patches of lacing on the sides. Sipping creates a couple of sheets of lacing that turn into small scattered patches of lacing that mostly recede to the surface of the liquid.

The aromas are mostly about the malt but there’s noticeable corn here as well. The hops are slightly grassy and in the background.

As expected from the nose, the flavors are mostly about the bready, crackery malt and corn sweetness. There’s also some grainy character from the corn and just a hint of grassy bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasant.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp with the finely bubbled, moderate and persistent carbonation. The medium length finish begins as the malty, grainy sweetness begins to fade to a slightly grassy, almost bitter and semi-dry ending.

Keeping style in mind, this is a reasonably tasty and drinkable malt liquor with a moderately high ABV and easy to drink. That said I’ll not be seeking out more in the future but only because I prefer a bit more hop flavor and bitterness from the hops."
Worst,Molson XXX,3.58,"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 6/18/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light honey, nutty, corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Lightly increasing warmth of 7.3% after the finish. Overall this is a good malt liquor. All around nice robustness of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and easy to drink for the ABV. Very clean and rich barley flavor profile, with decent earthy hop balance. Not overdone on corn/adjuncts at all. Pretty similar to Regular and Ice, with more barley flavor and body as expected. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example."
Worst,Kaliber,2.7,"(330 ml bottle, L1326GGOO4 FL; purchased single off shelf... poured into a 14 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, orange-tinged gold liquid; two-finger-high, tight, rocky foam stand... some lace; keeps a thin cap

S: a malt character I've yet to encounter, almsot has sweet potato pie crust (or ginger snap?) baked and spiced notes... it's not bready, nor biscuity

T: the flavor is not much different... yuck, awful... not beer like, and especially not like other NAs I've had... old wheat bread and apple cider?... quite dry with those apple crumb notes lingering

F: light-bodied, buoyant, without much drag and roundness, but with just enough texture to give mild fulfillment; carbonation is soft

O: smell and taste alone, this is arguably the worst NA on the market... don't know how fresh this bottle is: Nov '21?... can't they do better than this? I'll give em this, it's unique (1915)"
Worst,Kaliber,1.21,"First of all, I can not imagine how any of the other ratings found the good things they said. Especially the ones rating it as sweet. This garbage is sour and horrible. I believe it was spoiled it tasted so bad. I was afraid I was going to get sick. Happily I awoke not sick so hopefully that possible danger has passed.
It did have a sort of a weird smell that made me think I might be drinking something possibly sweet but once it hitmy tongue all that disappeared.
The only thing impressive about this is that it would make a decent beer to serve for the purposes of a movie that required a bubbly drink with a thick head. It bubbles with a thick gooey foam that just lingers in a frightful manner given the horrible taste. After smelling and tasting this swill I began to wonder if the foam was part of some spoilage feature. I read reviews from the top in complete disbelief until I ran into 2 in 2011 that captured the essence of what I would like to say HORRIBLE. Many NA better."
Worst,Kaliber,2.75,"it is ok, there is not much taste in this one. Tastes sweet. Does not really feel like beer. Kinda taste like apple juice to me for some reason. I do not dislike it. There must be a non-alcoholic one out there that is more beer like."
Worst,Kaliber,1.78,"Meh, it’s beer, I guess. I’ve really been exploring the Low Alcohol beers lately and some come up really short. It just doesn’t taste like beer, some other kind of malt beverage. I’d pass."
Worst,Kaliber,1.12,"I love Guinness but cannot finish this one. It tastes like peat straight from a bog mixed with construction glue. Pours clear,gold in color with one third inch head. Light bodied, medicinal, sweet, with moderate carbonation. This is just awful. A huge disappointment. I feel sorry for my drain where this will be going...soon."
Worst,Kaliber,2.34,"11.2oz bottle, given to me by my neighbor, Eric. Pours a deep golden hue with a thin beige head. Aroma is malted barley and some earthy hops - reminds me of how my grandfather's home brew wort from when I was a kid (weird memory). Flavors are more malted barley, lightly toasted grain, and earthy hops - but it's not good. Medium body, ample carbonation, sweeter grainy finish. This was just bad. Not worth it even if you are trying to avoid alcohol."
Worst,Kaliber,3.43,"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has an iced tea color with a 1/2 inch head and lots of carbonation. Smell is of malts, little else. Taste is of bready malts, somewhat dry. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall it's not bad considering the abv."
Worst,Kaliber,3.37,"Tried it a while back and actually like it ok for a low alcohol brew. I remember a floral kinda fruity smell, not what I expected from this type of beer. Had a dry kind bitter taste that was not unpleasant. Actually a very enjoyable brew considering the style."
Worst,Kaliber,4.2,"Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; code L8084GFOO1.
A: Pours a crystal clear, light amber color with a more than one inch, white head, low retention, and spotty lacing.
S: Initially, detected the sweet scent of rose and/or raspberry, replaced by strong breadiness, especially crust.
T: Very dry with bread (and maybe a little caramel) predominating over other flavors. Peppery/cumin bitterness is a nice counterpoise.
M: Light bodied with robust effervescence initially, limited to tiny remnant AAL bubbles relatively quickly. Solid mouthfeel, certainly not watery.
O: Kaliber is very drinkable and enjoyable. This is a low alcohol beer and should be rated comparatively. Not a terribly complex flavor palate, nor is it meant to be, but certainly more flavorful than most AALs. Top of the Line among the low alcohol beers."
Worst,Kaliber,3.87,"I like this beverage because I am feeling to drink a beer, not a down watered Guinness. Really nice color and strong malts. Very good mouthfeel. CHEERS!"
Worst,Kaliber,2.76,"I thought a Guinness malt beverage would taste like stout but I was wrong. Instead, the flavor reminds me of the mass-produced 24-packs of cheap lager/pilsner that are guzzled by frat boys to get drunk. I suspect that the beverage was made with adjuncts instead of barley so that might be why the flavor seems off. While its taste is mediocre, it actually has a nice mouthfeel and head. The beverage is okay but I prefer drinking non alcoholic beers that taste like craft beer."
Worst,Kaliber,4,"This is an N/A beer, and I feel needs to be rated as one. Therefore, personally, I like it a lot when compared to other NA beers, I feel like i am drinking a beer."
Worst,Kaliber,3.41,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass.

Pale amber body color, hints of red and pale orange with a very nice clarity. Minimal carbonation through the body with a creamy to fairly bright white two finger head. A bit of staying power, as it slowly settles to a thin puck and collar.

Aroma is slightly a mix of good and bad. Floury and pasty malts, hints of straight DME, and a faint touch of grass like quality. Light touch of caramel sweetness, but also a bit of a chalky quality.

Palate is a bit of a surprise. A pretty decent body on this, with touches of light malt sweetness that doesn't go overboard. Clean finish with a pretty simple malt character. There's a bit of carbonation almost mineral quality but the body is big enough to cut through it to not be distracting.

A pretty passable and easy drinking N/A brew. Quite a surprise actually."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.64,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Pale yellow, good head.

Smell: Mild malt, hint of sourness.

Taste: Mild sweetness, light corn flavor, very mild bitterness in the finish.

Overall: Grabbed an extra after softball for a review. Pretty decent light beer, some flavor and even a bit of bitterness. Easy drinking and inexpensive, I might have to grab it instead of Miller Lite on occasion."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,3.97,Old Mil has a beer I drank when I was in college because of the price when I was in college was 9 bucks a case and as I have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet. This beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away. can basically copy and paste this to the Old MIl premium but no point to go with premium due to no noticeable taste difference and just higher calories. EDIT REVIEW. this beer has replaced Busch Light as my go to beer combination of flavor and cost. There is a reason that this product has won so many award and is the most award winning light beer regardless of hipsters and fanboys wanting to trash it because it is a (Cheaper) beer. People need to realize that just because a beer costs more does not mean it is better.

Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. Overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Nice clean pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best macro light lagers I've had as expected of Pabst."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,4.88,I usually drink labatt light blue. Royal or Milwaukee's best light but old Milwaukee light was 50 cents cheaper than the best light. I tried it nice clean sweet taste. It didnt have foam overkill like best light overall a much better buy than bud light miller light or Coors light best bang for the buck
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,"Pretty sure I had this before Pabst acquired them was never a go to, but was cheap, easy to drink and readily available. It comes in at just below halfway between poor and average."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.42,"From notes taken 09/24/17:

Very pale and clear straw gold. Lemon-white cap of fine, uneven fluff, with surprisingly good retention. Nose is faint lemon, sweet not sour, pinch of yeast, some grass. Light grain palate, adjunct but not distractingly so. No honey suggestions, which is good. Overall, like mineral water with a few drops of lemon and melon juice. Pretty standard fare, refreshing enough, light in body, with tight spritzy carbonation."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.67,"An hour before my buddy's wedding in Bascom, OH this week, I decided more ""emergency"" beer was needed for possible late night. So I ran down the road to Tiffin to pick somehing up and this was what I ended up with. I was going to do the regular Old Mil but they only had thirty packs and that seemed excessive.

This is incredibly bland and flavorless but also overcarbonated and watery. Fine for easy pounding but not something worth looking out for."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.25,"This is the best tasting light beer I have had, I normally do not like light beer, I only drink it rate it. I would drink this again only if it were free."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,4.57,"Im embarrassed to say this, but this beer is actually a great tasting light beer. Who knew? It's got a clean taste with no tinny or weird aftertaste. I'm going to start buying this beer for the warmer months because i think it'll be a great lawn mowing beer. Don't be embarrassed like I've been, pick some of this up, it's actually better than most of the more expensive mass produced light beers. True Story!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,2.23,"Super light yellow aal light beer kinda thing going, solid white head, almost average retention. Aroma was just industrial beer smells, aluminum, corn.

Taste, super carbonated, light noble hop, almost no barley content. Super watery mouthfeel. Even though its really lightly hopped flavor wise, the lack of a malt body allows a distinct, soapy bitterness to jump around. High alpha acid hops and a super long boil = less hops to pay for."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,3.55,"Poured from a 12oz can into a Pilsner glass. L: pale straw yellow. Clear, decent effervescence. S: light white bread malts. Honey, apple juice. Aroma actually gets better as it warms. T: better cold. Off flavors present as it warms. Mineral and rice. F: crisp. Pretty dry and clean. Not too watery. O: good, better than the original."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Light,1.76,"Picked up a 15 case of these naughty puppies in cans. If Old Mil itself is any indication, these aren't going to be much better. Tossed it in the fridge, kudos to my staff discount, and proceeded to pound one back with some leftover Chinese take out. Taste is of air. Nothing. A hint of hops that teases you and then withdraws completely like a hooker who realizes you've only got spare change in the ashtray of your car. That's about it. No smell, nada. This is a working man's beer, without a doubt. I sell a ton of Old Mil each day and mostly to contractors or site workers. This stuff only sells when someone comes in specifically looking for it. People are more than happy to take any number of light beers over this stuff.

Can is pretty righteous. The girl is a lot hotter than the regular Old Mil pinup so that's a definite plus. Easy to drink, hard to taste. I don't mind it. I'm not buying this for the taste. I'm buying it because if I don't, it'll hang around my cooler until it expires like all of my Labatt Blue. Let's all be honest here. Light beer is meant for those who don't want a beer gut and a stained, yellowed tank top as their main piece of attire. This cannot be rated as thoroughly as a craft beer. This is a domestic, light, canned beer produced for the masses, not small batch brewed to a 700 year old tradition or some nonsense. For what it is, it's still crap, though."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.5,"2003: (330 ml bottle, ABV 4.5%): Light golden colour, large head that doesn't last long. Initial fresh Heineken-like aroma that doesn't linger, bland watery flavour, aftertaste has a little strange and unpleasant bitterness in the end. So boring they could have named it ""Neville Chamberlain""."
Worst,Foster's Lager,3.37,"25oz can

Pours over a finger of pillowy, slightly fizzy white head into my Kolsch glass. Retention is decent for a macro, the head hangs around a minute or two, but surely fades soon enough. Initial lacing actually looks ok as well.

Nose is pretty standard, light malt, corn, some sweetness.

Flavor has some light maltiness, faint corn, very one dimensional. No hop flavor to speak of, but what do you expect? That said, it's actually not bad, pretty clean.

Carbonation is on the higher side. Light, but has a little body. Not bone dry like some lagers, this has a little sweetness to it. Bitterness is barely there. Overall a serviceable mouthfeel.

Drinkability is great.

Appearance turned out ok. Lacing just barely held on.

This isn't exceptional, but ""clean"" is ahead of the curve for a macro. Overall it's unoffensive and easy drinking. Not bad."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2,"If you want beer that tastes like corn and nothing else, then this is the beer for you. Not the worst beer, but probably never going to get it again in the future. I had this out of a can so maybe the bottle is different though."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.34,"No idea how I never did review this stuff. The iconic oil cans were a big draw for my teen self to feel like I was drinking a grown-up beer. This stuff's not that great, even in the AAL world when compared up against the likes of PBR or Bud."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.48,"750 ml can poured into a tumbler style pint glass.
Brewed in Texas.

Looks and smells decent but taste and mouthfeel are poor. Malty and grainy, not sweet, rather astringent. Highly carbonated, crisp with harsh alcoholic bite. Seems below average even for an Adjunct Lager."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.36,"750ml can

This is the beer I used to steal from my dad when I was [REDACTED] years old, grabbing out of the minifridge while controlling each smooth muscle movement as to not let any sound penetrate up into the upper caverns of my old suburban household. It was just okay back then, now it is pretty awful, caramel malts that are astringent and slick on the tongue, basically tastes like grain and cheap cereal, along with a half shot of even cheaper vodka. Ugh"
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.9,"Not sure why but the name and look really speak to me. Also it’s Australian so that’s cool. Just looks like an old oil can or what I assume they used to look like. Either way, I approve even if it’s just an adjunct, if your drunk enough anything will taste good.

Edit: good is comparative, it taste like oily sandy mud but much better than many other adjuncts. Also cool can."
Worst,Foster's Lager,3.2,"Look is very good for an adjunct 3ish finger head on first pour out of the 750mL can. Laces when I drink pretty well and is a darker straw color but still pretty pale.

Smell gives away some macro properties and has an odd metallic off smell, but the malt comes through, the off smell could be the hops but other than that no standard hop smell detected.

The taste is mild sweet and grainy in a good way if you like malts with a hint of hop bitterness befor the sweet finale, but again the hops are just hinted at.

Feel is smooth and soft, easy to drink, but clearly not light. Very foamy once you sip but in a good way, not overwhelming.

Overall it's good for the price point, about 3 bucks at a neighborhood liquor store. For the only way to get it being in a single 750ml can it's pretty good, but still not super interesting. I would drink again every few months for the novelty of the can."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.69,"750ml can into a tall glass. Best by 2/28/22, so plenty fresh.

Looks nice enough, though pours a little syrupy. Crystal clear pale golden yellow body with good carbonation. Small white head retains well, a little lacing.

Unpleasant perfume/floral aroma.

On tasting, sweet, malty, drying, none of which is in a good way.

Mouth medium, finish initially sweet, then turns a nasty light bitterness.

Overall, while better than many of this style, still not something to be repeated."
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.51,"Light straw color without anything beyond light malt. It’s not offensive, it just has no defining character beyond sweet malt. Cold, refreshing , and nothing else. Light malt how it’s supposed to be. Where’s the hops?"
Worst,Foster's Lager,3.29,"Hot day + ICE cold Foster's = Paradise

Well.... Paradise on a budget!

They only serve giant muffler sized cans here in California, so I got 3 Blue Lagers & 3 Green Ales.

This is the lager review:

Go buy a couple and throw them in the freezer until ALMOST frozen slush. Best if shotguned. (Yup. The WHOLE can.)

Don't worry about thanking me.

Thank the Aussies that made it and the Texans that brew it here in the US!!!"
Worst,Foster's Lager,2.31,"Purchased as a single can from Exxon for $1.99. Poured into a pils glass.

L - Gigantic can aside, it pours a pale amber. Half-finger pale ginger head that dissipates extremely fast.
S - Sweetness. Wheat and corn, a bit of rice, and grass. Not very complex, but not exactly offensive.
T - Tastes like it smells. Relatively sweet, with a strong general grain backing. A bit of a green tea note.
F - Very refreshing. Light carbonation. Easy to drink.
O - As far as single cans go, this is the best bang-for-the-buck you can find at a gas station. Easy to drink, hits the spot on a hot day, and is a relatively inoffensive brew. It's like the Aussie Budweiser. This being said, I've had better beers for cheaper. Taking into account what it's trying to be, it's not bad. Could be better, but not bad. Wouldn't turn down one if you gave it to me, and would probably continue buying one can every few months, but I wouldn't have it all the time."
Worst,Iron City Beer,4.12,"16oz can stamped 0732 (about 5 months old) poured into a becher glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on can. The beer pours bright, light amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. The aroma is mild and beery. Notes of pale malt and mineral mostly. The taste is semisweet pale malt with a hint of corny tang. Mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, very good AAL. I would definitely keep this around if it was local and fresh."
Worst,Iron City Beer,4.71,"As much as I like Yuengling lager, Iron City has it beat. A cool refresher that serves well in the heat of summer and pleases on cold winter nights. Great with food--especially Mexican, pizza or chili--or by itself."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.26,"My punishment for losing a bet to a Steelers fan. Clear pale yellow appearance with a small white head and a little lacing. Grassy, sweet malt aroma, light on the hops, slightly vegetal. Crisp taste, fairly dry, but the adjuncts sink this one. Light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with a short lived finish. Just don’t let it warm up."
Worst,Iron City Beer,4.18,"(16 oz can, 0391 2002; purchased cold sixer from Mineo's Pizza in Pittsburgh... poured into my newly-acquired 9 oz Genesee taster glass... reviewed from the Cortland Motel, Cortland, NY)

L: crystal-clear, pale bronze colored liquid; persistent white cap... collar keeps; laces a bit

S: caramel cookie hot from the pop, kinda Dortmunder golden... corn muffin develops and persists; great presence

T: dry underbelly up front, but expansive, apple tart overtone rushing out... the corn kernel soon takes shape - Miller-like, but more overtly, brashful-y corny - and provides a surprising dimension and depth to its basic

F: slippery, silky smooth texture; mild rolling viscosity; subtle acidic-biting carbonation... perhaps a touch too much plush up front for some; ultimately dynamic and stimulating... certainly appropriately cut and dry

O: their IC light, which I had at a Bucs game a couple nights ago, bore a diluted resemblance to this, but maintained that grainy overbite... pretty solid adjuncted lager, tickling my cornhole, light but greasy... happy with the purchase, and drafting a raincheck for a revisit (1795)"
Worst,Iron City Beer,1.9,"I remember buying this at 25 cents a quart when Pabst was 30 and Budweiser was 32.
When you're underage ,there is a price point of catching a buzz vs economics.
This was that price point.
Highly carbonated and bitter were my memories of this brew.
Drinking a quart on a cold December night was always a trip back in the day."
Worst,Iron City Beer,4.36,I was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Iron City was always my choice of beer. I now live in Florida and I'm fortunate that I can purchase it down here.
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.69,"Native Pa person here, rating a old classic Pittsburg, Pa brew from the days where the steel mill workers made this a city favorite.
LOOK: Pours a crystal clear pale straw yellow/gold with a small white head that settles quickly before disappearing.
AROMA: Grass, corn husk and grain.
TASTE: Actually feel I detect a little caramel. vanilla.
OVERALL: While not a terrific beer by any stretch, IMO not as bad as many here rate it."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.78,"Someone else brews this for this brand. Can looks nice and bright. Not much smell. Taste is just plain terrible, mostly sour corn. Unnatural aftertaste. Some carbonation. I don’t like it. Have a PBR instead."
Worst,Iron City Beer,3.5,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A thin white head drops quickly with little to no lacing. Color is clear gold with mild streaming carbonation. Aroma is mild with grain and water dominating. Mouthfeel is light with a dry finish. Flavor is also mild just some sweet toasted grain and light hop presence. Overall: a decent beer for eating with a burger or pizza, but nothing exciting here."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.16,"Downed a few at a Pittsburgh Pens game cause, hey, when in Rome, but it is even on the lower scale of adjunct lagers. No flavor besides some watery corn and dead hops."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.5,"Another one that I haven't had in 3 decades plus. I do recall being able to get Steeler cans back in the day. The beer is not as fondly remembered. Kind of a gritty, dirty beer. Rates below average."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.89,"You have to be a malt-head to like this lager. (I find it refreshing and almost decent, but this has a very low average rating.)
I also don't think a brewer cheats me when they put in other cereals such as corn or even rice.
Finally, Iron City is a survivor from the 19th Century in a town that survived and prospered again in the 21st Century. For that, I got to give them a hug... even if I find this beer below my average for lagers."
Worst,Iron City Beer,2.94,this is the beer i grew up on. Probably being a bit generous for the sake of nostalgia. Not the worst hometown lager but certainly not the best. Simple.
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.63,"Clear dark amber with a small ivory head that vanishes in a blink.
The aroma is sweet caramel malt and hints of cheap whiskey or rum, some grassy notes.
The taste is also sweet caramel malt and brown sugar or molasses with rum, plenty of alcohol taste and burn. The finish is still sticky sweet with rum notes and just a hint of grassy hops.
The body is full and a bit oily, light carbonation.
Altogether my first problem is rating this as any kind of pilsner, it just does not resemble any pilsner I've ever had. It is more like an extra strength barleywine or maybe a ""boilermaker"". Whatever it is, it is drinkable and packs a pretty good punch for the price. If that's what you are looking for, this is for you."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.75,"I am not sure what I was thinking when I bought this beer. Upon reflection, I feel like a teenage boy who is trying to get away with something and gets terribly embarrassed.

Anyway...I poured this beer from a bottle into a tulip glass. Dark yellow, essentially no head or lacing. Strong booze smell and taste, sort of cheep whisky. It does have some smokiness that does not make it a total loss and it is warming. Not a repeater."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.43,"This beer is hilarious, honestly not sure what this is, looks like piss, tastes like a heavy lager, smells like bready malt and booze, feels like a eastern bloc boot stomp, yikes. It’s decent, but man, the mixed reviews on this have me laughing my ass off"
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.15,"As a homebrewer, Im familiar with the style. Very on par for a Mr. BEER extract kit that the owner boosted with a sugary adjunct, such as honey or way too much sugar. Tastes acrid, sharp & bitter, like most brews from this hovel of a brewery. I tried their Lobster Lover's beer & it was identical. Drinks like what youd expect a Soviet Bloc country brewing adjunct beers & selling at craft prices to taste like. The bottom shelf at my local gas station would all drink smoother than this Slav piss."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.71,"500ml bottle. Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a very, small, white head of foam. It smelled of boozy sweet malt. So much alcohol burn. Little bitterness."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,"Here is a brew I've been cellaring for quite a while as I feared it would taste rancid based on reviews of this site. Let me tell you maybe the bad reviews are due to drinking this too fresh or in the wrong glass or the wrong temperature or improper storage, I don't know. But I am drinking a bottle right now that has aged gracefully for 14 years and reminds me of nothing more than J.W. Lee's Barley wine, the only thing missing is some time in the barrel.

Poured at about 44 degrees into a snifter this beer has an appearance of opaque orangish, rustic brown with minimal head. The aroma is of sweet hints of subtle wet cardboard and wet basement yet has some bourbon, caramel, vanilla, fruity woodness mixed in. The flavors are very much of the aroma with some hints of tobacco. I'm telling you if I didn't see the bottle I would have thought it was a J.W. Lee vintage. For $3 this beer kicks ass! It might just need to age and be stored properly. This is for sure the best Lithuanian beer I have ever had. I give it a 5 because well I see nothing wrong with it and if I see it again I'll be sure be buying it again. Think about it J.W. Lees is $10 for 11.2 oz and this is $3 for 22oz."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,3.23,"Rinkuškiai ""Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils""
16.9 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, coded ""L.13021""
$2.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Cool label. I'm not sure what the santa hat is doing on a guy who looks kind of like the devil, but OK. And what is ""naturally fermented beer""? Is there an un-natural way of fermenting beer? I have not heard of that yet but I digress. It pours a clear amber-orange body beneath a short head of bright white that is fizzling away before my eyes. At 15% alcohol though I guess that a little of that is expected. Ahhh, wait, although it's clear, not quite fingerprint-through-the-glass clear, but clear, the bottle says it's ""partially filtered, bottle-conditioned"" and maybe that's what they mean by ""naturally fermented beer"". Unfortunately partially filtered is not the same thing as bottle-conditioned, and I highly doubt you'd get much additional carbonation at 14+% alcohol unless you had a really tolerant yeast strain, but OK, here I go getting off-track again, back to the beer. There's some higher alcohol and ethyl acetate in the aroma. Not good. There's some adjunct laden and bready & caramelish malt as well but the nail polish aroma is distracting - big loss of points on that count. Of course, to be honest, I was kind of expecting that. This isn't from Russia, it's from Lithuania, but that's close enough and I've found a lot of the beers from the Baltic region with higher gravities and alcohol contents suffer from hot and fast fermentations. Personally I believe that they actually like this over there, but different strokes for different folks, right? At least it doesn't taste like anti-freeze was added, that's pretty much soley a Russian thing. Moving forward, and if you think I was kidding I wasn't, the flavor reflects those higher alcohols and ethyl acetate as well. It's not the worst I've ever had but it's still not good. I'm only a couple of sips into this and I'm not sure I want to finish it. I fear I might black out, or maybe do something weird if I get drunk on it. It's malty though, and at least I like that; and it's balanced by a low-level bitterness and the hot alcohol which equals a dry finish. There are, unfortunately, no noticeable hops. Perhaps some leafy, grassy, and spicy undertones are there but that's it. No, this is more like the malt prior to distilling Bourbon. Given that it's flawed it's hard to score it well, but at the same time I have had worse so it is what it is, and it gets what it gets. Medium-full in body with a dextrinous side and a moderate, soft carbonation that leaves it smooth and doesn't amplify the alcohol or heat that's there. Not the best by any means, but certainly not undrinkable."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,5,"The look is that of a Samuel Adams Boston lager. The smell and taste is basically the same. Decent beer that has been sitting in a rusty bucket, it even slightly stings. THE FEEL!!!! This is where this beer shines. When you consider the alcohol content, it is so light and easy to drink. It has the alcohol of four beers and comes in 16.6oz bottles!
It doesn't taste like one of those iced beers, it's not thick, it won't make you puke if you chug it(which has happened to me with King Cobra and Natty Daddy). If you put a little thought, and calculate the amount of alcohol in this drink, the taste and feel are far better than anything else in the range. I will definitely buy again."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,1.06,"This was so disgusting, I didn't know how to describe it. It pours decent, but the smell is overwhelmingly terrible. It wreaks of stale, disgusting bourbon mixed with a even more stale and disgusting beer that's mixed with a stronger taste of alcohol than Everclear. Just don't do it. Stay away from it."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.57,"This is an amber colored brew...slim head and a medium clear complexion. The aroma is boozy with an off-putting caramel scent. Strong, alcoholic, sweet, and ill-conceived. It's like a sweet, alcoholic excuse for a beer. Not at all reminiscent of a pilsener. Disappointing."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.3,"I received a single bottle of this Lithuanian ""Imperial Pils"" as a ""gift"" from a friend and didn't know what to expect. I've found some Eastern European beers to be surprisingly good. Poured from 16.9 oz. bottle into pilsner glass. It pours an orange-bronze color with a very thin, ecru-colored head. It smells of sweet malt, brown sugar, caramel, and dark fruit. The smell is vaguely reminiscent of a Barleywine. The taste, though, is awful: cloyingly sweet with astringent alcohol; there's nothing subtle about this . . . and nothing good, either. It's bereft of carbonation and the booziness is over the top. This may be the least pleasant beer I've had. Don't let the look and smell fool you; it's simply dreadful stuff!"
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.29,"From the bottle in a snifter. This head banger lager pours a clear and bright amber
with a light head of foam that fizzles flat and...well.....flat out gone. No nothing to speak
of. Nose of brown sugar stewed apples and astringent alcohol. Flavors follow with stewed
apples and slick malts with a warming almost clean finish. Decent mouth feel for such a beast;
slick, smooth, and warm as a camp fire in the belly. Overall, if you want a fast beer buzz this works
fine.....you can also get light headed fast by holding your breath and standing up fast from a seated
position......just about the same effect. Poor mans barley wine with little else to it other than a wino's
desire."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.4,"(16.9 oz bottle, code L.05271... red tag around the bottle neck, touting its '15%' potency... poured into a fluted goblet)

L: chill-hazy, medium amber-colored liquid... sizzly head builds then implodes, no foamy collar to speak of... no suspended sediment - I guess that's a good sign... does clear up... if this was cognac, it looks just fine - for beer, a liquid red flag

S: cheap homebrew barleywine, perhaps vaguely like an English strong ale... no boozy smell, very weak alcohol really - which is a bad sign, something might be off... no pilsner-like hop profile... potent medium-dark malt aromas, little else

T: nothing 'pilsner'-y here... just about syrupy-sweet, toasty-acidic... background peppery twang... weed stem bitterness and flavor in the aftertaste... dominant flavor left over is that of having just power-licked an aluminum pot

F: approaching full-bodied, certainly some warmth in the back of the palate... take away the flavor, this flows and feels like a liqueur... between the alcohol and bitterness, my taste buds feel like they been deep-tissue massaged by newsprint paper

O: tastes like vodka-infused wort, at best - doubt this product reaches 15%... don't be tempted by its low price, it's low quality... one of the most amateurish commercial beers I've had in recent memory - like a fermentation failure salvaged and bottled... dumped the remaining 3/4 of the bottle probably"
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.45,"From the bottle, it pours amber with virtually no head and few bubbles. The nose gets the alcohol and some malt. The mouth is the same - no carbonation bite, a little bit of malt and lots of alcohol."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.43,"L - Bronze
S - Reminds me of barrels, wood, malt
T - Alcohol, grain, malt, alcohol
F - Like fire and brimstone
O - The death of my liver is palpable."

Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.88,"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong alcohol, sweet malt, caramel malt, burnt toast, dark citrus, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of an Euro Strong Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, strong alcohol, yeast, slight dark citrus, slight caramel malt, and a hint of burnt toast. Overall, weak appearance, strong body, decent blend, but still average at best."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.67,"An impressive amber color with a minimal tan head that was not replenished due to the lat of carbonation ad dissipated quickly.

Sweet liquor, apricot brandy maybe.

Overly sweet with some alcohol - but not nearly as much as the 15 abv listed on the label.

Thick, very syrupy not surprising but not appreciated.

I'm sure there is a time and place for this one."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.91,"I was down in DC around the 2015 holidays (ostensibly) to visit my aunt & uncle, but partially to seek out new beers to drink. I was on my way back to their place from the Friendship Heights Metro station when I saw a window advertisement for World Market and something flashed in my mind that they carry a small assortment of beers & so I went in to take a look. The selection was not all that impressive, although I managed to build a mixed sixer and on the way out, I spied this bottle sitting on a clearance table. While most people might run in the other direction from such things, for me, it was a clarion call! This brewski and I are crazy!

From the bottle: ""Partially filtered, bottle-conditioned"".

I Pop!ped the cap, but I was uncertain as to how to proceed with that ""partially filtered"" business. I went with a gentle pour that produced only wisps. An agitation of the liquid stubbornly brought forth a momentary finger of tawny head that quickly reverted to wisps. I spilled a little on my hand and it proved to be some of the stickiest stuff that I had ever encountered! Color was solidly Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-plus quality clarity. The nose was extremely sweet, like toffee or caramelized sugar. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, but its decided lack of carbonation kept it from achieving fullness. It had a decidedly dollop-like quality on the tongue, though. It just sat defiantly, awaiting my next move. The taste was really sweet & sugary, beyond simple maltiness, this was like dumping a bag of sugar into a pitcher with Kool-Aid mix, adding water and stirring. It was sugary & malty to the point of saturation. Having established that piece of the puzzle, the next thing to hit was its heat. As a previous reviewer remarked, at 15% ABV, this is up there with wine, or put otherwise, this is a 30 proof beer! Phew! They could have distilled this and no one would have been the wiser. I didn't really catch it until the finish, when my gullet suddenly lit up like I had swallowed barium. This leads me to my next aspect - it is a Sneaky Pete! The labeling cops to its intensity, but the taste gives nothing away initially, and then, out of nowhere, it comes with a rabbit punch to the fontanelle at the base of the neck, rendering one nearly unconscious! I consider myself a seasoned beer drinker, but this had an immediate, adverse effect on me. Why would they brew something this strong? It must render the average consumer crazy! The big takeaway on this, for me, was that it was not unpleasant (think Manjit & Ravinder Minhas products), making it just that much more dangerous. I felt no guilt or shame, just a creeping drunkenness that seemed to increase with every sip."
Worst,Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,2.53,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy copper coloring with a thin halo of white head. Aromas of tangy sweet malt notes, and some farmhouse skunky characters. Flavors are caramel rich and tangy forward, like a straight malt extract. This is swill, seriously. Wow. The body is full and slick. There is no mistaking what you are suffering through on this one. Good lord. The higher ABV builds a warmth as you go, and the finish has a solid linger of shame and regret. In all honesty, this is an extremely out of balance, over-boozed take on an imperial lager, and it missed."

overall-A very good drink"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,5,"My favorite beer by far. I know it's sweet and some may say it's not a beer. I don't care! I love that it tastes great, unlike ANY of the other ""Ritas"" I've tried. I just wish I could find it in the Texoma area!"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.21,"Pours a headless orange yellow. Nose is canned mango juice and nectar, and unlike other entrants in the Rita series, does a good job of hiding the booze. Taste follows, nectar dominant, and only on the finish does the cheap alcohol begin to raise its head. Of the Rita's I've sampled, the best of a sad bunch."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,4.71,"Mang-O-Rita has lots of fizzy bubbles and no foam nor lacing. The appearance is opaque orange. The aroma is of mangoes and pale malt, and the flavor is the same, with a Splenda brand sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Mang-O-Rita finishes (high-fructose corn syrup) drying. It's top-notch, for what it is, but I just don't like what it is.

RJT"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,3.16,"(25 oz can, code 19173; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)

L: as is typical with this line (shaking my head, being too familiar with it, but only review-cently), hazy liquid with a fizzy, fleeting foam... liquid color is almost on par with Irn Bru or an Igloo cooler

S: mango Jolly Rancher - nothing more to add

T: 'mango' soda syrup?; bit of spectrum swipe of medicinal, phenolic, saccharine flavors in the finish... intensely (sugary) flavorful, but only 10% malt liquor-ish, if that...

F: slight fuzzy fizz on contact; vaguely drawn-out/slick... like a flat soda halfway through... extra 1/4 pt for the ethanol being super smooth

O: another gap-filling review... flavor-assaulting, soft-drinky, fizzy liquid boozy candy... like a fizzy Boones Farm thang... at this age, I rarely try to get drunk, but I'd hate to be reduced to relying on this to take me away; blech!... (1529)"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,1.54,"Whoo boy, this one is something. In my earlier drinking days I'd go grab one of these and down it while I watched my friend Kelly stream games. It was an abhorrent experience for the most part, every swig made my face contort and exhale like a noob drinker.

Overwhelming fruity smell. The overall taste is artificial mango, cheap margarita mix like what they put in the dollaritas at Applebee's, and beer water. Syrupy as it gets. I only punished myself with this a few times and apparently the other flavors are worse, so I guess I should be thankful. Not sure why I ever had one more than once."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2.4,"Is it ok to essentially start a review with ""well this is the least shitty variation"" of this beer? I think its a good summary of the review. Anyways, pours as usual looking nothing like beer, looks more like some tonic water with nothing but alka seltzer and some coloring added. What a weird fizzy creation. Aroma was slightly mango-esque, so it didn't miss the mark by much there.

Taste, the mango character is also there in the taste. But its all downhill after hitting that extract. Still super fizzy. Lacks a malt, yeast or hop aspect of the beer, but hey, this hits that adjunct spot with some sugar added in to cover up the alcohol. Its nowhere near as offputting as the lime one is."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,2,"Bought a 25oz can $2.69 Marukai
Strong smell of mangoes
Bright orange color
Light carbonation
Heavy mouthfeel
Very sweet mango taste, alcohol aftertaste
Overall not good as is. It does deliver a mango taste so my ratings reflect that. If you blend it with ice then it become a decent blended drink as the melted ice helps to reduce the sweetness. As is it is more like a juice concentrate. Blend it with ice as I think is intended then you can up the score to a 3.0 as a margarita mix. I definitely would not categorize as beer."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,1.61,"Poured into a tall, cold glass filled with ice. Looks appealing, like mango punch. Tastes like a strong cheapo wine cooler. Reminds me of Cisco, although it's been a long time since I've had one. I'm not a big fan of mango, so I might enjoy the other flavors more."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,3.47,"I'm not giving this a full on review, it's a simple kind of mixed drink that tastes a good deal like Mango with a mild bitter kick to it, it's enjoyable and 8 oz is all you need."
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,4.45,"I have long loved this site and joined just to review this amazing concoction and try and salvage it from being the hated red-headed stepchild of the beer world. I base my ratings and review on this being a malt beverage, not comparing it to beer standards, because it's not beer (of course, neither is Bud Light, but I digress, another review, another time).

For what this is supposed to be and compared, say, to FourLoko Mango, Mike's Hard Mango, and some brand I can't remember but had jalapeno in it too (also available in a tall, cheap, 25oz can that screams, ""Choose me to make bad decisions!""), I think it's hands-down, THE BEST. I LOVE the mango-y-ness of it, I love the smell, I love the biting carbonation. What I don't like is it's a little too sickly, syrupy sweet and it packs a massive BAM in calories, over 200 for an 8oz can!!!! They are addictively drinkable and I find myself sometimes craving them. Of all the Rita's, it's my fav, followed by Cranberry. Mix half Lime/half Mango for a great taste experience. :-)"
Worst,Bud Light Lime Mang-o-Rita,3.65,"Clear light orange. White head.
Smell of mangos. Guava. Sugar. Alcohol
Taste is the same as the smell. Very sweet. Feel is high carbonation. Boozy.

Did not like."
Worst,Pure Blonde,2.57,"When I was a fresh-faced, just out of high school 18 year old, I loved my Pure Blondes. Truth be told I didn't know shit from shoe polish when it came to beer, and I think I enjoyed it for it's light, crisp taste, and it's tremendous marketing at the time. The bogan truck driver going through the pristine forest, where angels were bottling Pure Blonde out of a river, only for the truck driver to grab a Dove out of the area and open up a beer with the dove. It's fallen by the wayside for me ever since I had my first Pale Ale, and since then I've watched it go from 4.9% ABV, to 4.6% ABV and now a rather pityful 4.2% ABV.

CUB have also played around the marketing of this beer, over marketing the fact it's ""low-carb, and vegan, and organic"" etc.

Let's see if I still have fond memories of my 18-year old self. Poured into my pint glass from a 375ml can

Look. Having poured this out of the can aggressively, it's only produced a fingers worth of frothy white head that's dissipating quickly. Standard Aussie Lager look, clear, pale golden, maybe slightly lighter than your more full strength options. Clear, filtered, bog standard.

Smell: Grassy/Citrus hop notes but definitely Pride of Ringwood in there as well. Slightly malty, slightly grainy, slightly bready. Not too bad.

Taste: Smooth, mellowed malt sweetness, followed by a slight bitterness. Slight grain flavour, but a few seconds after the sip I do pick up a chemical aftertaste.

Feel: Highly carbonated, but easy drinking. Goes down smooth. Highly refreshing. Would be worth a can or two to quench the thirst on a hot summer day.

Overall. It gets a pass from me. Maybe it's old nostalgia from my adult teenage years, but I can't hate it completely. It's not nearly as good as I remember it from being 18, and I think the reduction in ABV from 4.9 to 4.2% is playing a part on that, as the flavours are quite mellow.

I don't buy into the whole low carb charade a lot of Aussie beers are going with now. It's probably one of the better 'low-carb' lagers out on the market as it's not overly sweet, and easy drinking. I'm unlikely to buy this at the pub, or a slab of it unless it's on special"
Worst,Pure Blonde,2.8,"A pale, clear lemon yellow with a small but lasting and lacing creamy white head. Aromas of grain, straw, lemon pith and grass carrying through onto the palate. Light in body with medium to full carbonation, a firm but thin mouthfeel with a short finish of lightly bitter citrus zest and grain."
Worst,Pure Blonde,2.57,"Format: a 355mL green bottle with a pretty standard macro label.

Appearance: a pale amber yellow in colour with sparse carbonation. A fluffy white head that drops to a thin film, sporadic lacing. Okay.

Aroma: not very much there at all. It was at this time I noticed it was a low carb. Oh God.

Taste: actually picks up a bit here - some light but quality grains but that's about it. Still, okay for a low carb.

Aftertaste: drops away very quickly, as expected. No hop bitterness, just a slightest touch of grain.

Mouth feel: light in feel with a moderate to higher carbonation. Feels pretty much like a standard macro lager, which isn't bad for a low carb macro lager.

Overall: if my brain fell out and I decided that low carb beers were a good idea (even though carbs are low in beer anyway, and it is kilojoules to watch out for), this wouldn't be a bad one. Fortunately I am still have my full faculties however, so this is going into the ""not bad for a low carb, but still pretty ordinary as an actual beer"" category. Probably okay for AU$43 a case for the hottest of hot days, but I'll still just have my good old Carlton Mid - cheaper and better."
Worst,Pure Blonde,2.78,"okay, I will admit it, there are times, trust me, when the Australian sun is just too much for a session of big beer, even normal craft can be heavy in the oppressive heat. but we have to drink beer right? what can I session when its 100 and something degrees out? this beer is the answer. its pleasant enough in aroma and flavor to not be offensive, repulsive, or even make you feel like crap. its a pretty well made, extremely light lager that drinks just a little easier than tap water. well carbonated, it packs a lot of refreshment value when its ice cold. the color of its name, this beer has many advantages over the other affordable light beer. it tastes better, costs the same, and seems to be just about everywhere. I like it for what it is, and it kills a corona, or whatever else people usually drink on the beach. best low carb/cal beer on the aussie market."
Worst,Pure Blonde,1.54,"Pure Blonde is the go-to beer of a fair amount of carb-conscious Aussies, and it is retailed fairly widely on the back of Carlton’s substantial marketing budget. You will find it on tap at almost any drinking hole with little regard for beer connoisseurs.
L: Yellowy golden
S: Unpleasant to smell, if any smell at all.
T: Largely tasteless, quite bland.
F: Heavily carbonated, probably the brewer’s attempt to try and inject some level of excitement to this beer.
O: When faced with a line of macro beers, I would choose it, if only for its ‘low carb’ and well-marketed aesthetic appeal (Gives me a headache, but individual experiences will differ). Before my beer baptism of fire, this was one of my go-to beers, when I jumped on the ‘low carb’ bandwagon. I definitely steer clear of this beer unless it’s free."
Worst,Pure Blonde,2.69,"It is what it is, and doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Mostly inoffensive. Grainy with some skunkiness, probably attributable to the green bottle, and maybe some slight fruity character. Almost flavorless, thin and watery, albeit light and refreshing, especially during a hot summer day (in January) overlooking a beautiful expanse of Bondi Beach while eating fish and chips.

Sidenote: beer is outrageously expensive in Australia"
Worst,Kronenbourg,2.75,"March 2002: Average French lager - easily drinkable, but Kronenbourg 1664 is better..... Probably still my opinion today, but it's been years since the last time I bothered to buy it."
Worst,Kronenbourg,2.55,"One of the local options in the Strasboug, Alsatian scene and one of the ""big five"" French beers of the 1970s, Kronenbourg was probably the ""best"" of the big five and definitely the most popular and prevalent in Paris at the time. Though the Alsatian/Strasbourg scene was the best of France, it never compared with all that was going on across the great Rhine River."
Worst,Kronenbourg,2.78,"Trying not to bring back any Euros, I picked up a couple more beers to finish of my French trip. This one was cold.

It is a yellow lager with nice lacing. The aroma is faint but not funky. The taste is thin and slightly sweet. The aftertaste is non-existent.

Not recommended. It's not worth your while."
Worst,Kronenbourg,2.51,"500ml Keg at Au Rendez-Vous des Artistes, Montmarte, Paris (€5):
Quite a light looking beer but one that sits nicely in the glass with a decent looking & quite fluffy textured head that also had good retention. The nose was definitely basic with some slightly skunky notes & a little corn showing in the early going followed by the odd vegetable adjunct. The taste of the beer was similar to the nose with some corn & a light sweetness alongside some faint bitterness & the odd malt. It was very much a macro pale lager with moderate carbonation & a crisp, slightly dry finish but it wasn't one I'd hurry back to."
Worst,Kronenbourg,4.05,"Kronenbourg Original has a thick, mousse-like, white head, a bubbly, golden, clear appearance, with lots of white sediment, throughout, and heavy glass lacing. Aroma is of banana, white bread crust, and white bread toast. Taste is similar, with sharp hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Kronenbourg finishes medium dry.

Worst,Kronenbourg,2.79,"Very average lager; intrigued because it's from France but besides being refreshing on a hot, summer day, there isn't much that I can say about this beer. I wouldn't seek it out again. Very light (4.2 ABV), very little smell that I can discern. Nice head and lacing which generally maintained throughout. Drink this if you are sweating on a hot day and you need to get rehydrated. :) Otherwise, not worth it....reminds me of Bud Light."

Worst,San Mig Light,2.55,"This one pours a very light yellow color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like essentially nothing.

The only redeeming quality of this beer is that when it is very cold, it is refreshing. There's essentially no flavor to it - just crisp ""coldness."" There's a little bit of grain sweetness, and it finishes surprisingly dry.

This is very light bodied, watery, fairly crisp, and decently drinkable.

I would only drink this beer at ice-cold temperatures. That's the only way it would be enjoyable."
Worst,San Mig Light,1.5,"330 ml can, brewed under licence by PT Delta, Indonesia. ABV is 4.9%. Clear pale yellow colour, low white head. Sweetish ""industrial"" aroma, notes of artificial candy. Thin and fizzy mouthfeel. Nearly void of flavour, quite dry, only a touch of sweetness in the background. One to forget."
Worst,San Mig Light,2.74,"A bit harsh for a light beer, but the bite is not to harsh to enjoy. It works well on a hot day, but not when trying to analyze the flavors. Aftertaste is a bit metallic."
Worst,San Mig Light,1.16,"Reminds me of soda water without as much flavor.
Lacks character or taste.
This is a meet market brew aimed at those looking for a hook up at the local watering hole.
Kind of a white zinfandel of beers."
Worst,San Mig Light,3.02,"San Miguel of Spain has this weird off-shot in the Philippines for God knows why, from whom I stumbled upon a ""masterpiece"" again. First was their staple, the Pale Pilsener I think (which was crap), this time it is their light version - which fortunately seems to have relieved us of its excessive crappiness!
I mean, it is still below average, for being a tasteless, overcarbonated dry Adjunct - but let's admit, even still it is better than most of the Euro Lagers we have here in Hungary.
So I grant it a Royal 3 Overall. Not for being that good, but for it could have been much more worse."
Worst,San Mig Light,2.85,"Looks: Clear, bubbly and blonde. Has a perfectly white head about an inch thick that lasts a minute.
Smell: Smells like beer mixed with water with added caramel and hay.
Taste: Good enough.

Overall: A good LIGHT beer for those nights that you want to relax and not worry about your growing beer belly."
Worst,San Mig Light,2.71,"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a clear yellow color with a small y white head.

Nothing great, but probably a great type of beer to put away during a hot day at the beach."
Worst,San Mig Light,2.14,"Pours fluffy, strong carbonation. Looks no different than any other light lager. Smell and taste are both mild. Enjoyed out of the bottle in to a 10 inch glass. Good drinking beer for casual conversation."
Worst,San Mig Light,2.29,"A college chum of mine recently did some overseas charity work and brought back various southeast Asian CANs for me. More proof that it pays to advertise where The CANQuest (tm) is CANcerned!

From the CAN: ""Since 1890""; ""Only 100 Calories""; ""Pale Pilsen""; ""Expertly Brewed and Produced by San Miguel Brewery Inc. for Domestic Sale Only""; ""Keep the Philippines clean. Dispose of properly.""; ""San Mig Light only has 100 calories[,] that's why you'll feel light as you enjoy its full beer flavor that's brewed just right. A superior beer brewed in the San Miguel tradition of excellence.""

It was a tougher Crack! than usual, perhaps because the vent was more oval-shaped than circular. Once opened, I CANducted a gentle Glug, followed by a swirl in the glass, producing a finger of foamy, bone-white head with minimal retention. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 - 2) with NE-quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. It is going to be really cold tonight! Nose smelled lightly sour, and it was hard to pinpoint the culprit, but the Ingredients mentioned ""Cereals/Sugar"". Ah, how reminiscent of the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs and Light Lagers were the norm. Mouthfeel was thin, watery. No surprise. The taste was, well, rather tasteless. It had a light grapiness with a mild biscuitiness, but it was so light as to be well under the radar. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing, but a glass of water would have had the same effects. This was not bad, just really bland and boring."
Worst,San Mig Light,3.2,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a golden straw color with a two finger head of pure white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew rather nice for a light brew in a clear bottle. While I was expecting tons of skunk, there was none, instead the brews aroma was quite strong of a cereal smell; sorta like cheerios. Along with these smells comes some corn syrup and a bit of caramel as well.

Taste – The taste begins with a bready taste mixed with some caramel. As the taste moves on, some of the caramel fades, being replaced by a blend of light fruits and corn syrup sweetness. All the while some hay and grass develop in the middle of the tongue, with them only fading later more toward the end of the taste. With the flavors that are left at the end of the taste, and with a little bit of a cardboard taste that comes at the very end, one is left with a malty, lightly off (cardboard and corn) taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. For the somewhat off and lighter abv. of the brew the feel is quite appropriate and makes for a more easy drinking brew overall.

Overall – A decent light brew overall. Its aroma was very surprising to me, but its flavor was a bit lacking. Nothing all that hot here, but hey, if you are drinking a light beer looking for tons of flavor, then you are automatically barking up the wrong tree. Also for only 100 calories for the 11.2 fl.oz bottle, this light beer packs more punch then the average light beer so…."
Worst,San Mig Light,1.99,"Crystal clear light straw gold with fine and fluffy pure white head of lower retention. Not bad lacing though. Smells like table honey. Similar to a Dos Equis (I should know, had one earlier today). Taste is way different though. Honey component is still there, but for the most part it's — I don't know what else to call it — dry hay, with kind of a medicinal (but non-phenolic) finish as well. While all of this doesn't make me gag, it's far from a compliment. I'm not a horse. I pity the people who feel they have to drink this over not only other San Miguel offerings, but most other light beers. I wouldn't even call it bad, I just have a hard time recognizing it as a beer. At least as far as flavor is concerned. Appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel are all okay or tolerable. Very light body, lots of spritz. This makes it easier to ignore what it tastes like, I think. Surprisingly astringent for what it is, but bubbles up after it's been swallowed. I don't weight my ratings according to a beer's style or price point. I rate them all as 'beer'. So while this may be a decent bang for buck, or even alright for the style, it's just not a good beer, or even a good light beer. Glad I got to try it though."

There is hardly any aroma. A little malt if I try hard.

On tasting, well, hardly any taste. Bland, thin, light.

Mouth closer to thin than medium, finish a little off as well.

Overall, pretty poor beer. Nothing to it. May as well drink water if you care about carbs and calories. Most of this is heading for the drain."
Worst,I.C. Light,5,"This beer is Pittsburgh in a can. It perfectly embodies the hardworking, blue-collar essence that is Pittsburgh. Brewed with blood, sweat, tears and just a hint of smog, this beer has a delicate taste that takes you back to the glory days of J&L Steel. For only $20 for a 30 rack, you’re doing yourself a disservice by not enjoying this godly nectar."
Worst,I.C. Light,2.42,"I was delighted to find a twenty four ounce single can of this at Giant Eagle while in Pittsburgh for a concert last weekend. The fact that it had all the different Pirate logos from year's past all over it made it even better. The can was pretty cheap as well. Making things greater still, there was beer inside the can as a bonus. It was light and mostly tasteless and fine. It may of also have been less filling, at least that was the rumor I had heard."
Worst,I.C. Light,2.25,"A blast from the past, was never one I drank on a regular basis, only from time to time. Never really liked it much, bland and unremarkable. Not quite poor, but barely above it."
Worst,I.C. Light,2.79,"This one pours a light and distinctive piss yellow, with a small fizzy head and not much lacing.

The aroma is basically nothing, which is not surprising.

This is your typical low end light lager, nothing more and nothing less. It's kind of just sweet and corny, with a light bitterness. There's no discernible flaws, but really nothing to speak of as well.

This is very light bodied, and very watery, but ultimately pretty drinkable.

There's not much to report here. There are better light lagers, but there also certainly much worse light lagers."
Worst,I.C. Light,3.76,"Obviously this beer will not hold up to the likes of any craft beer, but for what it is, it is quite good. For under $20 a rack its a good deal. Perfect for parties or tailgates. I have to admit I am a bit biased being from Pittsburgh, but even so I swear this is a much better beer than bud light or miller lite. If you ever find yourself in Western PA be sure to give this one a try."
Worst,I.C. Light,3.49,"Pours a clear gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, slight citrus hops, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of piney hops. Fits the style of a Light Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, slight citrus hops, hint of caramel malt, corn, and a hint of piney hops. Overall, good feel, decent aroma, appearance, and body."
Worst,I.C. Light,1.62,"Comparing only NA beers, BUD Light and Miller Lite, not my favorite Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.
Color was golden straw, far better than Bud Light!
There was NO aroma, no head, no carbonation
There was a nice malt flavor, but I could detect no hops flavor.

NOTE: I may have a stock of older beer, because it says brewed by Iron City Brewing Company, Latrobe, PA and the label is all Black except for the Gold IC and white LIGHT."
Worst,I.C. Light,3.6,"Look - slightly more color than most light lagers, more tint that most, head is white but must pour aggressively to get much of one and like other light lagers it does not stick around to lace the glass

Taste - is slightly grainy and malty and mild hop taste, again comparing to the other light lagers it is more flavorful

Feel - mouth feel is somewhere between lager and light lager but not thin like a Mich Ultra

Overall - it is the best of the light lagers and my go to if I am going to drink light lager. It's 94/95 calories and 2.8 carbs is friendly to my diabetic system. I think Pittsburgh Brewing Co. has done the most within the light lager category."
Worst,XXXX Gold,2.14,"XXXX Gold. The midstrength heart and soul of Australia's. Yo'Yo's with VB as the nations most popular beer, but in Queensland, it's holy water. I've personally never liked it, too watery, too thin, too tasteless. But today, I'm going to take my beer goggles off, drop my snobbery,ayour thirst quickly, easily, with no fuss, and not get you too smashed up in the unforgiving tropical heat that is Queensland.

Look - 2.5/5: The iconic gold can, referred to as a Mango in Queensland (drinking out of the can is known as 'sucking on a mango') is pretty Iconic. And you gotta admit, bright yellow can, Australia, sunshine, happiness.
Poured into a standard Ikea tumbler, rough pour, an extremely filtered, clear golden colour. Slightly darker than the can itself. Frothy bubbly white soapsuds head, it's a classic Aussie adjunct.

Smell - 2.25/5: Corn, Wet grassy hops and bitterness, provided by the Pride of Ringwood obviously, some light biscuit malt. I've smelt this time and time and time again, mix and match any Aussie adjunct lager.

Taste 2/5 - Cereal grain, light bitterness from the hops, light maltiness, watery, almost like I'm drinking a flavoured sparkling mineral water, beer flavoured mineral water with a slight chemical aftertaste.

Feel: 2.25/5 - Highly carbonated, watery, thin, but on a 35 degree, 80% plus humidity day up in Far North Queensland, that's what you need.

Overall: Outside of Queensland, the Northern Territory, or North-Western Western Australia, this is a terrible, terrible beer. I know it's a midstrength lager, but hell, even Great Northern Super Crisp has a better overall flavour than XXXX Gold.
However in those aforementioned months, particularly during the summer months of the year, this is an excellent brew. It's thin, crisp enough, highly quaffable, and being a 3.5% beer, you can drink a few of them and still be in a condition to do stuff afterwards. And that's where and when I'll accept XXXX Gold as an acceptable beverage. Because those are the conditions this beer is brewed for. You wouldn't go drinking a super thick IIPA, or a stout in those conditions, no. And you shouldn't be drinking this in the Snowy Mountains of NSW in the depths of Winter (unless you were driving, you were being sensible, and there's no other light-mid option). To me it's always tasted like a beer flavoured mineral water."
Worst,XXXX Gold,2.85,Gold in color with with excellent clarity. There’s a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and covering all but a sliver of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of corn and a hint of grassy hops. I’m tasting a bit of diacetyl and some grassy hops at the back of the palate. The mouth is watery and thin.
Worst,XXXX Gold,2.9,"Best by August 20th 2019. Can.

Looks gold enough to me. Pretty fluffy head of foam, lacing is good.

Simple nose of corny grain, some but not enough of that Aussie malt, mild touch of hops.

No surprises in the taste. Light flavours, it is 3.5%abv, of corn/grain, tiny malt sweetness, low presence of hoppy bitterness. Served cold cuz I reckoned that would put it at its optimum.

Pretty decent mouthfeel considering.

Nice to try, once."
Worst,XXXX Gold,3.12,"The very definition of a mid beer...
An Australian domestic made for the working class, sitting at 3.5% and 375ml, which equals 1 “standard” drink. Allowing people to manage their alcohol intake at places where you need to drive, out in the bush, the beach, the pub home after work, this beer is extremely popular because it targeted a demographic of people on the move.

Goes down best with fish and chips from your local, or after mowing the lawn on a hot and humid Aussie day ice cold. 3.5% means it lacks much punch however, it can feel a bit watery as well as lack carbonation from time to time. Clear, bright and orangy-yellow, one finger of head when poured, however due to my fondness of this domestic drop, I prefer I straight out of the dark bottle, its just an icon of suburban Brisbane. Not a classy beer but a well mapped and demographically targeted beer that’s just very average. It is popular here for a reason!!"
Worst,XXXX Gold,4,"The weak little brother of XXXX Bitter. A welcomed introduction to allow red blooded Aussies to consume 2 tins in the first hour, and 1 every hour after that and still be able to drive home without the risk of losing your licence for 2 years and having your car crushed under the draconian, nanny state eye. Thanks XXXX.
PS. It's actually pretty ordinary, but hey, any beer on the way home is better than none."
Worst,XXXX Gold,2.07,Draft at Nannup Hotel and Pub. Tastes and smells like wallpaper paste. Clear hold n body with weak head. Bland and not very tasty These pasty lagers sure are popular in the bush.
Worst,XXXX Gold,3.52,"From bottle, Pours golden yellow with a medium head. No nose that I would smell. Watered down hints of hops and malt, but they do work together. Nice summer quencher."
Worst,XXXX Gold,2.15,"Well, well, well well well - XXXX the beer Queenslanders love to hate - nowhere else in this big brown land are people so vehemently against one of their own iconic products, but nearly every single Queenslander I met when I lived in Brisbane hated this brewery and the beers they produced. I often found myself wondering who was drinking all the XXXX and how they could stay in business, then a mate told me ""It mostly gets sent down to NSW, Victoria and SA"" like some form of cruel punishment to the other states for being terrible at the State of Origin. Then I found out that XXXX got bought out by Kirin, which explained everything. Anyway despite my polemic I had an ice cold XXXX Gold once and didn't mind it so much (as I recall it was a choice between that or a VB).

Poured from a 375ml Stubbie into a nonic pint.

A: Like a plethora of Aussie macro Lagers XXXX Gold presents a clear golden body with a white head that fizzles to nothing.

S: Barnyard apples that have been dropped on the floor mingle with grainy malts and vegetable hop notes. Certainly not as bad as I remember from the Bitters aroma, however it must be noted that this is the watered down version.

T: Grainy malts mostly. There is a hint of apple and the finish is an awkward dry cabbage flavour (Pride of Ringworm strikes again!). About as refreshing as a glass of sheep dip on a hot summers day (and I'm not referring to the whiskey of that name).

M: Understated, watery and light bodied with a crisp medium carbonation.

D: Look this is really a winner when the other options are VB, Toohey's New and XXXX Bitter - aside from that there is little reason to touch this with a barge pole, unless your plan was to knock it off a table to smash it on the ground with said barge pole.

Food match: Whatever they're selling at the footy match you're currently attending as that is the only reason you purchased this beer in the first place.

Side note: The classic New South Welshperson joke goes that ""Queenslanders call it XXXX because they don't know how to spell BEER"" [Yeah there's definitely some inferiority complexes at play between those two states]."
Worst,Molson Canadian Ice,2.41,"Finale from the mixed pack. Never knew they made an ice version of this. Had the original plenty of times though I haven't seen it in quite some time..but maybe that's because I haven't looked for it considering High Life is always my go to cheapy. The word "" Ice "" I almost always another way to say "" hangover imminent "". Lets do it.

Looks the part. Clear yellow, big white eggshell head with a shit load of carbonation. Nothing left after a finished glass.

Chemical comes to mind on the nose with fair hints of alcohol. Adjuncts are all there as expected. Creamed corn dominant.

Taste luckily loses the chemical factor. Thank Satan, thought this was about to be another Labatt maximum Ice disaster ( The worst disaster since 9/11 ). Adjuncts amp up, hillybilly asshole level corniness.

Feel is rather sticky, sweet and corny with a super level of carbonation. Swallows with a shallow alcoholic bite and leave your mouth dry as a transexuals vagina.

Overall it's pretty average. The scent is a throw off, the feel is a bit odd but otherwise it's just your standard run of the mill brew. Probably not worth the imminent hangover."
Worst,Molson Canadian Ice,2.25,"Because it was on a sale rack next to the cash register.

Standard version of an ice beer. Good Lord, there must be a real demand for this stuff because everybody and his brother seem to be making multiple versions. It's lightly colored, lightly hoped and lightly flavored with a higher ABV being it's primary asset. Maybe the target customers really don't mind a lack of malt into their purchase decisions, and that's ok too. Like roaches and spiders cheap beer has it's place in the overall scheme of things.

Just the thing for the Ice Beer ticker who rarely travels North."
Worst,Molson Canadian Ice,2.5,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has slight malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.28,"I had a bottle In an Indian restaurant. Fizzy golden-yellowish, white head that dissipated quickly.

Grainy smell, and the taste pretty much followed the smell. Heavy malty taste up front without much finish, no surprises.

Bottom line: it was OK with my meal, but got less and less appetizing as it warmed. I’ll try not to order it again."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.79,"Turbid pale yellow with very little white head. Some splotches of lace.
Smell is beer like.
Taste is American macro style lager but without the clarity. Tastes slightly phenolic.
Mouthfeel is light with modest carbonation. Finish lightly sweet.
Overall with no year date this could be many years old. Lots of suspended particles. I hope this beer doesn't attack my system tonight."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.09,Bland ugly looking beer that had done separated sediment. Smell is cloying sweet of corn and honey. Taste is far better than the nose. Tastes of lemon and champagne are bright and zesty leaving a mild vinegar finish. Finishes crisp. Quite fascinating for an adjunct. Really hits the spot with spicy food.
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.81,"Golden Eagle Lager Beer has a thick, slightly off-white head, a clear, very bubbly, deep golden appearance, and lots of thick lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. When I swished the bottom and poured, some yeast chunks were seen in the foam, and the foam turned tan (at the top). The aroma is full- pungent, sweet, malty, and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped. The flavor is really strange. There is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer, so it has a pronounced rauchbier character. One will also pick up sweetness, barley malt, and hops, but the smoke is overriding. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Golden Eagle Lager Beer finishes crisp, refreshing, and smoky. Overall, even with the bizarre nature, it is still quite good. Check it out, for an unusual experience.

RJT"
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.84,"A: The beer is crystal clear light yellow in color and has a moderate to high amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down but consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface.
S: There are strange and unpleasant strong aromas of burnt rubber and melted plastic in the nose.
T: Similar to the smell, the taste has flavors of burnt rubber and plastic along with notes medicinal flavors and some smoke along with some hints of cooked corn.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: I had a difficult time sampling this beer because its smell and taste of are downright nasty. If you thought skunked beer was bad, this one is at another level."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.41,"Found some of this at a liquor a store I frequent. This is my first beer from India. Poured into my pint glass with some vigor and got no head. Pale yellow in color. Nose is extremely faint. Musty and some lemon rind. Taste caught me off guard. I felt like I was sipping something that sat in a ceramic jar in my grandparents basement. A musty/earthy(in a bad way) flavor, similar to saki, that is hard to get through. It then transitions to pennies and a unpleasant dryness. Sadly my $4.24 got poured down the drain."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.04,Got a bottle of this from a little shop I used to go to. This was a new release for them and the bottle looked like it was over 20 years old. I should have known right then and there to steer clear of this. However I got it and tried it. It was probably one of the grossest beers I've ever had. It was salty... Just straight up salty. I got about half way through it and poured it down the drain. Just gross.
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.7,"Mohan Meakin Limited - Golden Eagle Lager Beer
No freshness date, but there is a Mfg. Date (MAR 19 - must be almost a year old) and a Batch No. (3815)

The cap opened with a soft hiss. I assumed that there was probably not a lot of carbonation, and tasting it revealed that it does, indeed, have a moderate, very fine bubbled carbonation.

I noticed that there's an odd color to it as poured it. It's golden, but there's something else as well. I don't know if I'd call it pinkish, or perhaps greyish, but there is a certain cast to it, and it appears 'dusty'. It's also a bit hazy, but I expected that. It built a very thin head of white, but that dissipated quickly. With a limited carbonation that's to be at least partially expected, but I'm sure there's more going on than that.

In the nose I found some malt and a touch of grassiness, but it didn't appear fresh at all. In fact, blindfolded I might not even have guessed that it was beer at all. It's not off-putting though, it's just more like an Eastern Bloc lager than a European ""Pilsner"".

The flavor is interesting, so at least it's got that going for it. It's malty, with a bit of an adjunct side to it (...some kind of unrefined sugar), and some dull, kind of grassy hops. It's also a touch buttery with a hint of DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide/cooked corn) and even a touch of plastic (or is that burnt-plastic?). Obviously there are some fermentation issues to be dealt with, but again, they're not really off-putting. It's hardly bitter, although there is some (probably around 12 IBU's); and it finishes pretty much the way it began but a touch dryer. Oddly, I kind of like the buttery and almost smokey phenolic... it's weird, it's interesting... but it's not a very good example of the kind of beer I believe they were trying to make here. Or perhaps not. Maybe this is exactly what they wanted. It does seem like it would go well with Indian cuisine. And that makes me question whether this is bad at all, or not? Maybe it's good that we have this weird beer. Maybe it's good that there are odd derivations out there. When everyone starts trying to produce the finest European-style golden lager, everything becomes homogenized, and we end up with ONE beer made by everyone. Hmmm... didn't that happen with American lager?

As for the mouthfeel, I did like that. It's light in body, but also a bit sugary, and it appears almost light-medium. The carbonation is soft, and very fine bubbled (there's not much to be released), and it's fairly smooth across the palate despite the lack of body.

Drinkability? It's a light bodied, fairly sweet beer. That gives it a little something. But it's also not quite what you might expect a beer to taste like; and without hop flavor and bitterness it's not particularly refreshing unless you drink it ice-cold. And that's the way it should be 'enjoyed', because the phenolics become more pronounced once it's warmed."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.49,"A: poured a light golden orange with pale yellow highlights that had a thin ring of head with very little lacing sticking to the glass.

S: plums and vinous notes greeted me first but had a blend of grains but it had a weird earthy aroma that I could not put my finger on it.

T: the flavor was also big on the plum but had grape accents with good sweet malt backing. It had berry fruit notes to it that might be juniper berries.

M: the brew was light body with a fair amount of carbonation which had. Slight sweet but crisp finish.

D: it drank really good and went even better paired with some shrimp tandoori."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.29,"A: Against natural lighting appeared a golden-honey with a brilliant clarity, enough so to easily read the finest of text through. Random instances and burst of carbonation appear while the head was dirty white in color, porous and soapy in appearance, while short in execution.

S: There was a bit of green leafy hopping on the nose, quite pronounced with instances of candy oranges and white sage honey. There is a backup of herbal notes, oranges and a sweet white peppery twang on the finish. Overall sweet but somehow intriguing per style.

T: Sweet honey and corn syrup composes the initial flavor. Oranges, with a warm sweetness of butter scotch and a slight touch of herbal terragon best sums things up. Overall not as interesting nor complex as the nose led you to believe. There is a bit of ripe fruitiness on the finish as well some leafy green hopping. Overall offers a bit more spiciness and flavor complexity then your average American adjunct so ill leave it at that.

M: Light mouthful but feels a bit bigger at times due to the slippery texture and watery honey like feel. Tame carbonation lacks the crispness or should I say ""fizziness"" that most American adjunct lagers are noted for.

D: Once again, considering by style this was somewhat more bearable then your typical beers offered by BMC. A bit overly sweet certainly limits this in multiples, which sadly is the whole concept of a light lager, so it bears a double edged sword. A bomber pushes my patience and tolerance but I finished it."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.95,"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, some malts. Taste is light, a bit of cough syrup flavor, finishing a tad bitter. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a mediocre offering."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.23,"Trip to the I.D. always turns up a new beer or two.

REally sugary aroma and not much like malt. In fact, the more I try to pin it down the more I think it smells like brown sugar. No hops to speak of and a little fruit/estery for a lager.

Pale gold with lots of rising carbonation but no head. Has a little hazy apperance too.

Flavor is tough to like. Tastes a lot like honey malt with just the barest amount of bittering hops. It really comes across sweet and lightly malty, again with the sugary emphasis and not malt.

Medium bodied with a light but refreshing carbonation level. The mouthfeel is one of the few positives I can find to say about this beer.

Well it is drikable but more like a soda pop. It's pretty sweet and carbonated and taste not totally unlike beer but the sweetness is really not good."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.38,"A: Pours a slightly murky pale straw body with almost no head.
S: Sweet malts, corn, and honey.
T: The honey comes through pretty strong, with a sweet corn flavor following. Finishes with a scotch-like bitterness.
M: Pretty standard; good level of carbonation, good cold.
D: Again, pretty average. So far probably one of my favorite lagers to have with Indian food."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.21,"This might be hands down the worst beer I have ever had.

I really hope that I just got a bad bottle.

poured clear and yellow with a very minimal white head.

Not much in the way of aroma. An odd smell that I couldn't place.

Tasted...by the way I place the smell...like iodine! Second taste...same thing.

To be honest, I could get past that. I have no idea what the mouthfeel was like. I would have to say that the drinkability was poor.

I hope I just got a bad bottle."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.43,"Appearance: Clear and gold with fizz/carbonation. Tiny head

Aroma: Something smoky.

Taste: Sweetish, and the smoke thing comes along as well..either way, its not a pleasant combination. Its not terribly offensive, but I wouldn't go around praising this.

Mouthfeel: Light and carbonated..not much else. Goes down okay

Drinkability: Taste is mediocre, mouthfeel is similar to most cheap macros..where do I stand in line?!? It goes down okay. If its there, I guess I'll go for it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,2.57,"Purchased in a six pack from the local BevMo, chilled for two weeks, and served in a pilsner glass. I'll just cut to the chase - I normally don't read other reviews before I personally review a beer, but I didn't know quite how to describe the taste. If there is any one thing the taste reminds me of, it's the Lysol disinfectant that used to come in the brown bottle here in the states. The rest of the factors about this beer are pretty much average. I can't really think of any occasion where I'd want to consume this beer again. I might give the rest to friends to see the reaction on their faces as they take their first sip."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.3,"Thanks to xnoxhatex for sharing this.

Transparent gold, visible carbonation, with fizzy foam that settled to a thin ring. Honey sweetness in the aroma, with an unusual note of smoke.

Flavor was much like a smoked Helles. The aftertaste was clean, with a dry finish that followed the oddly phenolic smoky taste. Some honey and grain husk. Fairly low carbonation, thin but not unpleasant. I would give this another chance if I saw it. This wasn't as bad as some other reviews made it out to be."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.83,"650 ml bottle:

Pours bright, clear straw yellow with a thin white head that lasts a few seconds before vanishing.

The smell is some husk, a bit soapy, something oddly smokey-ish.

The taste is sweet - in an artificial sweetener sort of way, soapy, some wet cardboard. As is progresses there is an odd smoky touch that seems out of place. It's not quite as pronounced as in some other offerings from India, but is enough to be out-of-line with the style, and along with other flaws in here, this just ends up being something rather of a mess. Lightly sweet, with almost no bitterness in the weak, fizzy finish.

Light-bodied and rather fizzy, the aftertaste - thankfully mild - is not very pleasant.

Almost half-way through, I considered ""drain pour"", but I managed through it - something of an achievement. This is not one I would recommend trying - weak, soapy, wet-cardboardish, rather fizzy, a bit smoky - rather a mess all-in-all."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.85,"A-Poured a rich amber-yellow w/some sediment. Formed a weak head that rapidly disappeared.
S-At first when cold, aromas of band-aid and medicinal character. As it warmed, smokier sweet malt aroma emerged with faint apple.
T-Band-aid and plastic/medicinal phenols dominate, but there is also a slightly sweet pleasant malt in the background.
M-Overall mouthfeel is not bad...a little heavy-bodied for the style, fine carbonation, and good balance of sweet and dry. The mouthfeel is this beer's best attribute, but the nose and taste are so off it isn't enough to redeem it.
D-Pretty bad. I paired it with spicy Indian curry w/shrimp (tasted beer both before, while, and after eating)."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.71,"Pale golden with plenty of carbonation racing up to a thin white head. Not much head but it sticks around.

The smell is very unusual. Smells smokey to me, not the usual smoke you find in beer but almost a burnt rubber or plastic aroma. Never smelled anything like it, and it is a bit harsh.

The taste starts with a macro lager like sweetness, but quickly becomes the same as the smell. I've never tasted anything like it. It certainly isn't good, but it also isn't quite as offensive as one might expect.

Fairly typical macro lager type mouthfeel. Thin and fizzy. Not quite to the point of watery though.

Won't finish it, I'm a bit afraid of what could possibly generate its unique flavour."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,1.48,"Another beer of the world sample..from India no less. The last Indian beer sucked, let's see if this one scores any better. Poured a clear, amber color. Very fizzy with no real head retention what so ever. Aroma is, as 1 reviewer put it, funky. Mostly a mollassess smell, no doubt the 'sugar' put in the recipe. I didn't care for it.

YUCK!. Easliy the worst tasting beer I have ever had. An almost medicinal taste, very similar to a weak disinfectant, Dettol, or something. There is a faint hint of malt that breifly coats the tongue and some hop that bites, but I can't get past the initial taste. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit thin, but given that it's from a warm climate that may be understandable.

I know you are not supposed to slam beer, but I tink this 1 gives a person a reason."
Worst,Golden Eagle Beer,3.06,"another special at Beers of the world $ 1.57..., i was scared to try another Indian 1,but...here it goes; it pours a pale yellow w/ aslight head which dissapates quickly, little lacing ; winey, slightly hoppy spice aroma, macro-type malt aroma throughout ; flavor, more of the same, a vinegar-like tang w/ a ricey malt prof.,watered down taste, a tiny bit of hop in there ; lite thin body, but perfect for the style ; not bad for an Am. macro-style, better than some A-B stuff..."

T: Smokey with some sweet honey malts up front. Butterscotch notes sneak in as this warms along with some lemon hops. finishes grainy with smokey notes & lemony hops

MF: Medium bodied with light carbonation

Worst,Dutch Gold Imported,1.25,"In Ireland for 12 days and nights. Handful of Euro notes to spend before next days departure. Just enough to buy 3 of these that cost 1 Euro apiece.
This pours a crystal clear uninviting pale gold. It does pour a head of foam. It is the fastest disappearing head of foam I have ever seen. No side glass lace period. Looks like a sample you drop off at the lab for your own personal lab values
Aroma: A very little bit of grass.
Taste: Is this really beer?
The only reason why this beer gets more than the bare minimum 1.00 is that there was nothing offensive in the odor."
Worst,Dutch Gold Imported,1.67,"Appearance: Poured from can into (non-real) pint glass in low altitude Galway, Ireland on September 18th, 2010. Pours a clear yellow with an abominable, thin head that quickly reduces to nothing. A pathetic appearance that looks a bit like urine - can't wait.

Smell: A nasty aroma of stale hops and overcarbonation. This isn't looking good.

Taste: Barely one note of light hops bleeding into a sharp finish. There's very little to say about this beer's taste. It's a bit like water with a beer flavour; in fact the main note is water. This beer is bland, uninspired, unambitious, and poorly built, even for the price.

Mouthfeel: Wet and fizzy throughout. Unrefreshing. Neither smooth nor coarse, but discernably awful.

Drinkability: At least it's a bit better than most American macro lagers. At this price range, if you're just looking to get intoxicated, you're better off going with Steel Reserve. This beer might taste better on the way up. If I weren't a broke student I wouldn't be having another."
Worst,Dutch Gold Imported,2.49,"I am not sure, but think this beer can be bought only in Ireland, where is quite popular in discount stores.

Pours golden with arge head that slowly fades, scarce patchy lacing. Aroma is very light malty. Taste is light lemony hops with some sweetish malt, nothing complex. Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation.

Overall, it is below average supermarket lager."
Worst,Molson Canadian Light,1.02,"Wasn't even going to write a review on this until I was a few sips in. Just wait. Anyway three tall boys of this swill was gifted to me by an uncle who won some in store credit to the tune of around $500 on some truck stop game machines. Thanks man.

Look - Transparent yellow without a head and an assload of carbonation. No stick.

Smell - Here's where things really get fun. Absolutely astringent in every sense of the word. All reference to beer was filtered from this thing and replaced with leftover industrial cleanser.

Taste - If you've read the scent, you already understand the taste. Bitter as all get out to boot.

Feel - Heavily carbonated like champagne on steroids and far too thick bodied for its own good. Swallow induces the gag reflex and nearly makes you spit up the beer.

Overall - Absolutely atrocious in every sense of the word. Figured this was going to be another generic light lager without a frill that scored in the mid 2's and forgotten by tomorrow morning. Instead I will remember this for all the wrong reasons. A light lager...hell any adjunct lager style is supposed to be easy going and poundable without a care in the world. This thing fails in every single regard aside from maybe the appearance. Up there with steel reserve and labatt maximum ice in terms of worst tasting beers I've ever had the displeasure of consuming. Any other light lager you can grab at a supermarket is like a TIPA compared to this. Seriously. Even something as putrid as NATURAL ICE tastes like heaven compared to this.

EDIT AS OF 2/20/18. Tried to drink another one. Absolutely terrible. Sweaty and chokingly bubbly. Guess the rest go to my neighbor."

Worst,Molson Canadian Light,2.92,"Such a disappointment. Look is poor, scent is hardly there, and the taste is almost vinegar like. On top of that the mouthfeel is pretty poor, so all in all a pretty poor lager."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.11,"(12 oz bottle poured into a cold 14 oz shaker by the bartender at Embassy Tavern in Denver last night... review copied from notes taken on my phone)

Home fries? Hash browns? Corny grain must (referring to its aroma)... (palate) Weird mix of corn tortilla and barley pancake... (feel) bitter, pithy bite... (back to taste) slight touch of (the) hop(s)?... all 3.5 except 4.0 (for) feel

what I can add from memory: don't know what I was thinking, but I gotta lower the marks for smell and taste, as its initial aromas (and they eventually vaped off) were truly off-putting... aside from its introductory stench, Lone Star is a pretty basic adjunct lager, but on the lower end of its echelon... only a when-in-Texas thing I guess (2031)"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.35,"Drank from the can. Date on can: Dec 05 2022.

Other reviewers have already summed up the vibe: clear, yellow, fizzy, perhaps a bit darker than your typical American adjunct. Aroma is sweet grains, corn, bread and yeast with a bitter, grassy hoppiness. Taste follows the nose well. Very reminiscent of Coors for me, with a clean mouthfeel and solid flavor for the style with a bit more balance than most adjuncts, which tend to be too sweet. I quite enjoy the body of this one, it's not as thin and ultra carbonated as a Pabst Blue Ribbon, actually has a tiny bit of chewiness.

Figured I had to try this while I'm living in Texas and it actually slightly exceeded my expectations. Coors was my previously highest rated American adjunct macro, and I think this one might slightly edge it out due to a better aroma, but it's very close. This isn't something I would pick up routinely unless I was in a monetary bind, as it is priced quite modestly, but it certainly gets the job done, most especially on a hot summer day. My rating is based on style, not on my personal preferences. You could definitely do worse in this category. Cheers!"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,4,This is just one of the beers from my past military service while I was stationed in the state of Texas. It was our go to beer and back then was THE BEER to be drinking. I remember it as being great ... and it's before the current beer craze.
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.97,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden color iwht a bright white and soft head. SRM of 6. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of pale malts, bread malts, bread yeast, and some corn adjuncts in the middle. Yeast on the finish. (3.75)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts, corn adjuncts in the middle. Some bread and yeast. More adjuncts, corn, carbonation to finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Stronger carbonation. A yeasty and full mouthfeel to finish.

Compared to Miller High Life 6/16/22: Pours a darker color, stronger aromas. More yeast, bready, corn adjuncts. Less smooth simple pale malt. Less carbonation and sweeter.

Compared to Venice House Lager 6/16/22: Pours a darker or paler, clearer appearance. More pale malt aromas, less sweet biscuit. More clean, pale malt. Lighter and cleaner. Simpler.

Overall: This one exceeded my low expectations. Nice pale, bready malts and yeast here. Bready, yeasty, full-bodied and maintains a nice bread flavor. I'm not sure why I expected less, but this one dranks pretty well. I'll seek it out again sometime for another review (Rating: 3.97)"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,2.72,Drank from can - guessing it looks like fizzy yellow beer cuz that’s what it smells and tastes like. At Lucy’s in Austin day drinking and listening to music playing it served the purpose.
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.52,"Pours a clear pale yellow with soft head.

Smell is crisp and floral with notes od crackers, citrus and wheat dough.

Taste is light and crisp, a bit crackery and floral. Notes of wheat dough and some citrus. Soft bitterness.

Mouthfeel is thin, well carbonated.

Overall, a refreshing, easy to drink lager. Just what it intends to be, I think."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.23,"16 oz. Can poured into Imperial Pint glass

Overall: The taste and flavor are what I expect from an adjunct lager but the lack of bubbles, head or lacing is disappointing. No complexity.
Pair with fast food, pizza, or just drink ice cold on a hot day."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.55,"Classic chill hazed gold with a moderate white foam head settling to a thick blanket leaving chunky, spongy layers of lacing on the glass.

This is almost like a wheat beer, but lighter. It even has hints of banana esters, but at least omits the phenols of a hefeweizen. Still, it's sort of confusing.

Having this straight out the bottle while sitting on the front porch of the gun store at Ten Bits Ranch, the chances of line contamination are nil, but I have no frame of reference for this brew otherwise. I'm actually surprised I've never had this beer during any of my several other trips to the Lone Star state, so I'll just have to take this as it is. Until next time, that is!"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.21,"I think we have a nice and fine perfectly good beer here. No, it’s not Steve McQueen as Jr. Bonner; and no it’s not Mrs. Texas posing next to a steer. It just does the trick like the Rangers couldn’t in the 2011 World Series.

Giddy up."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.43,Despite what the retail may portray its a surprisingly tasty beer. This is a beer that makes craft heads say at least it aint bud light. With a great price point it's hard to have a negative standpoint. Has more flavor than your average lighter beer so expect a little more calories than a michelob
Worst,Lone Star Beer,1.81,"12 fl. oz. bottle, in the Houston tent at the ONS 2008, Stavanger. Golden colour, low head. Moderate sweetish fruity aroma. The flavour is very bland, slightly sweetish with minimal hops. Poor."

My Local Package Store now features a ""$1 "" rack with some at 2 for 1... I saw the 12 OZ bottle right next to a couple of dented BUD cans so I bought all three for $ 2.50 ... the Lone Star was missing part of it's LABEL....

PURE BLISS!!!!"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,1.17,"This beer is appalling. Seriously just atrocious. Pure Texas corn water. You could literally tase the corn syrup. Nothing natural going on here. I mean, my god after one sip I got a headache. Mass produced macro lager beers can be good. This just isn’t one of them. We are striking out in the state of Texas. Nothing but steers and shit beers!"
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.21,Pours a nice gold with a three finger head. Smell is familiar adjunct lager...grainy and malty. Taste is also familiar with some corn sweetness and an unwanted hint of citrus but not totally unpleasant. Easy drinking and inoffensive.
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.28,"Golden yellow color, crystal clear, white, fluffy head that doesn't hang around. Smell of earthy grain, no depth. Taste was non offensive, not too sweet, somewhat dry and balanced finish. Overall, a touch above average for the style. Colder the better. 6 pk bottle $6.99 + tax, best by 12/31/20."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,1.59,"Pours a classic pilsner yellow, kind of paler than most, little to no head. Smells like grain, bread & grass. Tastes pretty much follows the nice, has a nasty aftertaste to be honest. Very high carbonation, thin feel to it. There's far better beers to drink out there than this one."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.09,"I was finally got to try one, kind of regional thing living in the south, It pours a straw yellow color with very little head that is white. Not much of a smell of anything maybe some yeasty bread to it. The taste is fine about what I though, watery yeast with a mild hop finish. Overall it was what I call a middle of the road beer, not great but a decent one to have on a hot afternoon."
Worst,Lone Star Beer,3.29,"Poured at fridge temp from a 12-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Aggressive center pour yielded a finger of sudsy white head atop a pale straw-colored body. Minimal head retention, no lacing. This is MUCH better cold. Aromas of corn, light grainy malt, and wet straw carry over to the palate. Light mouthfeel that becomes watery as the beer warms, due to low carbonation. A hint of tart green apple creeps in at the finish, which is mostly dry. Overall, about what you'd expect from a mass-produced adjunct lager."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.25,"Tried this one a while back hoping that maybe I would like it better than the original. I did not, just a weaker less flavored version of pbr. Could have been negatively impacted by my lifelong disdain for pbr, but I don't like it."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.13,"Clear pale gold with three fingers of white three minute head. Splotches of lace.
Smell is grain bin.
Taste is grains bread crust and a tiny bit of grassy herbal hops.
Mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation. Finish is lightly dry and mildly bitter.
Overall for the style it is just O.K. Drink cold for best results."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,2.22,"Not much to really say about Pabst Light. Looks, tastes, and smells like municipal water. While I wasn't expecting it to be great, it still managed to disappoint me. One to get if you're in for disappointment."
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,3.31,"Pabst Blue Ribbon Light.

Ahhh yes, this is quite comical. Never even knew there was a light version of good ole PBR. Drank about ten thousand regular ones on my college days. Friend came over with a mixed thirty of "" who knows what "" out of his now deceased grandfathers basement. Not even sure if this stuff is brewed anymore. Oh well, for the sake of experimentation!.

Look - Surprisingly deep yellow with a big frothy white head that pops and splats like soap bubbles. Carbonation is fairly high as expected. Head actually retained quite well and left a bit of lacing to my shock. 3.5.

Smell - Grains are on high much like its older brother. Adjuncts are clearly apparent though do not lead the way which is always a plus. A bit of an alcoholic smell despite the low ABV. 3.

Taste - Bit fresh bready grain ordeal going on right from the get go. Adjuncts fall to the back end and you're met with that slight grape flavor Pabst is typically famous for. Must admit, it tastes exactly like its big brother. Even if this beer is old it has held up quite well. 3.5.

Feel - The body is as watery and smooth as ever with a massive dosage of carbonation. Feels thin, even for a light lager. 2.75.

Overall - I'm honesty more impressed than my score may lead you to believe. I will admit I have and always will have a soft spot for PBR and they managed to pack the majority of big brothers flavor and all aspects into a little brother version. Cannot complain a bit . 3.5"
Worst,Pabst Blue Ribbon Light,1,"This is ridicuolous, I hope the russians can sleep well knowing they took over and ruined the last good thing we had. I have one, and have not drank it out of principle."
Worst,Schaefer Light,4.42,It goes down like water a crisp no aftertaste beer... it's not the best but it was the first beer I ever drank age 11 lol... nostalgia! It's the beer my dad drank until it was rolled out and no longer available at your everyday corner store... Man do I miss this beer...

M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent beer"
Worst,Schaefer Light,3.28,"It's silly to attempt a philosophical description or review about this beer or any other in it's class. If you are buying it, there is a reason and that reason is you are looking for a good value beer. Schaefer Light is an excellent value beer.

Do you really care what it looks like when it's poured? Why would you even be pouring this beer?? Drink it straight from the can on a hot summer day.

Like most every other macro or American adjunct, the aroma is grain, sweet, some corn.

The taste is where Schaefer Light shines above it's brethren. It leaves absolutely no aftertaste at all, finishing clean and crisp. Extremely clean, absolutely refreshing. Medium carbonation, great mouthfeel, and completely enjoyable.

I know it's cliche or chic to say how much of this you consumed in college when your tastes were unrefined or that it's the worst beer in existence, but Schaefer Light is actually a great tasting, refreshing, value beer perfect for a 90 degree day, or when you want to put many back and don't feel like crushing a huge IPA with an ABV over 8. Very enjoyable."
Worst,Schaefer Light,1,"Across the board gross. Worst beer in existence. Pours with barely any color and a bit of foamy head on top. Aroma is weak watery corn adjunct, hay, water, blegh. Flavor follows this with a dirty gag-inducing finish. Light on the palate and the only flavor is the lingering vomit flavor that makes this not drinkable even for beer pong. Handed it out to plenty of people who came to our place for a party though."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.75,"The beer pours an extremely pale and washed out yellow golden in color. There is a short and short-lived head of white foam.

The aroma is slightly sweet grain, metallic, slightly funky.

The taste is old cooked grain and some grass.

It is very refreshingly carbonated. The regular Schaefer is much better. This isn't terrible for a macro American adjunct light lager, but that only goes as far as it goes (which isn't far). Like most beers of this genre, it is better straight from the can."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.75,"The CANquest lives...
A silver can proclaiming: ""Proudly brewed in the United States of America using the finest quality ingredients.""
Uninspiring, clear yellowy liquid, topped by a large, bright white head. Foam slowly shrunk to a thin floating cap. Some whiff of cereal grain, mild sweetness. Typical lager flavor (however mild it may be), a bit grainy, some adjunct-like sweetness. Mouthfeel and body was thin and watery, slight sticky sweet aftertaste.
Average at best, nothing bad, as expected for a light lager. Thanks Woody"
Worst,Schaefer Light,1.78,"*consumed from a room temperature glass mug

A - The color is a clear lemon jolly rancher. Or maybe one of those pale yellow diamonds. But don't be misled. This beer is no diamond. Pours a standard hotel towel color white fluffy head. Very bright very bleached.

S - Well bad news first. Summer officially started here this week. The kids are out playing. The weather is nice. Imagine that old slip-n-slide getting pulled out of the attic and dusted off. That slightly worn creaky rubber plastic smell. Now imagine a mother skunk sliding down that damp Tarmac. That's tge image this beer gives me. Normally these adjunt lagers have vague smells of corn sugar and processed rice. This bad boy doesn't even have that. It's the beer that just never was.

T - As you can now imagine. There's not a lot going on here. You know that sceene in Back to the Future when Marty starts to fade away. That's this beer. The time stream has been changed and you never actually drank this beer.

M - Tough to comment on. Left over slipnslide water from the above image perhaps.

D - It's affordable. That's worth something."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.7,"Purchased in Alexandria, MO, which is right on the Iowa border. Geographically and culturally, it's one of the most depressing areas I've ever been to. The brokenness is hard to describe, since it doesn't fit into any of your typical templates of poverty or decay. It's a forgotten, dying area. The population dwindles every generation. No one remembers when the place had any sense of having a future. It--it's been decades since failure became a reality, in those parts, and the people there have become strangely comfortable with it.

And, well, don't that vibe come close to mimicking the aesthetic of retro beer? Of course the reality of the matter is, as always, scarier than the Disneyfied fashionistic version of the things (side note: isn't it sad how Disney, MTV, and the New York fashion scene all share the same basic aesthetic now? At least shittiness used to come in different flavors.)

(Side side note: isn't it sad how all these retro beers are brewed by Pabst, meaning by Miller? At least blandness used to come in different flavors).

(Final side note, passing as my review: this is absolutely indistinguishable from PBR light. Trust me, I know.)

It's all an illusion, man. Even the poverty. Even the scariest, most depressing things have become co-opted, absorbed into the horde. This is what it is, and what it is is passable, because that's the scariest part of everything, man, the fact that nothing ever seems that bad."
Worst,Schaefer Light,3.92,"Schaefer Light has a thick, white head and a clear, straw appearance, with a pretty good amount of bubbles streaming up. Some sheet lacing is left behind. The aroma is slight and sweet, and the taste is likewise mild and sweet, but this particular light beer had a surprisingly high amount of flavor, even though no particular ingredient shines through. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Schaefer Light finishes crisp, refreshing, and easy drinking. Overall, I was happy to see that this brand had no foul or ugly mineral water aspects. I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it.

RJT"
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.94,"12oz can, pilsener glass, 'FEB1411' printed on the bottom.

Quite the looker for a Light Lager; medium yellow, sterily clear, with good head retention in super bright white.

Light corny aroma, a little grain, and something vegetal.

Unsurprisingly, there isn't much flavor. Pretty much the same as the aromas but sweeter than they suggest. A little dryness.

Just what you'd expect, fizzy yellow beer.

It works pretty well for games such as beer pong, flip cup, and, of course, the fusion flip cup beer pong. Yes, I am in college. Just don't do those things too often, it ain't good for ya."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.68,"Huge thanks to Mar for sharing this American classic.

The beer pours a very light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and nothing else. The flavor is heavy on the grain and heavy on the corn. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not terrible, but a beer with no good qualities. Avoid this one."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.44,"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is primarially of corn. Taste is very weak, some corn and malts, not much going on here at all. Feels light in the mouth and does have decent drinkability. Overall there is nothing to recomnend about this beer."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.12,"A - Clear yellow that is closer to water than what I normally recognize as beer. The three fingers of head quickly disappear to no head. No lacing, no nothing.

S - Corn, grain, corn, and maybe some malt if I'm being generous.

T - Grainy, slightly malty. This is about average in the light lager category, not impressive in the ""beer"" category.

M/D - Goes down like water, drinks like water, what else is there to say?"
Worst,Schaefer Light,1.56,"Look: Yellow pale color, bare amount of foam; Smell: Vinegar with lot of carbonation; Taste: Mineral water, at least don't taste bad; Mouthfeel: Watery and extremely fizzy, very light body; Drinkability: A light beer made with mineral water and nothing else."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.75,"CAN you dig it? This was on my ""Wants"" list for a while and all it took was a weekend trip to Baltimore to fulfill my desire.

The pour created a massive two fingers' worth of bone-white head that actually crowned above the rim of the glass before slowly reducing to to a dense cottony mass. The beer's color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light cereal/grainy quality underlain by a mild lager sweetness. Nothing new here, folks. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with a mild sweetness on the tongue. Again, nothing eye-opening, but not dreck, either. Finish had a light honey/lager sweetness which was less-than-satisfying, but not horrible, either."
Worst,Schaefer Light,2.13,"Typical straw yellow colour with a god head of foam.

The smell is also typical for the style. Grain, a wee bit of malt and some slight hoppiness.

The taste is lightly flavoured with some grain, light malt, and some slight bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel is as thin as it can be and gets very watery.

Another ""winning"" light beer.

Btw, I used enjoy a few regular Schaefers when it was around."
Worst,Boris Bold,3.62,"500ml can, purchased across the border in Dunham.

Beers like this bring back memories of all of the strong lagers I enjoyed back in the late 1980's and early 1990's in Europe. Some were harsh and some were sweet, all have a fun memory tied to them. Bright and perfectly clear golden hued brew. Mild sweetness with a bready maltiness in the nose and on the palate. Faint cooked veggies and some faint caramel hit the tastebuds. Ample hoppiness for the size and the dryness of the beer, alcohol is very noticeable ... warming but not out of place. With each sip this brew grows on me, enjoyable."
Worst,Boris Bold,4.3,"I guess this is the first positive review of this brewery, but I actually really like it. The high abv is masked by the sweetness and it is an extremely smooth beer. The color is an attractive, clear, dark gold. To compare this to Budweiser is harsh. I find it quite delicious and I can't wait to try the even higher abv version."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.37,"Boris Bold is not a looker - I thought the French had a flare for fashion? There's nothing aesthetic about this (supposedly) golden lager, it is regrettable in every single aspect: the tarnished tone and dulled highlights, the polluted complexion, the total lack of head or lace.

Boris, however, is Bold alright - it smells boldly of sugar, corn syrup, and alcohol. I had someone else try it first just to make sure it wasn't poison. It's almost as if the brewery was attempting to make caramel by dissolving sugar in hot water and then, for whatever reason, they opted instead to ferment the mixture. This is sweet enough to pass for a children's cereal.

Though largely insipid, the flavour still manages to be unpleasant. It tastes like a watery concoction of white sugar, ethanol, and creamed corn kernels (with either the yeast or alcohol adding vaguely fruity esters that lend it a kind of cleaning product characteristic). Hints of brown sugar or caramel are constantly sprouting, but they are without accompanying texture (very watered down) and quickly extinguished by the burn of alcohol.

The skepticism with which I re-approached this beer has proven to be well-founded. I first tried Boris Bold at a time in my life when I found Corona and Heineken perfectly enjoyable lagers - and even back then I found this revolting. It's been years since I could consider those mass-produced lagers even remotely acceptable, so imagine what I make of this now.

Boris Bold is the polar opposite of Boris Organic, which is clean, agreeable, and flavourful - it is it's evil brother. Alcoholics looking for a quick fix could do worse - and, to be sure, that seems to be the brewery's targeted demographic - but no average drinker should subject themselves. The vintners of Alsace, like the German brewers across the Vosges Mountains, have nothing to fear of Brasserie de Saverne; this is no threat to their reputations."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.88,"from the can, into the pint glass

overall its not that bad, good one after a work day!"
Worst,Boris Bold,2.19,"500ml Can

Appearance – Amber colour with an average size frothy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some really good lacing. The head lasted for 5 minutes before it was gone.

Smell – Malts, alcohol, grains/bread

Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, grains and corn. It basically tastes just alike a regular euro-lager but with some added not so well hidden alcohol. Almost like someone added rum/vodka to a beer. It finishes with a boozy grainy aftertaste with a touch of corn syrup sweetness.

Overall – Figured I'd give it a shot.. and basically got what I was expecting.. A harsh tasting beer that I'll never want to drink again."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.98,"500ml can. Stored in the coolers' section of a low-rent liquor store, for some reason...

This beer pours a clear pale golden colour, with two fingers of thin creamy, foamy white head, which leaves some random chunks of lace around the glass as it settles. It smells of sweet corn/rice grain, and mild warming alcohol. The taste is more sweet corn, and strong fusel alcohols, very reminiscent of all those times I didn't huff the mouthwash. The carbonation is fairly moderate, the body medium in weight, somewhat smooth, and cloying. It finishes with a leveling off of the sweetness, right into an abyss of alcohol.

I see now why this was placed where it was - while still beer, it's one big sweet boozy mess."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.97,"A- Copper with little head which immediately receeded.

S- As soon as I opened the can I could smell alcohol and a sweet aroma. Can't really smell much else.

T- Despite the initial pungent alcohol smell the alcohol taste was fairly background. It starts with more of a sweet toffee syrup taste. It's almost sticky. It tasted a bit too sweet for me and there wasn't even the bitter aftertaste that most beers have. It's almost like an alcoholic pop with little carbonation.

M- Felt strange as if it slid off your tongue but held on to everything else.

D- Not a bad drink if you want to get drunk quick. I would never recommend this for anybody aiming to try a tasty beer though. Tasty for a cheap high ABV though. It didn't offend me as much as some people, but at the same time it didn't impress me like others."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.51,"500ml can poured into pint glass june26 2010

T again quite sweet but has a boozy chemical flavor that leaves something to be desired

M a little syrupy and slightly sticky

D just goes downhill as it warms, hard too finish and not something I'll be looking for in the future

this beer would be great if you just want to get smashed and don't want to spend much money, other then that I don't recommend it"
Worst,Boris Bold,1.65,"Pours an orange body, with, contrary to what others have noted, a thin white head that sits around the edge of the glass. Immediately, alcohol attacks the nose, followed by an acidic citrus rind aroma. Some malt in the aroma as well, trailed by faint adjunct and chemicalish wafts. Taste is sweet. Some orange peel, alcohol is very much here. Lots of corn and sickly sweet malt. Finish is cloying, some hops in the aftertaste. Absolutely a malt liquor. I prefer the younger brother of boris bold."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.46,"Woody's doing the CAN-CAN yet again.

An interesting credo was on its can, but despite being of (partially) Alsatian stock, I have many allegiances, especially beer.

Wow, the head looked like the top of a vanilla ice-cream cone! Round, bone-white, good retention. Nice! The color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a grainy sweetness that is characteristic for lagers. The mouthfeel was medium with a metallic overtone underlain with a corn-like sweetness. Finish continued with that same metal/corn combination. Oof."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.39,"Great, I can see already this beer isn't well received. I can't really respect a beer that has glucose syrup added, but I'm sure there are some others out there that I've tried and may have liked. Okay, enough with the rambling, let's try this brew out.

This isn't a terrible looking beer. There is a massive amount of clumpy off white head, and a crystal clear golden body. The carbonation looks almost soda pop. I can't dog this brew's appearance at all.

There is an aroma of husky graininess, with a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight perfumy smell that I find common in euro lagers, especially strong ones.

The taste isn't too off. Very traditional sweetness up front, but an off skunkiness in the middle, with a medicine like taste in the end.

At first this feels refreshing, but then it's ABV is so apparent, it feels like a job to drink this one down to solely get a beer buzz.

I feel I can drink this one down, but wouldn't care for another. This is a gimmick beer marketed to younger folks, who want to get canned."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.3,"Biegaman gave me this one. Thanks? Very clear and gold, this one started with a dense, white cap, but quickly fell to a ring. It produced a bit of streaky lacing too. The aroma was sweet, with grainy malt and some fruity esters. Very low bitterness, mostly sweet with a strong alcohol presence and an acrid finish. Medium/light bodied with a syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. Alcohol was very hot. Not very good and not overly drinkable - I didn't finish my can. It's just an alcohol bomb with little malt or hop depth. I'd be surprised if it isn't made exclusively from extract. Certainly not a good example of a strong euro-lager."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.13,"I have never seen this in the States but I see it in the BeerStores in Ontario all the time. So I am always looking for singles when I am up there and this was one that kept popping up.

Appearance- A little bit on the orange side of brass maybe bronze but not quite. There was hardly any head and NO lace.

Smell- Very weak and a little beany with some yeast.

Taste- Malt liquor like. There is some corn or rice there or both not quite sure which. There is not much of a taste but more of an aftertaste that is kind of gooseberry like.

Mouthfeel. A little of a burn and a little warm going down.

Drinkability- I guess if you dont like good beer it is alright. It will get you drunk."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.68,"Thanks for hooking me up with this biegaman, its a real treat!

Pours a clear golden, big pillowy white head forms, goes pretty fast, no lace. Smell is weird corn, rice, adjuncty, some caramel, citrus, alcohol, touch of vanilla, pretty standard for the style. Taste is the same, although the alcohol is right at the front, bit of graininess, corn, caramel, bit smooth in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, warmth, but not too bad for the style. Thanks Jan!"
Worst,Boris Bold,3.43,"500 ml can. Best before 01/2008.

A- Yellowish head. Good sized head that settles down to a ring but with bubbles that stick to the glass and dissappears after a certain time. Beer is a nice deep gold colour. Little effervescence.

S- Standard beer. Slightly fruity. Average describes it well.

T- Alcohol character prominent. Mild hops. Some good malt notes hidden behind the alcohol. Watery finish. Missing something, not quite sure what.

MF- Clean with decent body. Refreshing.

D- Drinks well, especially considering the alcohol. Loses marks for not offering anything extra to make it seem more interesting. Final analysis is that I like it but am not sure why."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.56,"On the initial pour I was quite hopeful. The beer had a nice golden look to it. The smell however was a strong sweet smell, that made me all too aware of the strength of the beer.

My first sip was that it had a very malty sweet taste that initially I liked. Upon another sip the sweet and malty taste became overpowering, bringing with it a mouthfeel that reminded me of hard liquor. In fact there was a brief moment in which I was reminded of congac. I could almost feel a headache coming and was becoming lightheaded near the end of the glass.

I'm not usually a fan of strong beers and this was no exception. The strong beers that I have liked have usually had a depth of taste that is in the forefront. In this case it is the strong alcohol content that is in the forefront."
Worst,Boris Bold,2.29,"A very sweet and strong beer (I can't emphasize that enough). The smell is almost equally powerfull. There is also a strong taste of malt. It's kind of like Holsten Maibock in overdrive.

I wouldn't recommend this beer for anything else but to get drunk, fast. When it comes to extremely strong beers (9-10%), I would prefer this better being how it is a bit tastier then most."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.26,"500ml can: Poured a semi-dark yellow color beer with large white foamy head with minimal retention. Carbonation seems quite low and the beer has a strong grainy aroma, which I didnt enjoy. Taste is also way too grainy for my taste and this beer resemble more of a malt liquor then a European strong lager. Alcohol is not well hidden which doesnt really matter since this beer ended up being poured in the drain."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.96,"I think the diatribe and picture of a flag waving dude are supposed to represent a hot headed revolutionary or anarchist. This revolution is doomed to failure, and the protesters should be dragged off in chains and flung into the Bastille.
The brew is a heady 8.6% abv, so at least I got a buzz out of it.
The apprearance was acceptable, with a nice deep honey colour, and a half inch head that was gone in 2 minutes. Fine delicate lacing stayed throughout the drink.
Smell was hard to pin down. Yeasty, sour fruit, not like beer should smell.
Taste: Like fermented yeast infection, with overtones of sour old refrigerator leavings.
Mouthfeel: Good fizz that stayed to the bottom of the glass.
Drinkability: I guess I have a stronger constitution than the other reviewers, so I chugged it down and it stayed down. I would drink more if it were the only beer available, if I had some strong cheese or BBQ Doritos, and someone else was buying."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.44,"Oh Boris beer, you and your silly idealist diatribe written on your label. I can't join in and pick up that flag, because it is coated in painfully transparent and slimy marketing department propoganda with no soul or personality.

Ideologies aside, this Boris Strong came in a 500 ml red can, diatribe and all. Pours out a decent looking lager, deep golden, massive carbonation, and a two finger tight creamy white head with nice retention. Even a bit of lacing.

Bready malt and sour grains on the nose, and the start of the slightest hints of cooked veggies lurking in the background. A thankful touch of hops can be discerned through that ether of cooked veg after a while.

Without further ado, the flavour of this stuff is truly awful, repulsive. Sour mash grains, veg and chemicals assualt your mouth and goes down your throat kicking and screaming, swearing to high hell, and vandalising whatever it comes into contact with. So this is Euro malt liquor, huh....

The mouthfeel is thick, heavy and oppressive, it holds its elbows up high.

I've managed to choke down about a third of a glass of this stuff, and I've had enough of it for the rest of my life--sink pour time. It made quite an impression, and I shall avoid this Boris Bold so it cannot become a repeat offender, I've been violated enough."
Worst,Boris Bold,1.71,"Sheesh, what a heavy beer. Feels thick and syrupy in your mouth. Harshly bitter at first sip, slides into a gooey sweetness before finishing off with a blast of alcohol and another bitter parting shot. Leaves a bit of a lingering alcohol burn.

Pours up a nice gold colour with a short head that settles to soap film. Sweet malt noticeable in the nose, along with a whiff of hops and underlying alcohol.

This is an unpleasant beer."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,2.66,Got this in a 24oz can and it was in a cooler at the bottom of all the ice. Drank it directly from the can but poured some into a glass first. Not so bad iced cold. Definitely quenches the thirst or to have with burgers or hot dogs.
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,3,"I love when pompous beer people rate cheap swill in depth, always good for a laugh. Now don't get me wrong, I love beer and I love drinking top quality brews, but theres nothing wrong with slamming cheap strong beer and catching a buzz with your buds. Looks like bubbly piss, stinks like green Apple, taste like nickels in sugar water, but will do the trick, and fast. Tastes like nothing after 3 of them anyway. Drink up and have a good time."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,1.57,"This one poured very bubbly and fizzy at first, and then settled immediately into pond water. The color is a weak and tepid clear straw yellow. There's a lot of lacing.

This smells horrid - wet stale leaves, old bread, metal, solvent, and green apple.

This is absolutely disgusting, and not even worth the $1.99 it cost. It's just super stale, vegetal, and weirdly sweet and bitter all at the same and in all the wrong places. It definitely tastes like it brewed inside of an old work boot and left to ferment in the Death Valley sun.

This is not drinkable, not even in the least, with a weird stale fruity bite on the back end.

This is disgusting and should be drank by absolutely nobody."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,1.46,"Well I'll first say that I had this at a quite warm temperature, so I admit that it's certainly warmer than ideal, however I drink a lot of beer at rather warm temperatures though, and they still can get good ratings.

Anyway, the smell was like a cheap beer: weak ""standard beer"" smell mixed with a bit of damp socks and/or urine. I suppse some corn too, which is maybe a bit different depending on what you think a typical cheap beer smells like.

The pour was very bubbly with a huge head that dissipated extremely quickly and eventually left no head nor lacing at all after some sips, not even around the edges of the glass. (temperature could play a factor in this, but still I don't think I've ever seen a beer that this has happened with)

The color was typical yellow like pee, with big bubbles everywhere like fresh carbonated soda.

The mouthfeel was rather hollow. It had very prickly carbonation like a fresh carbonated soda, but it didn't maintain its power/foam with some swishes.

Taste was metallic (VERY STRONG METALLIC TASTE), ""watery"" (I guess a lack of flavor) and otherwise just plain lacking, or dare I say ""bad"". While there was certainly SOME hops in here, it wasn't especially noticeable, nor was it a kind that tasted particularly good nor interesting in any way to me (just kind of generic bitterness/hopiness?). There wasn't much of maltiness taste to me either, or at least there was a lack of complexity/body to any maltiness that was there. I did quite easily notice multiple times a bit of ""corn"". If you've ever been to a brewery/distillery that uses corn fermentation you should know what I mean, but I suppose even eating fresh corn might give a bit of a similar taste. While senses can sometimes be deceiving/wrong, I believe that this beer must have been fortified with a corn-based low-filtration alcohol, otherwise I don't know why I'd be tasting any corn in this. Am I crazy to say this? I don't know if that's something that's ever done. Heck maybe it's a beer made mostly/exclusively from corn? is that possible? because that's kind of what it tastes like.

I poured it from a 473 ml can (and also drank most straight from the can), which some might say contributed to the metallic taste, but I don't believe in that sort of thing. I don't find that cans affect the flavor in any sort of significant way; especially not to this extent. The last beer I had as a draft from a bar and it tasted very metallic and ""bad"" like this as well, which is an interesting coincidence (it might have been Labatt beer even for all I know, as it was just the house draft). I think the metallic taste is due to the carbonation (carbonic acid), and not being masked enough by any other flavors. Another way to describe it would perhaps be like a mild sodium bicarbonate solution, or club soda. Mix a bit of really cheap low-filtered/unfiltered corn vodka with some club soda and you'd probably be getting close to the taste of what I'm predominately feeling here. Obviously that's a bit of an exaggeration though.


Unsurprisingly the 7% ABV isn't well hidden as it's an extremely prominent ""flavor"" as well. I do like that it has high ABV though, as I've found that I generally do like beers that have higher ABV, which is why I thought I'd give this a shot. However while it is a low price point for relatively high alcohol content, my go-to cheap high-ABV beer is MILES away better than this. Faxe Strong. At least where I live (Canada) Faxe is essentially the same price per ml as this, right around the bottom of what I think the minimum legal price is considering the ABV— or at least around the minimum of what's commercially viable in the country as well considering that they're individually canned and individually sold (although I suppose some are sold in packs as well). I wasn't expecting anything from Faxe Strong, but I was actually surprised at it being very good. It's one of my favorite reasonably-price high ABV-beers, right under most of the stuff that Unibroue produces (although Unibroue comes at a higher price point, still well-priced)

Because of how much I disliked it, or rather how I disliked pretty much every aspect of it, I'm not sure how to even rate this. All I can say is that it's probably worse than anything commercial that I've had before, and is right around the bottom, just probably not worst possible. I'm sure it's possible to scrape lower without getting into non-commercial or spoiled/skunked beers.

I don't know if this is a pro or a con, but I got to ""enjoy"" the beer over a long period of time due to it not being in any way delicious.

So really anywhere between a 1 and a 1.75 (out of 5) seems reasonable to me. The main thing that you take from this is that in most citiess there should be no reason to buy this when there are better alternatives (at least at other stores)"
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,3.53,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 4/20/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/metallic aromas, but not overwhelming; mostly went away as it warmed. Nice an pleasant aromas with bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Increasingly warming 8% alcohol, but not too rough of a finish. Overall this is a pretty good iced malt liquor. All around good robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV; with the mildly bitter/boozy finish. Clean and rich barely/grain flavors with mild earthy hop balance. Not overdone on the corn adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable, and well made style example."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,2.01,"1/13/18: 24 oz can purchased at Shop & Save Market, $1.49 w/ tax. Poured a 24 ounce can over two pours, canned on 11/7/17 into a large flute. Beer is 8.0% ABV, not the 7.1% listed above. Pour clear yellow, soapy cloudy white head which lasted a while. Nominal corn aroma and taste, mild carbonation, very thin mouth feel. Alcohol hidden until you consume the can, very light drinking due to the light taste and thin texture."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,1.55,"I'm sure beer gets worse than this, but I'm blessed that I have only had one that would fall to those murky depths. This is in the bottom 2 worst beers I've ever had, and it's cutting it close. This stuff is awful, don't buy this.

L - Looks kinda off-putting. A yellow, over carbonated pour with some soapy head. Resembles something between fresh urine and mop bucket water. But it's hard to actually fuck this up and it has a head so although it's not a pretty sight, it's not as much of a warning sign as it should be.

S - It's the usual for a beer to rank poorly here because it has no discernible scent characteristics. It's not as usual for it to rank poorly because it actually smells unpleasant. This beer has its standard malty and corny smell, but intertwined with a chemical aroma that just doesn't belong there. It keeps reminding me of cleaner for some reason.

T - I could give the actual account of taste, which is chemical doused corn and alcohol and not much else. But really the way I'd honestly describe it is like drinking regularly bad mass-produced beer, by pouring it on a shirt you've worn for a long time and wringing it out. It's oddly accurate to what you'd imagine, and just as off putting as it should be. Aftertaste lingers for too long, and is a haunting reminder of what just happened.

F - Admittedly the mouthfeel is not horrific. It's actually kinda average. Not that light, little too carbonated, smooth enough, and goes down even if the entire trip is unpleasant. But it's not worth it.

O - If you're not a broke alcoholic, you can be doing better. Hell, even if you are a broke alcoholic you probably can still do better. I refuse to believe that there isn't better options than this. Such as drinking antifreeze or huffing your own excrement."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,1.25,"This is just plain awful, it pours a golden color with a thick white head, I put it in the freezer for a half hour. it leaves little in the way of lacing. There is nothing good here."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,3.62,"(24 oz can at $1.19... chilled then sat out for 20 min... poured into a Chouffe tulip)

L: just about crystal-clear orange-yellow... the foam does take a little extra time fading away, and it does actually lace a lil... I don't know, I'm digging the clarity tonight... now that I'm looking at it, there's a ton of dust floating around - huh?

S: pretty standard... cookie-candy like, syrupy malt... maybe the faintest whiff of sweet orange peel... no hops and only a whisper of spicy booze...

T: dare I say vaguely Belgian yeast and booze notes (industrial strong Belgian blond) up front - it does finish with a mild caramel sweetness and lingering metallic, old lemon peel, and grassy-bitter notes... the malt seems a bit too clean or perhaps muted - maybe that works in its favor?... the finish is a touch watery... dry-grassy, almost burlap flavor builds along the way

F: lighter body with a delicate viscosity... fluffy soft flow... the finish and residual feel is slightly watery, seemingly allowing the metallic taste to stand out more... quite clean and very easy drinking - the booze is there, like soft white noise near the bottom

O: flavor-wise its a notch or two too weak and mildly watery... one of the few 'ice' malt liquors that lives up to its name... all in all I feel it's well made... I could see hittin' this again in the future"
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,4,"Labatt Maximum Ice - Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. Poured from the tall can into a mug, this beer's head is two fingers thick and slightly off-white, with solid lacing, and clear medium-golden body.

I smell a copious amount of earthy grains, and corn. Not too rough for a malt liquor.

Tastes like a decent balance of corn and bright, earthy grains. Nothing overpowering. This certainly is not the worst malt liquor I've had believe that. I digress...

The mouthfeel here is clean and crisp.

I'll choose to give Labatt Maximum Ice - Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. a 4 overall. Again, if one truly rates WITHIN THE STYLE, like we keep appearing to care about, this is quite a decent offering for what it's worth. If you want a malt liquor with more of a true beer taste, give this a try."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,3.16,"Labatt Maximum Ice brewed by Labatt Brewing Company Ltd., with an ABV of 7.1% This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. The smell of Labatt Maximum Ice is strong with grains and malts. You pick up a hit of hops at the end. You can really pick up the alcohol smell of this brew. This brew is what some would call CORN beer, I'm not saying that is a bad thing. So far this brew looks and smells like most ICE brews on the market today. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors . You can pick up on the 7.1% ABV in this brew. There are a lot of grins in this brew. AKA corn. For what it is worth this is an OK drinking brew for the money. This is not your high dollar craft brew. The mouthfeel of Labatt Maximum Ice is rich bold and hard. This is brew you buy when you only want one. There is nothing bad about this brew however it is broader line death in a can, if you drink to many you will black out. Overall I'm giving Labatt Maximum Ice a 3 out 5. Not the best I had but not the worst. I would buy this again. Labatt Brewing Company Ltd., did an OK job with this one."

Worst,Labatt Max Ice,1.2,"I thought I would completely eliminate and re-do this review just so I can tell you guys all about the joys associated with this one. No really, It is so bad that it's almost good.

Look - Ever heard somebody say a beer looks like piss? Well I usually don't see that with adjuncts or malt liquors but for the first time in my beer drinking career I safely say...It looks like piss. Dehydrated see through yellow with a monster 5 five white head of soapy bubbles that pop and have chemicals written all over them. Lacing is not a factor as I will not be drinking enough of it to know.

Smell - Remember when I said chemicals? Well yeah. It smells like something you would use to clean the floor of an industrial site. The corn adjunct it there but it smells like it got a fresh spray from monsanto prior to the canning.

Taste - Industrial hopes and dreams. and chemicals. Corny as all hell and not a manageable corn either. More like a rotten, insect infested stalk dowsed in cleaner.

Feel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. But at least it has something.

Overall - Even if I were to become a hapless, hopeless, homeless alcoholic you could not pay me to drink this stuff. I wouldn't gift this to my worst enemy as I would probably be charged with attempted murder. Even by the standard of Malt Liquors this is a horrendous beer that should be immediately discontinued before somebody dies. I sentence this one to death via firing squad.

I feel violated. this beer needs to go on a taste bud offender website for life."
Worst,Labatt Max Ice,2.11,"473 mL can from the LCBO; served slightly chilled.

Pours a pale golden-yellow colour, topped with one finger of soapy, frothy white head that gradually recedes over the next few minutes. Nice lacing. Looks fine, but my first sniff is enough to warn me what I'm in for - it's super corny, with grainy malt sweetness, cardboard, melted plastic and some ethanol being the only elements of note. Why do I get myself into these situations?

Pretty gross, even for the style. Very sweet, with lots of corn grist, syrup and apple juice. While this brew generally lacks the papery cardboard notes of many cheap, high-diesel lagers, the alcohol is rather poorly hidden - I am only 3-4 sips in and I am already sick of the stuff. The mouthfeel isn't too bad - medium in body, with a smooth, almost creamy nature due to the restrained carbonation levels. There are only two rules with beers like this - drink them fast, and drink them cold. I sort of broke the last rule, but I think I'm man enough to finish the rest of this can, despite the beer's overall unpleasantness.

Final Grade: 2.11, a disappointing D-. I only know one person who drinks this stuff, and it's definitely not because of the nuanced flavour. Labatt Maximum Ice is good for precisely one thing - getting shitfaced on beer while spending as little money as possible. If you're not an alcoholic homeless person, I can't think of any compelling reasons to bother with this one. For the record, I did manage to finish the can, but I won't be picking up another in the future."
Worst,Schmidt,2.52,"This was a beer that I remember from my service days when I was stationed in Texas and Oklahoma. Got it from a friend, along with many other brands, that he picked up for me along the way when he drove up to visit. Beer tasted like I remembered it, not something to get excited about, but it will quench a thirst when you need it."
Worst,Schmidt,2.74,"This rant review is in honor of 1980 NL MVP, Mike Schmidt... How did I see this beer in a variety of locations over the last 10 years, but now on a day when I visit the damn neighborhood where the brewery used to stand, I can't find a single can. They gave the bar at The Fire a new snazzy coat of paint, but no longer do I see Schmidt breweriana on the walls or cans in the their fridge... None of the other joints in the vicinity had it. Shame on you, Garage, with all your canned dreams, to not include a row for dear old Schmidt... I will find you soon, I know I will, and I'll do a proper review, even though I already know what you probably taste like... The above number ratings are based on Schmidt's 1979 stats. I'm sure his namesake beer smells of an 8, but I can't bring myself to give an overall 1... Don't mind me... Just delirious, playing with digits. (1980)"
Worst,Schmidt,2.88,"Pours a crystal-clear straw yellow with a thin short lived white cap. Aroma is corn and biscuity. Flavor follows the nose, when ice cold it's a very modest priced refresher after drinking higher quality beers. I mean to say that there's nothing wrong with saving a few bucks after the taste buds are as buzzed as the rest of you. Feel is crisp and well carbonated. Overall, not a beer to write home about, but now that I'm retired, a cheap beer now and then works for me."
Worst,Schmidt,3,"I remember it being a decent beer for the money on a hot summer day.
The 12-packs had the various sportsmen outdoors fishing and hunting motifs on the cardboard and the cans.
It was an okay beer for the budget-minded (cheap). About 4 bucks a 12-pack back in the '80s.
Definitely a light beer. Ice cold, it's crisp and unassuming with not much of an aftertaste."
Worst,Schmidt,3.09,"A middle-of-the-road adjunct lager. Poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage hollow-stemmed goblet, mainly for looks. A center pour yielded a nice two-finger white head atop a clear pale-yellow body. Decent retention, some nice lacing, and good carbonation. That's about it. Aromas and flavors of corn, grassy hops, and tart cider. Light in body, not much bitterness. A little bit of fruity tartness lingers on the finish. Overall, not much here to offend the taste buds and the olfactory senses."
Worst,Schmidt,4.84,"When I was farming, I grew cereal grains, soybeans, corn, sunflowers and more. Schmidt doesn't taste or smell like corn! When you're combining, storing, augering or hauling barley, you know what it smells like. How many of you have been in the dust; it itches like heck! As a trucker, I hauled malted barley from Moorhead & Shakopee MN to Anhesuser-Busch in Baldwinsville, NY, Houston, TX & Stroh's brewery in N.J. Years ago, I toured Red Hook in Woodinville, WA too; ugh the coffee one was, well like coffee. I've hauled pearled, feed and needles barley. I know breweries and I know barley. I drink Schmidt BECAUSE it has an aftertaste. I drink it because it isn't a water-flavored beer. I slayed the Big Mouth bottles back in the day. I've sent emails to Pabst about bringing the Big Schmidty back, but to no avail. In my ratings, I don't believe in rating the ""Look"" or the ""Feel"", what for? How many of you rate the beer based upon the 2 row or 6 row barley varieties? Is it good in a can, yes; is it good it a bottle, absolutely! How would I change it? I'd add just a little more hops flavor. Love you all, but I love Schmidt more."
Worst,Schmidt,2.68,"From a 12oz can, $4.99 for a 6 pack:

Appearance: Clear yellow, ok head.

Smell: Mild corn.

Taste: Mix of mild sweet corn and a slight sourness. It would be fine but then gives a butyric twinge.

Overall: Continuing a mini-tour of sub-premium lagers, Schmidt used to be made in St. Paul and some signs can still be seen outside dive bars advertising it. My can had a bear on it. Beer wasn't bad, but wasn't too good either, with a weird sour note to it."
Worst,Schmidt,4.11,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The can is a vibrant red with a deer on it. It's a very honest and masculine can. The Schmidt logo would look good as a sticker in the back window of a pickup.

Smell - Light and corny, simple and airy. A classic smell.

Taste - Crisp and refined. Not too sweet, not too earthy. A really nice balanced flavor. Better than a lot of bigger name AALs.

Feel - Thin and still. Could use a bit more pep in its step though.

Overall - I had never heard of or seen this beer before, just bought a case on a whim. It's way better than I expected. It's a simple casual drinker, I could go through a lot of this."

Taste - Fairly light. There's a slight malt sweetness up front, but very slight. Not much else to this beer.
The body is light, as expected. Some carbonation on my palate.
For an AAL, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse. For what it is, it's good. This would be a very good beer to drink on a hot summer day, which I did a lot in my younger days."

Worst,Schmidt,3.56,"Sampled this when in PA a while back. For a while, it was declared a dead beer. Glad it's back. I remember drinking this in my in-laws basement while visiting them in PA. Easy-drinking aal, to my best recollection. My grandmother in law was wondering why the toilet downstairs was flushing so often. I learned to ""bank my pees"" so as not to be too conspicuous."

Worst,Tsingtao Pure Draft,2.92,"Look - golden in color, lots of fizziness that fully dissipates quickly, leaving virtually no lacing.

Taste - sweetness indicating considerable rice, and comes with a light hoppy bite towards the end with a slightly malty finish. its watery, but the flavors are there.
Feel - as light bodied as it can get, high carbonation, and not very boozy (so the 4.8% is probably an overestimate)
Overall - one of the most commonly found beers across China, and the ""pure draft"" is even more popular than the flagship given its refreshingness: people do drink it like water! As such, I have some very fond memories with this beer...score reflects just a little bit of sentimentality."

From the CAN: ""Pure Health""; ""Draft"".

I really debated on just how to open this one. It came with a throwback pop-top like Jimmy Buffett once sang about & just like the modern 360-degree opening CANs, I am less-than-enamored of a piece of metal that CAN become simply one more throwaway. Jeff Lebo showed me how to CANduct a bottom-opening of a modern CAN & I did so, using my late paternal grandfather's extremely pointy letter opener. The initial Glug was more of a dribble, but once it got going, it poured like a champ. In fact, there must have been an air pocket since it suddenly let go & really began flowing! It rose up to create nearly three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head before (thankfully) falling away in the day's heat & humidity. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1- 2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled adjunct-free with a light maltiness and just a kiss of the hops. Rice? Maybe. Corn? Not so as I could tell, at least not on the nose. Mouthfeel was light, airy, watery, about what I have come to expect from Asian Lagers. Par for the course. The taste was lightly malty-sweet with a faint hoppiness, but again, no corn was discernible as an adjunct. It really did not taste too bad at all. I especially liked its lightness on this hot, humid Summer afternoon when it was just nice to cool off with a beer. YMMV."

Worst,Tsingtao Pure Draft,2.91,"Can served to me at Mongolian BBQ in S. Minneapolis

Your average rice adjunct lager right here. Basic, skunky, light, cuts into the spicy/savory flavors well. This has a somewhat better hop presence than others in it's class, but otherwise it's very average, run-of-the-mill stuff

OK with some spicy asian food, otherwise I'll just take a water"
Worst,Tsingtao Pure Draft,1.06,"This is one of the worst beers I've ever had. Pours a light yellow--looks like a bright bud light cut with a little water. Thin bubbly head that immediately disappears. No lacing or retention. Smells like metal, artificial lemons, and straw. Tastes the same way. overcarbonated. This is very much in the style of an american adjunct but even worse than the usual examples."
Worst,Light Beer,2.43,"First off I don't like any light beers. I'm a Guinness Stout guy. However, I'll concede there's times when a heavier brew isn't the thirst quencher of choice. Like when the temp soars in the nineties and you would just about drink water as your preferred thirst quencher. That's is a time for light beer and this ones is about as un-offensive as it gets. It reminds me of Keystone for those times....at an even better price. It's really light tasting. Not too much adjunct taste or hops bitterness. It really quinces a thirst. It's easy to drink period. For a basement priced brew for those who want to quaff it down this stuff rules. I think it gets no love first because of the segment and second because of the price. Really? What are we reviewing here. For the segment it competes in, and at the price it goes for, this is a singularly good product. I know it's like the third or whatever generation of Kirklands offerings in the light beer segment. I think it's good enough that they should settle on this on and offer it indefinitely."
Worst,Light Beer,2.6,"I’ve rated every quality of this low, and yet the overall score is a 3.5. Why? Because for a measly $22, you can get 48 of these bad boys. 48. At least where I live, you’ll pay 21 for 24 coors, an equally shitty beer in my opinion. For its purpose, you won’t find a better deal, and that’s its appeal. Yellow color, hardly any taste, no head, yet $44 will get an entire college party popping. You know what you’re getting, and to the end this is great."
Worst,Light Beer,2.68,"A: Pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights. The beer has a finger tall fizzy bright white head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of grainy malts with moderate amounts of corn adjunct sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops.

T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with moderate amounts of rice + corn adjuncts along with a light amount of corn sweetness. That is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness.

M: Light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp.

O: While not a style that I generally seek out, this beer was not offensive like some of the other budget offerings in the style. Easy to drink with a crisp, light mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol. I would not go out of my way to seek this out again but I was pleasant surprised.

Note: This was received in thanks from a total stranger in the Costco parking lot for helping him to load a couple of Adirondack chairs into his vehicle."
Worst,Light Beer,1.44,"Oof, you have no idea how badly I wanted this beer to be good. At about 40 cents per can I had the highest hopes for this beer to be a crisp and refreshing one. Instead, I am greeted on the nose with an oddly sweet and undeniably moscato-like smell. The taste retains this sweetness, but brings in quite a bit of funk as well. This beer is just too flavorful to be a beer for getting drunk with nothing to enjoy about it in the first place. Very bad beer"
Worst,Light Beer,2.7,"When I drink light beer, I usually drink Miller Lite. It's not like it has a great flavor-- it's just what I drink when it goes on sale at Rite Aid for under a buck a can. When I saw this at Costco for .50 a can, I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, it's not really as good as Miller Lite. You know how in restaurants, when you order a soda water, they bring it to you with a slice of lime? This beer tastes exactly like that. A lime citrus taste. It's not unpleasant and is probably really nice on a hot day after hours of back-breaking work. It has the same alcohol content as Miller Lite at half the price, but double the carbs and half the taste."
Worst,Light Beer,1.92,"This is an alright college beer that I wouldn't recommend you buy.

You absolutely cannot beat the price for these, but they taste worse than pretty much any light or ice beer I've ever had.

Stick with PBR."
Worst,Light Beer,2.67,Well it is Christmas time and travels with family. Figured I needed to try this. Very similar to a Busch light. Where was this in college at $21 for 48 beers!?!?
Worst,Light Beer,1.06,"The alcohol content is lower than any beer I have ever purchased personally but, the most important thing to comment on is the subpar, disgustingly flat taste in this fermented water. The taste or headache isn't quite as bad as Bud Light but it gets close. I just find it disappointing that such a large company would choose such a low grade beer to put their label on. If it was closer in taste to, say, Pabst Blue Ribbon, or even as low as Coors Light, I'd give 5 stars across board but it's not even close. On the plus side, the price for the quantity is unbeatable and I will most likely continue to purchase this beer and it's hangovers because of this, as well as how good the company treats its customers."
Worst,Light Beer,2.03,"This is my favorite light lager. It has a mildly enjoyable caramel flavor but no head retention, smell, or real body. Regardless of price point, it's better than Bud Light, Coors Light, etc. Considering the price point, WOW! My buddy and I went to Costco the other day and saw these. $9.97 for 48. Yep, we did a double take too, and then we bought three. What a deal."
Worst,Light Beer,2.71,"Clear pale golden color with a head that disappears instantly. Tastes of sweet malt and nothing else. Actually not terrible for the type, but not anything I'd drink again."
Worst,Light Beer,4.32,"Honestly guys, I just had this beer for the first time and I love it. I'm going to pour it in a glass for my friend on super bowl Sunday, he only drinks bud light. I'm anxious to see what he thinks. When comparing it to other light beers, it beats the usuals like keystone, miller, coors light, ultra, etc. I'm usually a cold bud light or just above freezing pabst guy when I just finished a day of hard labor in the heat of Arizona. Let me say this, $22 for 48 beers and have it taste good to boot? I'm definitely adding this beer to the rotation. Craft guys will not be able to appreciate this beer...don't waste your time if you like high priced light beer. This beer serves a purpose and is a great value."
Worst,Light Beer,2.41,"12oz can, best before 04/26/17, served in a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Clear pale straw color. Initial thin white head died back to nothing. No head remaining, no lacing.

Smell: Very little smell. A bit of cooked veggie with a deep inhale.

Taste: Grainy, hint of mineral, light bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Fizzy, thin.

Overall / Drinkability: Not good. I could have finished it but really didn't want to so I didn't since life is too short for bad beer. This one was not off in any way, just not well crafted. Maybe with the right food I could have finished it, but by itself there is just nothing to it worth really enjoying."
Worst,Light Beer,3.4,Made me look and smell GREAT for 3 days straight. My fiance says I didn't taste so good so I had to give a 1. Feelings......oh the feelings were just unreal. Overall it's nothing short of a PHENOMENAL product. I have 2 JOEs that would agree. Def going to win some awards....I mean the gas exchange after 7 days post drinking are worthy of awards.....def not the beer!
Worst,Light Beer,2.92,"12 oz. can:

Pours clear bright straw yellow. A thin white head descends to a ring leaving little lacing.

The smell is faint grain with a touch of husk. Clean.

The taste is of a typical cheap light adjunct lager, though there is a touch of soap mixed in. A bit of an odd aftertaste, which fortunately doesn't last.

It is fizzy and light, but no more than typical for the style.

It's pretty much a run-of-the-mill generic light cheap lager. Fortunately, I didn't pay for it. Got a couple of cans for free from a neighbor. It's not terrible, but not good either,"
Worst,Light Beer,2.47,This beer is exactly what's it's suppose to be. It's a light beer that outcompetes all other light beers in pricing that taste similar. Kirkland has succeeded .
Worst,Light Beer,3.4,"All about Quantity, not quality. 48 beers for less for $22 = Less than .50 a beer. I would choose this over any of the other light beers produced by the mega breweries. Perfect beer after cutting the grass in the hot steamy Florida summer. If you are even a boarderline beer snob dont bother. But if you need alot of beer or just want to stock the fridge give it a shot."
Worst,Light Beer,2.27,"Usually Kirkland alcohol is good. This is not. It tastes like they left hops and other important ingredients out. This will be going back to Costco.

I don't really care for the taste, but at least it has a taste to it. Most light beers have virtually no taste, so Kirkland comes on on top of them by default. Are there any good light or low alcohol beers that will satisfy someone who likes quality beer?"
Worst,Light Beer,2.94,"Tastes better than bud light, is as light as coors light. It does it's intended purpose, which can agree this is one of those stock beers for when you are needing quantity not quality. Definitely a camping beer, hands down. Float with this one, K-light will help you out."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3.63,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into a pils glass

On the pour a 2 finger head that pokes out of the top of the glass forms then slowly recedes to a rocky slightly fizzy head then to just a covering over thentop after 10 or so minutes. Body is a light golden straw with a very light chill haze.

Aroma is incredibly light and very clean. Based off the aroma alone and the inclusion of rice as the only adjunct I disagree with the current AAL classification and believe this is much closer to a Japanese Rice Lager. Light hops are present and a very light but clean lager yeast note. Malts are quite light and what is there is rice crackery.

Taste is very similar to the smell again very light, but insanely clean and detectably hoppy. Everything about this is light but the hops are floral and fruity woth almost zero bitterness and the yeast notes are light dry and again vaguely fruity. The finish is where the malt comes in and it is very light and crackery with rice lightness present, but the rice itself doesn't contribute much to the flavor. Once the beer warms a bit there is a bit of a dirty lager finish but it takes a while for it to set in and doesn't cover the good parts of this beer.

Feel is light and very dry with a decent carbonation bite. Very refreshing and drinkable but the mouthfeel is incredibly dry. Not the softest beer in the mouth, a bit of a fizzy feeling. Finish Is medium long but clean.

Overall this is an impressive Asian beer. More than just another boring pale lager, it has some defining features, and a nice floral hoppy note. Very dry and surprisingly good. I only got it because I kept seeing it at total beverage and the can looked nice but this is actually impressive and memorable."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.69,"never seen this before in the states until today, dubbed ""classic"" now, its a fine asian brew, fuller bodied and slightly sweeter than most, but also mysteriously and thankfully missing the yucky parts of most of these, no metal, no corn, no adjunct cheapness, and while its not all that good, its also not all that bad, and thats at least as valid in this style range, especially from this part of the world, where our american standards really do not apply in the same way, and i am thankful to be trying this, especially with a heady vegan curry burrito, you never know what you are going to find out there. simple stuff here, international lager type, but slightly big, malt liquor-esque to me, a little adjuncty, but not as offensive as so many, and in this category i think its decent. it cuts spice, its not objectively cheap, and there is great carbonation here. that said, i wouldnt choose this even over a basic available lager type here, molson canadian, labatt blue, heck even high life wins here, but its shooting its shot and i dont hate it, smells and tastes like the can, but whatever, its fun, especially in this food context. always been an international yellow beer nerd, and here is another one, life is good!"
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.42,".5l bottle from Fu Bonn Market. Medium golden, clear, initial foamy head. Heads fades to small cap. Grainy aroma, adjunct grains, cooked vegetables. Taste is sweet and grainy, light vegetal notes. Creamy feel. Drinkable."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3.01,"Import adjunct lager. The first one went down pleasantly, but i tried pouring the second into a glass; better experience chugging cold out of the can. Pale, pale yellow in color with decent head and lacing for the style. Cereal grain is the first scent I pick up, with hints of old world hops plus something musty in the back. Very thin feel to the 4.5%. Finishes cold and fizzy albeit on the watery side. Grainy notes persist. Better in the can for certain as the less desirable mustiness is less noticeable."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3.13,"Look - golden color, transparent, small head that dissipates, leaving virtually no lacing.
Smell - syrupy sweetness, with some malts and rice fragrance. no skunkiness, and actually quite pleasant overall.
Taste - unfortunately, the taste did not make up for the smell. fairly watery, no hops presence, and light malty flavor. finishes with slight sweetness, a strong indicator of the proportion of rice used in this brew.
Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, on par with most adjuncts at 4.5% ABV.
Overall - an adjunct that is quite pleasant on the smell but standard on the taste. nothing atrocious, but nothing amazing either."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3,"Purchased in a NC grocery and poured from a 12oz can.
A- Nice, light-golden pour with a 1 finger head that vanishes. Continually working carbonation.
S- An appealing nose: clean, sweet malts, straw and a little citrus.
T- Nothing special, but certainly not a bad beer. Sweet malts (ponlai rice, I assume, responsible for the sweetness), but pretty clean (not corn syrup and not vegetal like nasty Stateside macros). Some straw and something passing for a very light lemon/citrus finish on the tongue. Straight at you BEER. Crisp and refreshing.
M- Well-carbonated, just short of zippy. Not pasty. Not syrupy. Again the word 'clean'.
O- Again, offering nothing special. But definitely a decent lager for this palate.
Not exactly comfortable looking at down the pipe 3's, but it's an honest and fair evaluation from these beer senses."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.97,"Not THAT bad that you would suppose after sering the ratings. It has a slight sweetness to it that is not annoying so the beer remains drinkable. Though a weak lager, it was okay with Taiwanese food."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,1.08,"I poured this straight in like the brewer suggested but it’s very hard to drink. Smells like airplane glue. Taste even worse. Like drinking a bowl of rice. This may be the most popular beer in Taiwan, but what other beer choices do they have? The low scores are very appropriate for this beer. Nothing I would want to drink again."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,4.74,"Taiwan Beer Classic has a thick, mousse white head, a golden, clear appearance, with lots of powdery sediment and moderate class lacing. The aroma is of sweet biscuit and straw, and the flavor is similar, with grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, and Taiwan Beer Classic finishes crisp and refreshing.

RJT"
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3.61,"Decanted from a 10.14 oz (300 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information, but serial no. 2715 B1.
A: Pours a clear straw to golden color, with a half inch head, little retention and no lacing.
S: Aroma of bread crust and pepper.
T: Tastes malty vis a vis bread as well. Really resembles a Dortmunder. Very little, but peppery bitterness.
M: Light bodied, low carbonation, crisp finish.
O: Taiwan was a pretty solid adjunct lager. Like most internationals and adjuncts, it get very low scores on this Website. This bottle was not skunked; do not rate it, if it is. Different from what we are used to in the States, but drinkable and enjoyable."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.83,"From a 1 pint 4 oz bottle. Pours a straw color with a lacing of white bubbles. Slightly sweet skunky smell. Light, crisp, carbonated feel. Not much flavor, maybe very light pilsener with a touch of grass. Overall, it's clean, crisp, and inoffensive. Not bad, but not very distinctive either."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.69,"From 1 pint, 4.2 ounce bottle to glass
deep amber hue, medium foam, clear
Smell: not a lot of aroma
better tasting than the gold, low bitterness
carbonation comes out
good beer: not to repeat, look for
drank: January 24, 2017 10:03 PM"
Worst,Taiwan Beer,3.08,"Bottle in trade from Solidfunk, thanks for the country! Slightly hazy light golden color with a thin wisp of a white head. Light skunk, pilsner and a touch of floral earth and faint metal. Better than I expected really."
Worst,Taiwan Beer,2.78,"355ml can poured into pint glass 17/2/16

A clear straw yellow with some giant bubbles feeding a very short lived finger of foam that leaves no lace

S rice cakes, wet paper, soggy hay, has a macro thing going for it that's fairly typical but not overly offensive

T more of the same really, some green apple added top the mix

M thin and watery, bubbles fluff it up and it flattens out instantly, strange wet paper with apple sauce finish

O reminds me of the big American macros, cheap malt pumps out what you paid for, not awful but nothing good either

like so many before it this is a one and done, a country tic and not a whole lot more"
Worst,Carling Lager,2.74,"I buy this in summer and keep in the fridge at our cottage. Good to drink instead of water and to serve in quantity to my kids. Not horrible and usually one of the cheaper brands. Always available at the store. A go to for summer, hot days when we can chill outside on a hot day."
Worst,Carling Lager,3.68,"I guess people are rating the beer poorly because it's not a style they like. They really did nail the style except the nose may have been a little too grainy. Also, the beer was right up against expiration and had a slight oxidation taint."
Worst,Carling Lager,3.18,"Completely solid Canadian style adjunct. I've written about this in the past, and I think that Canadian adjuncts should be considered the own sub-category, although I'm far too illiterate to explain what exactly that would entail. I do know, however, that the majority of Canadian adjuncts I've had that aren't sold stateside (Molson Export, Labatt 50, etc) have a richer flavor and creamier body than most American adjuncts, with even loss hop presence than their American counterparts and a warmer embrace of cereal nodes.

This is a good example of the style, though not as good as Labatt 50 or Molson Ex. Firm cereal start, crisp and lightly sour middle, light finish with a creamy body throughout.

I don't know where this falls into the (sub/super)-Premium tier of the Ontario beer market, or if such a tiering system even exists outside of the US, but I'd say this would compete well against the Pabst/Bud/Coors segment of the American market. If you absolutely despise macros, then of course you wouldn't like this (and I don't see why you'd bother to rate it)."
Worst,Carling Lager,3.55,Solid adjunct. Crisp and refreshing. A bit more tart overall than the usual adjunct parade. Decent mouthfeel/body. Smell is pure roasted corn. Great citrusy aftertaste. Again -- nothing special -- but decent enough to go into the rotation.
Worst,Carling Lager,1.3,"DO NOT BUY THIS BEER.
I bought a pack of 6 cans. The price is really interesting. I think Molson is trying to get some sell on the economic beer. But they totally screw it up.
Like is undrinkable. I had 3 beers and I could hold it. Even trying to drink 1 beer a day of this was impossible. I had to put the 3 other cans in the garbage. I don t know how people drink that beer
If u are on a budget and u don t have a lots of money to spend please go buy a Pabst but not this one."
Worst,Red Stripe Light,2.91,Drank for 7 straight days in Jamaica. Perfect abv and feel for the setting. The resort also had Miller lite (which I do not drink often). I did a side by side between the two while floating on a raft in the Caribbean. The red stripe light was superior to the Miller light in terms of smell taste and feel. More hop presence and a nice bready backbone. I’ll probably never drink it outside of my occasional trips to the island. By for 7 days it did me well.
Worst,Red Stripe Light,2.42,"$1 single from the aforementioned gas station. Usually don't buy light lagers under any circumstance buttttt gotta try em all.

Pours a dehydrated piss yellow with a large bone white head as expected. Carbonation is heavy, lacing is pretty decent at the end of the swill.

Smells like your typical light lager though red stripe has also been far more corn forward in my opinion

Taste follows suit. Super corny with a mildy bitter lime presence for whatever reason.

Feel is light and watery as you'd expect but it swallows easy and luckily it has no skunk.

Overall I assume this was $1 because it was old and didn't sell or perhaps others from the pack had broken. Dunno but for $1 there isn't much to complain about. There are better adjunct lagers out there."
Worst,Red Stripe Light,3.36,Had a few everyday for six straight days wile on my honeymoon in Jamaica. Very light yellow color when poured. Very light in the mouthfeel. Very easy to drink and with the 3.6abv it was perfect to sip on all day and I will be drinking again if I make it back to Jamaica.
Worst,Red Stripe Light,4,"Red Stripe Light brewed by Desnoes & Geddes Limited, with an ABV of 3.60% This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a small white head. The smell is sweet with grains, malts, and hit of hops. Red Stripe Light has a nice light clean taste. You pick up on grains and malts. The is a nice sweetness in the taste of this brew. The mouthfeel is nice, clean and relishing. There is nothing bad about this brew. Red Stripe Light has a nice balance to it. Desnoes & Geddes Limited did a nice job with this brew. I would buy this brew again. Overall I'm giving Red Stripe Light a solid 4 out 5. Nothing to write home about, but nothing bad. This is a nice drinking brew.



I would buy this brew again ggggllllooooddddd"
Worst,Kokanee,2.75,"One of the better pale lagers I’ve tried, cereal in nature, but smooth and mild, and tastes really good. Surprised, but pleasantly so. Cereal grains mainly in aroma and taste, Mouthfeel is light, but not watery. Refreshing, and easy to drink."
Worst,Kokanee,3.26,"340mL bottle
wow! I haven’t had this one in about 20 years!
L: crystal clear pale golden body, fizzy white head fades to a thin layer of foam
S: light biscuity grain, grassy hops
T: taste of nostalgia! lightly toasted grain, cereal grain, honey, mild grassy hops
F: light bodied, moderate carbonation, crisp and not overly sweet finish
O: to me a 4 and higher means I’d buy it again…based on nostalgic value this is easily a 4 for me"
Worst,Kokanee,2.82,"Six pack of pint cans picked up at Total Wine in Bellevue, Washington.
No dating, just a code. Served in a pint glass.

Look- Clear watery gold hay color. A decent off-white head that recedes quickly to a thin cap of foam, almost no lacing. moderate carbonation streams visible.

Smell- Corn and light cereal grain, light grass, no real hop aroma.

Taste- Same as the smell, really watered down and mundane.

Feel- Light bodied with a decent, somewhat crisp, lightly corn sweet finish. Medium carbonation on the tongue.

O- I used to drink this years ago and it's really gone down hill. Don't bother with this one, waste of money."
Worst,Kokanee,2.53,"We drink alot of this in canada and its a constant head of debate weither kokannee or bud light is better. The honest truth is theyre both trash, but theyre easy drinkin. Theres only one way to drink kokanee and thats ice fucking cold straight out of some ice and fast enough she dont warm up. If you drive a lifted truck and you dont drink kokanee or bud light, what are you even doing. Kokanee is the pepsi of the beer world and everyone knows it."
Worst,Kokanee,3.79,"Clear gold with three fingers of white head.
Smell is fruity and grainy.
Taste is grainy with some light hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation.
Overall a tasty and light easy drinking lager."
Worst,Kokanee,2.89,"Clear, golden body; lively carbonation; fair one-finger thick head; sheets of foam left along the glass. Cracker-like aroma. The taste mimics the aroma with some additional light hop presence; a bit of metallic flavor at the end. Light body; crisp with a hint of sweetness.

A passable if definitely blasé beer."
Worst,Kokanee,1.29,"An absolute mess and travesty.
Regardless of being Canadian beer it goes down like water, (probably tastes better on tap [if you can find it on tap]).
There is absolutely no feel to this beer, I'm extremely interested into how the hell this sells; perhaps an acquired taste of garbage is required.
A disheveled beer that isn't worth anyone's pallet."
Worst,Kokanee,2.83,"From notes taken 01/22/17:

The quintessential clear straw-gold with foamy bright white head, lower retention. Weakest beer aroma I have yet to encounter, to my recollection. A little bread, grass, lemon, honey, almost too weak to say. That’s okay, weak certainly beats unpleasant. Palate, though considerably more tart, isn’t much different, fairly weak though I’ve had weaker, but not altogether unpleasant in spite of its lack of character. Bready aftertaste might be the best thing about this beer. Light-bodied but approaching medium, extra sudsy, each sip seems about 75% CO2."
Worst,Kokanee,2.43,"Fizzy yellow pour, average lace, head. Retention was blah. Aroma was that canned food smell with a light sprinkling of corn syrup.

Bland taste. Lots of water and fractional sugars. Still kinda expensive when you find it anymore. Its Canadian AAL beer. And it delivers on that end, it is what it is."
Worst,Kokanee,2.77,"There was a time when Kokanee was a great prize for those who
Lived in Alberta. Before Labatt purchased the brewery, this was a much better product. Today, there is not much to separate It from the rest of the mass-produced Canadian lagers."
Worst,Kokanee,3.86,"Served from a bottle. Dark yellow and translucent. Decent head. Minor hop aroma, more cereal grain. Good lager taste, good mix of hop and grain. More on the grain side. Thin mouthfeel."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,4.57,I grew up in PA. Where this was brewed just outside of Pittsburgh. It seemingly always had a loyal following. A very easy drinking beer. Pours a lite straw color. The aroma is light in hops. Initial taste is light bodied with a subtle taste of sweetness. Poured into a 12 ounce glass it has a nice pillow like head that stays a little longer than normal showing good carbonation. Laces along the glass after the head goes away again nice carbonation. Over all a nice easy drinking beer for when you're having more than one.
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.38,Nice color and foam. Tastes like a lite beer but sadly has the calories of a regular one. Still I like it. Reminds me of old times. An unassuming classic that is still around.
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.59,"Saw this at that beer store and remembered drinking this one years ago. Thought I would get it for old-time sake.

Pours a very light clear, pale-ale yellow color and a small white head. The taste is of a light ale. Not bad when it's chilled really good."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2,"Pours apple yellow, no head no lacing, I think it a glass if urine might be as appealing. Nose was grassy hops and corn. Not much flavor to this, it was thin and watery, no carbonation. I wasn't expecting much and I got less than I thought, this was probably the worst beer I've had that didn't include the word ""light or lite""."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2,"Cool bottle, weak fluid inside. American macro swill, just slightly more tasty than water. Was available in Norway 20 years ago, I haven't missed it since."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.32,"LOOK: clear yellow. ¼ finger of foam on top, looks a lot like urine in a glass lol
SMELL: corn and malt
TASTE: like water. C’mon, man. You’re looking at a review of Rolling Rock.
FEEL: lightly carbonated.
OVERALL: My cheap beer of choice."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.65,"I'm on a mission to find something to dethrone PBR in the AAL category, and this comes darn close. Really nothing offensive about the aroma, flavor, finish, or aftertaste. It's in the running. Not at all disappointed I needed to buy 6x16oz to find out. They were enjoyed."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.22,"Poured into a pint glass out of the 25oz ""one extra oz"" can

On the pour a 2 finger head forms then gets rocky and disappears within a couple minutes leaving only a ring around the glass. Lively carbonation and a yellow golden straw color. Cheap Light ""full flavor"" lager.

Aroma is better than a lot of domestics in the glass to be honest. No skunk or lager grossness. Some diacetyl however, and a corny malty note. Decent for the style but not blowing any socks off.

Flavor follows the aroma with a lightness throughout the whole thing carrying the beer flavor of it but the barley/corn flavor is more pronounced, but in a dry crisp actually malty way if that makes sense. It isn't syrupy sweet, and is actually refreshing to put down. Not as light as a ""light"" American beer, but going against all light colored lagers out there, this is pretty light in flavor. Light diacetyl once again, carried in the aftertaste.

Feel is actually solid light to medium body with a decent malty evolution. Not watery, but doesn't overstay its welcome. Good refresher.

Overall I don't understand all the hate on this beer. There's nothing innately wrong with it, it's cheap, and arguably better than most AALs out there. Not hoppy at all but the malt has actual character and the off flavors are forgivable and not some travesty of beer handling."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.51,"Skunky, funky, but not in the barnyard way. It’s very bland, warms up too quickly, and gave me a headache after drinking. I see how I managed to go decades between trying this one out."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.41,"It’s a decent enough light lager. Been years since I last had it. My dad used to keep the Rock cans in fridge. I remember as a boy. Nostalgia. Probably won’t buy it again but 18 bucks for a 30 pack, perfect score for this beer run. No bitter aftertaste. Not a lot of flavor. I would prefer Coors banquet or Modelo. MHL or Bud might even be better. Or Tecate. PBR for sure. Those are my next purchases. Still trying to find my house beer. The Rock ain’t it.

This beer is best drunken straight from a can. Don’t pour it into a glass. It loses its character."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,1.8,"Tastes like the can since it has no flavor profile of its own. Pours a very light yellow, doesn't taste much like beer at all. Leaves you feeling all sticky inside like a lot of macro cheap brews. It tastes like the spit of someone who has been drinking beer, not that I have experience doing that. It's just what comes to mind because it's so light. If you have Hamm's in your area, get that instead. They're about the same price, but Hamm's tastes like beer."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,3.68,"I first started drinking RR in my younger days, it was cheap, good if it was real cold, and easy to drink. That still stands true today. Sometimes while fixing a big breakfast I'll put a RR in the freezer for 15-20 min. then get it out and drink it with my meal(out of a chilled glass of course). I do like the taste, not bitter or over hoppy like some beers and at times it reminds me of my younger days."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.95,"25 oz CAN cost 2 bucks, poured into das boot for fun on a football Friday, after raking leaves and lighting fires. Last time I had this was back in the 80's and 90's while pipelining 80 hour weeks in western PA summers. A hot muggy physical job.
It's very pale like Bud light, and head is gone in a flash, smells pretty decent and unique pleasing grassy ""fresh"" like a fabric softener sheet.
Taste is light and much better than Bud Light, finish is clean and no syrupy stickiness . Pretty good cheap beer for chugging fast, if it's ice cold and from a CAN. Better than I thought it would be"
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.75,"The first case of beer I ever drank with friends back when I was a young buck. Many have come since, but this one will always hold a special place in my heart. In reality, it sucks and I'm biased."
Worst,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,2.64,"This beer has tasting notes of crayons, and weird malt. My dad buys it because we can get a 18 pack of cans for $11.99 COLD in NE Philadelphia. Approx .72¢ a can, American Adjunct Pale Ale with glass lines tanks to keep the metal out. This beer is old man beer, This reminds me of people to go down the park and fish, they have rolling rock, Stroh's and Schlitz beer. This beer is for people old enough to remember when Somerset county Pennsylvania had hired three generations of Brewery workers. Then one day it was sold, and those people got the boot. To this day I will not buy this beer or Breyer's Ice cream (the messed with Philly did same thing too). For Pete's sake please find a different beer to drink."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.06,"Nov. 2010: 330 ml bottle, brewed by Eschweger, ABV in Norway is 4.7%. Bought at MENY Stadionparken. Crystal clear extremely pale yellow colour, big white head. Grainy aroma of unhopped pilsener wort and boiled vegetables, not good. Sweet and sugary flavour, hardly any bitterness. What a stupid idea - brewing a purposely shitty American Standard pale lager in Europe, just because Homer Simpson would have liked it ... Taste is nothing, marketing is everything."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.85,"Brewed in Germany, so must adhere to the purity law one would imagine.

I thought this stuff would be terrible as it is obviously a gimmick, however I was pleasantly surpisred. The beer is okay with half decent flavour, nothing to write home about though.

The packaging states that the beer is a Lagerbier Hell, which would suggest it is a Munich Helles style beer."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.35,"330ml Can from a Prague Mini-Market (59CZK):
Clear, light amber with a large, foamy head that is bone-white and holds okay initially before holding at 0.5cm.

Grassy hops & some skunk on the nose initially. There was a very light & faint citrus aroma coming through with more water than I would have expected or liked, there was some bitterness too.

Basic and fairly cheap (despite the cost) pale lager with some light malts and grassy hops with some earthy tones and a hint of biscuit. There wasn't a lot going on really.

Light to thin bodied with a watery, quite bland feel but it still felt like a lager at least, albeit a light one. There was a faint citrus tang & a dry, moderately bitter finish as well.

Not all that enjoyable & purely a gimmick, not up to the standard of the much cheaper, & better Czech lagers that were for sale in the same shops as this one. The beer was thin & bland with nothing going for it really."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.82,"A 330ml can with a BB of March 2014. ABV is stated as 4.7%. Given to me as a gift a little while back (from Switzerland). It's Duff - how can I resist trying it?

Poured into a pilsner glass. A clear golden colour with faint sediment and medium carbonation. Forms a decent head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before disappearing. Some lacing. A subtle aroma of light, grainy malt with mild hints of stewed leaves and DMS. Slightly sweet and seriously bland.

Tastes of ultra-light malt with a crisp, dry finish. Notes of weak grain, mild stewed leaves and a twinge of cardboard in the background. Pretty clean, with a delicate bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with effervescent carbonation and a watery body. A very subtle aftertaste of light malt and stewed leaves/veg.

Not too much going on here, which I guess was to be expected. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are exceptionally bland and watery. Average body for a mass-produced lager. At least it's clean and inoffensive. Nothing technically wrong with it, but the lack of character makes for a dull drinking experience. No need to hunt it down."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,4.14,"My neighbor and occasional trivia teammate travels for work on an infrequent basis, but he is always on the lookout for new CANs for me in furtherance of The CANQuest (TM). This is one of his recent acquisitions and I am quite excited about it!

I was hanging out in the alleyway with some of my neighbors, including Hank Hill, Boomhauer, Dale and Bill, drinking CANned Lone Star as is our usual wont when Dale mentions that one of his bowling league partners is coming by with beer. I was stunned when the guy's wife, sporting a huge, blue beehive, droped him off! He looked like That Yellow Bastard from ""Sin City"" and given his prodigious beer intake, I still wonder if he doesn't suffer from jaundice. His name was Homer and he had a huge cooler full of CANs of Duff Beer, which I heard was legendary, but I had never had any for myself. He was cool with allowing me to take one home for a review, especially after I turned him onto a Brewer's Art Ozzy in a CAN. We only ever drink CANs in the alley as the possibility of broken glass is not on in our circle.

I went with an inverted Glug following the Crack and got two-plus fingers of fizzing, foamy eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a golden-yellow (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity and my other drinking buds, Croesus, Mammon and King Midas were engaged in a fight to try some for themselves. Nose was clean, eliminating the possibility of it being an adjunct lager of any stripe. The nose had a hay field-like scent, intermingling the Noble hops with the malt nicely. Mouthfeel was medium and I got a pleasant, biscuity sweetness in the mouth and on the tongue. This was turning out to be much better than I would have imagined. I thought that it was going to be some crappy novelty but such was not the case, thank goodness. Finish was semi-dry thanks to their having found a good balance with the hops and malt and not allowing the malt to dominate as some examples of the style have, IMHO. I would drink it again, especially if that Homer guy shows up loaded for bear like he did today."
Worst,The Legendary Duff Beer,2.26,"Appearance: It pours a clear straw body with a two-finger head. It looks okay and the retention is better than expected.

Smell: A sweet malt and corn aroma are noticeable. It is missing the floral notes found in a good pilsener. To be honest, there really is not much of a smell to it.

Taste: A sweet malt flavor and the tiniest kick of hops can be detected. Otherwise there is not much to note.

Mouth feel: It is light bodied and watery. There is a slight dryness in the aftertaste but more is desired.

Overall: Like most people, I purchased this beer just for the novelty of it. Surprisingly, it was better than I expected. While a poor example of a German Pilsener, there really is nothing overly offensive about this beer. I was expecting a more medicinal grain alcohol flavor but none of that was apparent. In fact, it was probably one of the most neutral beers I've ever had. I probably would not buy it again but I have certainly had worse."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.5,"I bought a 24oz can for 1.29$ because I was on a budget. It doesn't have much in the sense of appearance or smell. Hell, even the can art is bland. It's not bad taste-wise. I was kind of expecting it to be kind of appalling like many ""Ice"" beers but I have to admit, this is one of the better ones. Having said that, it's still way down there in comparison to the 1,000+ beers I've had."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.96,"12 ounce can poured into a nonic tumbler.

L---Medium white head with minimal retention. Left decent lacing, though. The beer is a crystal clear medium gold color.

S---Sweet maltiness. Corn is the primary aroma.

T---Taste follows the nose...sweet maltiness and corn. No real hop bite/snap. More flavorful than the top selling AALs like Coors Light/Bud Light/Budweiser.

F---A little bit syrupy. Well carbonated.

O---This one is a bargain at $14.95 for a 30 pack in PA."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,1.96,"Giant poor alcoholic's edition can, 24 oz, poured into a rather inappropriate Dogfish Head nonic glass.

Has a relatively clear straw blonde body with a surprisingly abiding head of 2 fingers. Nice lacing, too.

Aroma of lottery tickets and wet towels, urinal cakes, corn, general maltiness.

Flavor is full of flaws, I mean wow, I haven't had an unclean beer like this in awhile. Corn flakes doused in bleach, followed by oysters, saltines, and wet leaves.

Feel is crisp but not clean, rather starchy on the palate, with some actual alcohol heat for 5.5%.

Overall, ""ice"" beers are a joke, but I was really surprised that at 5.5% this beer made absolutely no effort to disguise its alcohol content. This is a truly horribly made beer, and I'm being completely objective. A warming furnace to your throat and stomach at a measly 5.5% ABV."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,1.8,"L: Pours typical golden amber color with a reasonably large head and some lacing.

S: Corn, malt, cracker and slight grassy hops.

T: Tastes way too alcoholic for the ABV. The only ice beer with noticable fusel alcohol, tastes worse than Steel Reserve with slightly less burn. Other than that, it does taste like corn and more malt than some beers. Doesn't taste anything like regular Genesee Beer, the cream ale, or even its high gravity cousin, Genesee Black.

F: Goes down smooth, a little syrupy but not too much body.

Overall: The worst ice beer. Even at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can, there are plenty of better options, including all of the other Genesee products which are pretty good."

Light corn and malt taste, too sweet, very thin mouthfeel, slight fizzy carbonation, light drinking. Overall ok offering."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,3.02,"24oz can stamped A249 poured into a bow tie glass at fridge temp 5.5% ABV. The beer pours bright pale straw yellow with abundant bone white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is faint with some corny sweetness and maybe sulfur. The taste is barely sweet with a little tang. Minimal grain presence and no bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and semi dry in the finish. There is a little slick feel after the swallow but no aftertaste. Overall, ok. This is an extremely cheap and non-offensive way to deliver alcohol to folks who happen to hate bitterness or grain presence in a beer. I would advise to drink this one ice cold. It does get better as it warms."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,3.5,"A very pleasant surprise! I rate Genesee Ice highly not so much for being an exceptional beer in itself, but for its price-value ratio. At 5.5% ABV and as low as $8 for a 15 pack here in RI, its body, flavour and strength beat out all other popular cheap beers, many of which cost significantly more. Its little brother Genesee Light falls (and tastes) flat however. And unlike the other low-end beer brands, Genesee Ice doesn't wreak the same havoc in your stomach if you're drinking a lot, which you probably will be with it. Due to an ongoing sale, it's been my cheap beer of choice for months, but even if similarly priced with Bud, Rolling Rock or Narragansett, (my prior go-to's,) I would argue it's better in about every way."

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

A bit of fruity corn aromas/flavors, but not overwhelming. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not too fruity/yeasty. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is good iced pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink.

L: crystal-clear, medium amber colored; good bit of white foam builds on pour, but immediately breaks down... actually some thin streaks of Belgian lace

S: generic adjunct lager aromas; on the malty (liquor) side... slightly toasty, dry straw grain aroma; hints of spiced apple, maybe white grape; slight whiff of alcohol... bland sort of manila folder note as well... altogether uninspiring, dull

T: rather dry, ever-so-slightly caramel-kissed, cereal-like malt base; strange notes of corn kernel and wet oxidized interior of lemon rind in finish/aftertaste... light, leafy bitterness begging to be intensified... the malt opens up a little, but its overall essence is of toasted corn syrup - a spicy ester away from being a mediocre maibock at best?

F: slight touch of sizzle on the edges of what's essentially a marginally watered-down wort... light-medium bodied, delicate oily plushness

O: industrial brewing being industrial... not sure why one would bother with a weaker version of a malt liquor - maybe it's a bit more daring of a drink than a light beer?... a beer seemingly caught between the better of two directions... buries Natty Ice, but I couldn't see getting this again"
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,5,Average ice beer. Not bad. It’s cheap. Got the 24oz can for 99cents. So the price is hard to beat. It’s not my favorite ice beer but I do pick it up every now and then. Drink it from the freezer ice cold. Cheers.
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.67,"Type: 24-oz can
Glass: Westvleteren 12 Trappist (for shits and giggles)
From: Grocery Outlet in Allied Gardens (San Diego), Calif.
Price: $1.19
Purchased: May 9, 2018
Consumed: May 10, 2018
Reviewed as: American Adjunct Lager
Misc.: No canned on date; #CraftAdjace

Picked a can up of this and regular Genesee Ice at Grocery Outlet after an eye appointment and realizing that I hadn’t reviewed Genesee Beer, Genny Light or this one (had never heard of a Genny Ice). Crazy. Genny Light was probably the beer I consumed the most in college unfortunately. Never even liked it then when it was High Falls Brewing and actually craft beer (I think), so really not expecting much. Being an ice beer, would be shocked if it reached a 2.25 for me. Description from their website read, “When you're looking for a rich, full-flavored beer, Genesee Ice is the perfect beer for you. Our brewmasters begin with only the purest natural ingredients. Then, ice crystals form in the beer during its aging process before it's filtered for the rich flavor Genesee Ice is known for.”

Poured a pale clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of off-white fizzy head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Below average watery lacing. Very bad retention. (Sight - 3.00)

Smelled apple, pear, purple grape, grain, corn, hints of cinnamon (really?), cereal and slight skunkiness. Pretty much the same from the can with maybe more booze, skunkiness and hints of vomit. (Smell - 2.75)

Taste was pretty bland overall. Thought it would be boozier. Got wet grain, corn, cereal, apple, slight herbal and cooked vegetables. Much better than I thought it would taste. (Taste - 2.75)

Light body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. Got worse as it went down. (Feel - 2.25)

Better than I thought, but not quite as good as the regular Genesee beer. (Overall - 2.50)

2.67 | 63 | C-"
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.25,"Looks a dark, rich gold or maybe an overachieving copper? Almost offensive in it’s lack of any appealing smell. Passable taste I guess. I love this beer for two reasons. One, it’s cheap. Two, the alcohol content. It’s at least as good as Budweiser, without paying extra for cutesy ads. Furthermore for you foamheads, if you know how to pour a beer, you would be minimizing foam, not hyping it."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,1.88,"Straw color with a decent head. Not much on smell at all, or taste. Super light body, barley felt like a beer, weak on flavors with corn being the most noticable. Not good"
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.75,"Poured a typical pale straw color, white fluffy head that fades pretty fast and there is little lacing left on the glass. This is a drinkable ice beer that is just under the too sweet flavor that turns me off. This is a hard to find beer in the Chicago and Milwaukee area. I found it in Madison. Worth a try if you like ice beers."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.82,"L - Gold color with transparent body. Plenty of soapy head that left no lacing

S - Typical macro aroma. Wet hay and grain.

T - Mild caramel sweetness with more grains and corn. Small metallic finish.

F - Thin body. No aftertaste. Actually goes down easy.

O - Not offensive to the palate. Some mild sweetness makes it a better macro choice than others."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.52,"Not the worst ice beer I've ever tasted, but the least favorite of the Genny beers I've tried so far. It's one of those beers that makes one question if they may be crossing the line into a diagnosible drinking problem. Beware."
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,3,Golden colored beer with a rapidly fading head. Taste is the usual graininess you get with macros. I like this beer and if you go by the style it fits perfectly.
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.48,"Got a single 24 oz can of this recently. Poured into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, medium to dark golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface. Has a white head that's over an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a nice, thick, creamy looking layer of surface with good lacing. Aromas of some lightly breaded malts, a bit of apple, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is pretty the same, with some lightly breaded caramel malts with a bit of sweetness that gives way to some graininess and a bit of grassy corn. Unfortunately this also has a bit of a metallic adjunct flavor. Not really an discernible hop flavor here. Has a fairly crisp, yet smooth, light to medium bodied mouth feel. Has a clean finish with a slightly dry and somewhat metallic aftertaste. I've had better beers of this style and I've certainly had worse.

Eric"
Worst,Genesee Ice Beer,2.58,"I dont know if we have the cheapeast prices in Mad Town or what. This 24oz can was 99 cents truly a working class price. They have had Genesse in Wisconsin for a while now. I really enjoyed the Genesse cream ale out in Buffalo a few years back, lets check this out.

I think I want this in the can, but i'll poor a bit out in this Old Style glass just to get a look...noticeably darker gold than most lagers, slow disapating head. Heavy sweet corn with slight metallic aroma. That color again, different.

First nip, kind of bland. From the can, bland, metallic. Grainy, corn, slighty sweet. Not all that good. Might be alright sittin out back with one of my Parodi cigars. I like the look of the old school can, the color of the beer is the best thing going for it. For 99 cent you cant go wrong."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.62,I researched and can't get a straight answer on if this beer is still brewed by Molson Coors. This is a beer that you could drink one or twelve..... smooth and consistent in taste. I hope to see on the Ohio shelves in the future.
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4.36,"Underrated... Such a GREAT tasting beer... sorry it had little to no success in my region. I live in a college town that has MEGA PACKAGE stores but NO EXTRA GOLD.... American Big Brews are SO UNDERRATED.... When they try an EXTRA GOLD or ""DopPle Bock"" they get axed by the Rednecks and Hipsters!!!!"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,2.52,"12 oz Gold Can

A: Pours a bright golden color. One finger of bubbly white head. Strong carbonation. No head retention or lacing. Color is nice though.

T/M: Grainy and sweet. Dry. Malts. A little creamy. Moderate carbonation. Crisp, clean dry finish. Slight hop taste. Grassy and faintly floral. Bready malts.

O: Pretty boring beer. Light on taste with a halfway decent mouthfeel. Could be crisper for me. I’ve had worse from this style.

Cheers!"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.92,"Honestly, some of the best beer you can get for $6.50 a 12 pack. In my opinion, tastes better than Budweiser, has the same ABV, and is much MUCH cheaper. Now I'm not a huge fan of Budweiser myself, but I know people are huge on it, and to those people, I'd say buy this and save a few bucks."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,2.27,"Rates about halfway between poor and below average. Pours a clear light gold color with decent head that fades quickly. Aroma is sweet and grainy. Taste follows the scent, just something slightly off that I can't describe. A bit more than light mouthfeel and an aftertaste that is best scribed as tinny"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,5,When I first drank it it had a bit to it and after the first one I noticed it was going down rather smooth and had a very enjoyable taste. I have now been drinking is for 5 years and you can't beat the price!
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4.94,"Extra Gold Lager is a rich, full-flavored lager with a deep golden color. Starts with slow aged roasted (near toasty and you can taste it) malts, which are then combined with its other ingredients (ONLY: Water, Barley Malt, A Germinated Corn Grind for a little extra maltose, Coors own nearly bottom possible temp yeast, cascade hops certainly, but I can't get an answer on their strain. Likely typical lager finishing hops because this beer is ALL LAGER. If it was in a clear Miller High Life bottle with a redesign it would go from lawnmower beer to the top of the domestic lager game. It's a robust, beautiful, full, crisp, clean, and perfect example of an American Lager. Slow-brewed to produce this truly refined lager in an unassuming packaging at an unassuming price. If I were PR I would repitch it with a marketing strategy and get back to basics. They're too bloated and monopolized to realize a blind test would put them in the top 5 American Lagers. I picture a small Coors original shape bottle with the brown glass and the stubby style with the same price.

Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Maltose), Yeast, Hop Extract"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4.18,"This here is a pretty gosh-darn easy lager to enjoy, folks. Unpretentious; best appreciated VERY, VERY cold.
A consistent pleasure for when what one wants is just a simple beer.
And as far as I can net-investigate, brewed only at the Golden, Colorado brewery.
This is a fine, excellent brew. One I hope Coors/Molson continues to brew.

Which it didn't. So, good-bye, Extra Gold, t'was good to enjoyeth.
R.I.P. (Rest in Recipe)"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.68,"The color is extra golden actually more like copper with a quickly dissipating white head of foam.

Smells like it has a bit of some sour mash, maybe like sour malts. Got it! With that bread like lager smell this smells like a sourdough bread. Love it or leave it.

The taste is pretty unremarkable or shocking. Tastes like a macro lager with a hint of sour. The sour is not offensive or overpowering. There is a bit of some sweet coming into play as well.

Mouth is a bit more towards medium with that unusual sour and sweet. Finishes easy with just a bit of oiliness.

Overall not a bad beer but more of what I would call it an inexpensive beer. Found this in a Colorado liquor store for 16.99 when I went back to Denver for a bit. This beer lends itself to be drinking it out of a can not a glass. I don't even think it wants to be analyzed because I think the cans are saying just open me and drink the damn beer."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4.55,I know opinions are like assholes everyone got one and they all stink...but in my defense I drank this beer before I was of age and every now and again when I want to feel like I’m doing something wrong but still want to feel good about it I buy two twelve packs. Once they are gone I move on once a year is good enough for me it’s kinda like pizza even bad pizza is still kinda good cause I mean it’s pizza come on you with me
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.37,"I always walked by this beer in the store wondering when I would finally take the plunge, and I’m glad I eventually did. It’s intersting that nowhere on the casing do you see the name “Coors.” I guess that must be part of its charm. This beer is insanely affordable compared to its Coors and Coors Light relatives, and I don’t believe the taste is far off. Coors Banquet beer will always be tops in my book, but Extra Gold still features the same signature Coors taste that makes this brand so popular, despite poor sales in 2018. Its light, corny, and easy on the ABV, which makes for a great summer time brew. In the age of flavorful craft beer, there is still a place for the macro American lager on certain occaisions. I hope Extra Gold sticks around, I’m buying it again. Definitely the best of the cheaper 30 rack items!"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,2.61,"On a budget this week and saw a 12 pack of this for $5.29 and couldn't resist. The clerk and myself agreed that for that price it can only be awful. We'll see. Brought to you by the folks at Coors. Their super-cheap swill line, I reckon.

To the eye, this stuff actually looks a lot better than your typical lager. Deep golden color; very active with tiny little bubbles constantly floating topside; minimal, foamy white head that never fully dissipates. My sniffer is a bit off thanks to suffering through a cold this week, but it's picking up quite a bit of corny sweetness. The taste follows and is accompanied by a somewhat off-putting amount of carbonation. Not digging that. Overall, though, this beats the pants off its pricier older sibling, Coors Light. I can see myself buying this again when breaking the 'ol piggy bank."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.39,"One of the first beers I tried when I turned 21. Impossible to find around here anymore, though. I remember that the cheap 30-packs were only found in niche stores even back in the day."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4,"Just picked up a 30 pack of this wonderful brew. Here in NJ a 30 pack costs $17.99. I've tried all of the Coors brands with the exception of their sweet beer. This beer is exceptional for the price point. It has a slight malt, hoppy and corn smell. It smells and tastes very good to me. I don't know why Coors doesn't advertise this as well as their Coors light or Banquet beers. I absolutely love the taste of this beer and would recommend it to anyone who drinks Budweiser. This is hands down is better than Budweiser! Cheers from the garden state!"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.6,"I've lived in Denver for over 20 years and drank Coors Extra Gold for years mainly because my wife liked it and it is about the cheapest beer you can buy ($17 for a 30 pack). But after drinking it so long for picnics and steaks on the grill over the years, I discovered it is really not a bad brew! It certainly does not compare with a fine craft beer. But after years of drinking it, it has become my favorite go-to beer. I don't think any mass produced beer compares. My wife and I have done taste comparisons with Stella and Heneken and we both think CEG has them beat by a mile. What I like is that it has a slight ""bite"" that I especially like. What I can't understand is (1) why does Coors sell this beer so cheap? (2) Why is this beer not advertised by Coors? (3) Why is it only available (in the Denver market) in cans? (4) Why is it only available in certain markets? I think Coors underestimates Coors Extra Gold."
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,3.83,"Picked up a case of this for when you want to drink something with a bit of alcohol in it but also want to stay hydrated.

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a crystal clear dark gold color with a one finger white head that faded unusually slowly to leave a creamy halo and a thin blanket. Uhhmmm...wut? There is even some nice lacing. I don't think I've ever had a macro or adjunct lager had a head that stayed like this. Almost like a pilsner. What the...

S - Aromas of lightly sweet malts, roasted/toasted corn. Much more of a toasted corn note than the usual BMC. Little grassy note. Most corn forward macro I've smelled that also didnt have a syrupy note to it. Err...ooookaaayyy... Not entirely sure if I got a super 'fresh' can or what but this is the best smelling adjunct lager I've come across. For what it is this is thoroughly impressive.

T - Taste is sweeter malts, more of that toasted corn. No metallic taste though nor am I getting any syrupy or skunked notes. Tastes like I assume what a bowl of soggy day old cornflakes with water instead of milk would taste like with maybe a little bit of bread soaked in there too. It's corn water, sure, but there aren't any 'off' flavors here. Also it's not overly sweet by any stretch of the imagination which other than maybe Schiltz 60's formula makes this the only macro I've had that wasn't super sweet. It still is what it is though, corn water.

M - Mouthfeel is the usual crisp, watery self but because it's not sweet or syrupy it comes across as rather refreshing.

O - Overall...what the hell is going on? This really is shockingly good. Of course it doesn't hold a candle to IPAs or any other style for that matter but this is like comparing a junkyard beater to a nice car on the lot. Sure, the lot car is going to be a hell of a lot nicer but they both get you from point A to point B. And unlike other junkyard cars (macro BMC lagers) this one, for what it is, actually isn't half bad. Certainly would not be my beer of choice if offered just about any craft beer, however, I would take this over any other adjunct lager or macro beer out there. Maybe I got lucky and got a good can of it but man, reviewing based totally on the style, this is leaps and bounds ahead of all the others. My world is shook.

Serving Type: Can"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,4.03,"OK...I get it. Not everyone is, or has been flocking to consume this beer. However, for those thousands of semi-disillusioned drinkers of standard ""go to beers"", (i.e. Bud heavy, Bud light, Coors Light, Miller, Corona, etc.), this is an excellent ""go to beer"" that I have enjoyed for about 30 years or so. [Sidebar - It was great in a bottle; wish it was available on draft!] There is a reason why this beer has endured for so long. Not many even know of its existence, (due to lack of major marketing efforts), but thanks to word of mouth, beer drinkers are pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong; I absolutely LOVE and support the top-end beers with all the bells & whistles, but this beer (for the price and taste), ain't all that bad. Just sayin'!"
Worst,Coors Extra Gold,2.78,"Same place I got the other few. Dented can for $1. Never knew Coors brewed another lager and to be quite honest I don't expect much out of this one at all.

Pours the typical dehydrated urine yellow with a large bone white head that sticks around for an eternity leaving crater upon crater in the glass.

Smells like Coors banquet though there is something rather..papery about this one.

Follows the typical AAL suit though there is a touch of wheat which makes it a bit better until that odd wet papery flavors comes through.

Feel is light bodied with a boat load of carbonation. Swallows easy and the wheaty aspect becomes a bit more prominent as it sits around the mouth.

Overall just another generic AAL. The wheat would have made it above average had the paper not been a throw off in the flavor and nose. Oh well. Worth a dollar. Random gas station brews are all gone, time to kill these last four Dorados."
Worst,New,2.4,"Tooheys New. The pride of New South Wales. ANother mainstream Aussie adjunct lager, it's a NSW icon, much like VB is to Victoria, XXXX Queensland, Emu Export to WA and West End to SA. It's not something i've had in a while, as previously I found it too sweet for my liking. But let's give it a fair crack...

Look: Standard Aussie Macro lager. Deep Golden Straw, filtered, highly carbonated. Head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top. Lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top. Standard stuff.

Smell: Wet grassy hops, from the standard Pride of Ringwood hops, which also gives a slight sour lemon/citrus nose, pale malt sweetness. Smells like an Aussie adjunct lager

Taste: Heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip, a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang. Pretty clean and smooth. Carbonation is heavy, and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly.

Feel: Highly carbonated, so refreshing when drunk ice cold. It's clean, easy drinking especially if you're just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours.

Overall: it's better than what I remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market, but it's pretty bland to be honest. There's not a lot going on flavour profile wise, and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around. Having said that, you need to drink this ice cold - much like VB as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky. A decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day,"
Worst,New,2.91,"Pours pale golden with plenty of carbonation rising. Decent 1 finger head that has good lasting power.

Aroma of corn, light malt and slightly bready.

Taste is of light malt, corn, and somewhat grassy. Rather sweet. Tastes better than expected (expectations were low).

Mouthfeel is light body and lightly cleansing. Somewhat dry in the mouth.

Overall, a decent hot weather beer. Maybe slightly better for the style than most. Still, nothing to get too excited about."
Worst,New,3,Gold in color with a half inch of off white covering the top. The aroma is of corn and that’s it. I’m tasting some corn and light malt. There’s a trace of grassy hops. The mouth is highly quaffable and thin.
Worst,New,3.25,"From can, pours Amber with thin white head which fades away very quickly. Aroma of grain, hops. Taste is some malts and a little hop bitterness. Not to bad."
Worst,New,3.29,"Format: a mid-brown 375mL stubby with the age-old Tooheys New macro label.

Appearance: a solid amber in colour with plenty of chunky macro lager carbonation. A finger of white head drops to a thick cap. Sporadic lacing.

Aroma: an aroma of proper grain (rather than cheap grain and adjuncts). Better than most macro lagers.

Taste: again a touch better with those same flavours - Tooheys New surprises me a little whenever I have it (which is rare). There is a reason why this and VB are two of the most-bought macro lagers in the country.

Aftertaste: more grains and husk here with the slightest touch of hop bitterness. Some sweetness too from indistinct origins.

Mouth feel: moderate in feel with a higher carbonation to bring through that fantastically refreshing crispness.

Overall: Tooheys New continues to surprise me when I occasionally drink it. It is one of the standard Aussie macro lagers, but there is a reason it is one of the mainstays in Australian pubs. It is a definite cut above most standard cheap macro lagers, and decent at AU$45 for a case of 24 x 375mL stubbies. Most importantly, one of my favourite pub beers wouldn't be an option without New (a 50/50 - or Black n Tan for you Americans - with half Tooheys Old and half Tooheys New)."
Worst,New,2.15,"Pretty grim. Looks a lot better than it tastes, but that's not saying much, believe me. Flavor a this beer is adjunct flavored grain with some generic sweet that wont go away. Not good. I feel a headache coming on. Weird body; almost feels like there's glycerin in it. Stay away from this beer. :You'll thank me"
Worst,Redbridge,2.64,"DATE: February 19, 2022... OCCASION: back from the WMC semifinal loss, we turn to the Office (and I, to this beer) to lift our spirits... GLASSWARE: Baltika stonge... an orange-amber body shows reasonable effervescence that builds a quarter-finger of off-white, sudsy head... looks palatable... light lemon zest, toasted biscuit, faint hard fruits, honey, and cough drop... a rather clean, refreshing, cider-like movement through the palate... its start has a bit of hoppy chatter, while its finish is refreshingly soft and swift... not much of the limited aroma makes it to the flavor profile--what does is honey, pear, apple, wood, and banana... there isn't a lot to its substance, but it does hit the genre's goal well enough... at its ABV%, this wins for a long night of drinking... as a stand-alone, not too much to celebrate... in can be found in most beer stores, so that is also a plus..."
Worst,Redbridge,1.83,"Gluten free? Yes? Taste free? Yes! I understand there’s a market for this, but this was almost undrinkable, and got worse as it warmed. Sorghum makes for a funky, musty overall aroma and taste. Blech."
Worst,Redbridge,3.19,"Purchased as a single bottle from Ingles for $1.50. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear amber with a one-finger sudsy off-white head. Actually great lacing.
S - Sweet, but not in a sugary way. Herbal. Some kind of fruit, but I can't pin down which one.
T - It tastes like literal raw sugar cane, minus most of the sweetness - but I can tell it's sweet, if that makes any sense at all. Almost tastes of granny smith apple skin, but then it doesn't. A somewhat metallic finish. It doesn't taste objectively bad, though.
F - Medium-light body with nitro-like carbonation. Refreshing. Wet. Crisp.
O - This beer's flavor HAS to be an acquired taste. Not for the reason I see many people drinking it (I don't), but because it doesn't taste bad, but for the reason that I'm not familiar with the flavors present. It's this non-cloying sweetness, with some sort of herbal vibe, minus the herbs. It almost tastes like a sassafras soda, but not in any sort of ""exact"" sense. It's almost like Malta Goya, but swap the Raisin Bran flavor with some mysterious flavor you've never had that can only be in the area of ""molasses"" - but not really. Buy it to try it yourself, but I probably won't again."
Worst,Redbridge,5,"Love this! Having to be gluten free is the absolute pits and I had no high expectations for this beer. While it doesn't have that pungent beer smell, it's light and smooth and actually tastes great! I was very pleasantly pleased and will definitely buy this brand again. The ""beer guy"" at my local Kroger said this was the best gluten free beer on the market. Right now, I'll agree!"
Worst,Redbridge,2.52,"Recently diagnosed with late-developing Celiac disease. Looks like it's Redbridge and other gluten-free offerings going forward for this newly semi-retired reviewer. My reviews will steadily decline going forward. Run towards the fire with eyes wide open, grinning ear-to-ear, my fellow reviewers!"
Worst,Redbridge,2.8,"I had to try this sorghum-free beer...

...Not that it was bad or good, just different. The strangest thing was the smell, it had a coca-cola-like odor to my nose. I couldn’t shake it. Anyway, it’s nothing really bad but certainly nothing special either."
Worst,Redbridge,3.42,Got this since my girlfriend is gluten free - I've had it occasionally over the years. It wasn't a stunner but felt like a reliable red lager. Drinkable and inoffensive.
Worst,Redbridge,2.93,"Taste: hint of some cider, sour fruit, corn, earthy grains, airy mouthfeel. Cider like nose. Caramel colored hue, clear, with small head and lace. Medium/light body. Not my kinda taste."
Worst,Redbridge,3.1,"This one wasn't bad. My first gluten-free, wheat-free beer so I had low expectations and on that front, it wasn't too shabby at all. Reminded me of a slightly more flavorful, less watered-down AAL. No date printed on bottle. Pours a lighter amber color with just a thin film of white head and no real lacing. Smells of malt, grain, caramel, a little nuttiness, no real hops. Tastes similarly, somewhat refreshing and not too bad but a little touch of sweetness at the finish. Mild thin mouthfeel, decent carbonation. I tried it and it wasn't too bad but I wouldn't buy it again."
Worst,Redbridge,2.81,"(12 oz bottle, 19259; purchased single off shelf... poured into a 14 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, amber liquid; fizzy off-white head.... razor-thin collar remains, no lace

S: vaguely grassy-herbal tone ahead of a mildly grain-syrup base: slight note of apple cider vinegar?... decent relative intensity, but clearly lacking malt

T: ooof! hmm... papery and dry up front, with a bit of a lightly-sweetish, basic cider aftertaste... long after the first sip, the aftertaste is that of a weaker, drier Sidral Mundet, with a subtle cooked corn kernal note... subtle phenol spice builds, remaining mellow but lingering along with the corn

F: very lightly-spritzy carbonation, rather dry finish... its body is thin, lacking roundness, with a strange almost inward, vacuum drop in the finish

O: not terrible, but perhaps not worth it on its own... tastes more like a beer-flavored diet alco pop? (1602)"
Worst,Redbridge,1.86,"This beer has such an odd aftertaste and is ridiculously sweet. This is the first gluten free beer more people have tried and it sours the idea of a good gluten free beer. They are definitely out there, but this is not one of the good ones. Stick with a cider or find something less mass produced."
Worst,Redbridge,5,A gluten free beer that actually tastes like a beer!!! Glad I found this because there are not too many gluten free beers out there that don't taste like a fruity wine.
Worst,Redbridge,3,"Meh, this would be the best reason to rate this beer. If you crave anything gluten free, start with this and then try some hard cider. If you do not like apples then try something else beer related. That is all I have for now. A middle of the road brew that finishes clean and keeps consistent texture throughout."
Worst,Redbridge,5,"I'm rating this a 5 because, unlike many of the reviewers, I do have to avoid gluten at all costs -- or risk becoming very sick. I had given up on the idea of ever having beer until trying Omission, but I honestly think it's just OK. I rarely bothered to buy it. I decided to try Redbridge when I saw it in a local grocery store (which is something of a miracle in itself) and I'm enjoying my first one as I write this review. I'm thrilled that it actually tastes like beer to me! Before gluten issues, I wasn't a gourmet beer drinker, but I do know what I like and Redbridge works for me. I'm very grateful that someone bothered to make a gluten-free beer that wasn't an apple cider beer or a beer that tasted like it had already gone flat. I'm happy!"
Worst,Redbridge,5,"I love this beer! I grieved when I thought I’d never enjoy beer again after being dignosed with a gluten allergy. This beer is a game changer! I love the taste, the smoothness and the sweet after taste. Ahhhh my life has become so much better since this discovery!!! Highly recommended!"
Worst,Redbridge,3.34,"Reddish gold color, white medium collar that reduces quickly to a spotty cover. Sweet beery aroma. Very neutral taste. Refreshing beer & the gluten-free has to be a welcome pleasure to people that are gluten intolerant."
Worst,Redbridge,3.41,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, 13288 bottle code. Pours crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light biscuit/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too too fruity aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with sorghum grains and mild earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light biscuit/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, honey, brown sugar, toasted bread, light biscuit/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of sorghum grains and mild earthy hop flavors; with a solid sugar/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes present. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is a solid gluten free amber lager. All around good robustness of sorghum grains and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful for the ABV. Clean sorghum grains and mild earthy hop presence. An enjoyable offering, just a little too sweet."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.33,"May 2011: 355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. I felt compelled to sample this beer - Brazil is such a big country, and I was kind of shameful for not having sampled any of their beers previously ... ABV is 4.5%. Very pale yellow colour, moderate white head. Sweetish, sugary and grainy aroma, hints of maize - but not awful. Bland and ""dusty"" flavour, fairly dry and thus kind of refreshing when ice cold, but the bitterness is very low, and there are hardly any flavour elements worth mentioning. Utterly forgettable. For the sake of Brazilian beer entusiasts, if they exist: I do hope you have access to better beers than this!"
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.45,"12oz bottle coded J048 1543 poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 4.7% ABV per label. The beer pours bright light straw yellow with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is faint with light malt, grain and very slight lager yeast. The taste is grainy malt, with a touch of sour, a tiny bit of grassy hops ending with a mildly bitter (barely vegetable) finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, highly carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. No glaring off flavors or flaws. Overall, ok, as a German Pilsner. It would be very good as an AAL, but I'm not sure there are any brewing adjuncts used in the production. Tastes like maybe all 2-row barley. This beer was actually bottled by Cervejas Premium Do Brazil St. John, NB Canada and imported by www.eurobrews.com."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.16,"L: Clear honey gold color with almost no head or lacing.

S:. Toasted cracker malt, notes of apple and some slightly skunky hops and corn.

T:. Sweet apple, some corn and a little malt. Tastes a little watery. Not much flavor.

F: Light body and clean with higher carbonation

O: This is your typical tropical beach lager, light without much flavor."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,1.89,"This stuff is worse than your average macro brew. I only paid about two bucks for a bottle but it's still not worth that price, better off just getting coors."

Mediocre aromas, some mild malt and earthy hops; but very poor strength. Flavors of cracker, corn, and light herbal hops. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish.

Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a pretty poor pale lager. Very bland in flavors; but it’s crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. No real flaws or off flavors; just very watery and flavorless."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.05,"Pours a slghtly milky-opaque yellow-orange. Very short-lived,3/8"" white head,despite an aggressive pour.A tiny bit of lacing ringing the edge of the glass..

Aroma is almost not there. Has a very slight sour/boozy/yeasty aroma, reminiscent of the tail end of the aroma of a quad. This is a very recent arrival, so I assume it is fairly fresh, and it's not spoiled or old.

The taste is very slight , and mix of tangerine,pineapple, and rye bread, with a slight sour tang. Took half the bottle to get a enough taste to dissect it. Nothing overly offensive in the taste, just very little of it. That might be a good thing, and the ""Taste"" rating reflects that. :)

Carbonation is fine-textured, and pleasantly prickly. There is a strange after-feel on the mid to back tongue, and roof of the mouth. Sort of sticky, and chalky, almost as if a piece of damp,rough cardboard has been rubbed around, and then left stuck to the back of the tongue. A rougher communion wafer? : )

Overall, probably OK on a hot summer day, when there are no other options. Drink it quickly though, because it only gets worse as it warms.
I mentioned this to a friend living in Brasil {That's how THEY spell it. ;) }, as I drank it in honor of her birthday. She laughed uproariously. Apparently, it has .....a reputation?..... even in Brasil. ;)"
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,2.52,"Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Decent looker. Clear and with a bit of fine carbonation, much of it racing quite quickly. Head creation is a bit soapy, not unlike your typical pils, a simple soapy three finger head manages to settle to a bubbled thin puck and collar. Pretty much alright in the looks department.

There's a weird aroma going on here. Flaked maize and corny smelling a bit for a German pils and comes off more like a basic American Pale Lager. Quite sweet, a bit of vegetation and quite macro smelling. Not too many off flavors detectable at least, but not really giving up the goods here either.

Woah.. Where did that body go. Surprisingly and exceptionally wet and almost rice bodied light in mouthfeel that does nothing to get a classic pils let alone a corn lager come through. Flakey palate, sweet corn flavored and lingering a bit. Quite surprised how little body there is to this beer, as it comes off like a diet beer.

Poundable ice cold beach beer, that's about it."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.16,"A- Pours pale yellow and crystal clear. Not a lot of head but surprisingly strong lacing- lines and dots abound.

S- mostly corn. A bit of biscuity. Not much aroma. It's not really bad just a lot of corn.

T- corn like the aroma. Some mild hints of grassy hops but not too much flavor.

M- super light easy drinking.

O- as expected mostly a light lager. Not quite as inoffensive as most but pretty bland."
Worst,Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,3.13,Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a pale yellow color with a small white head. The aroma is mostly malt with some grass and hops in the background. The taste is very similar to an American adjunct lager. An average beer.
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.79,"Have to have 1 or 2 nites per week no alcohol so I have these fake beers often. German, American, Canadian doesnt matter. All taste like crap but this one doesn’t have the tell tale after taste I am used to. Nice carbonation and not a malt bomb so is drinkable."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.71,I loved it. For a non alcoholic beer it tasted just like a real beer. No malt or bad aftertaste at all. I absolutely love it and will start drinking this all the time.
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,4.5,"The color and feel of a straw colored seroma, pleasantly metallic tasting notes with a clean, wispy finish. It’s a sentimental favorite—the groomsmen and I will always have Carmel and Old Milwaukee."

[b]Only available in cans in my area.[/b] This poured with a very light straw yellow color
It produced a three finger head and still had a full head an hour later.
The aroma was definitely that of a decent beer!
The taste was that of a very light, but fairly full bodied light beer with no burnt or overtly sweet aftertastes.
I was not expecting much because Old Milwaukee has been in and out of production, but for a non alcoholic beer, this is one American NA beer I would serve to my guests along with Clausthaler and Becks, the best of the bunch!!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1,"If you absolutely crave one of the worst beers in the world without the silver lining of at least catching a buzz ""It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This"". Falls flat on it's ass in every single category. I'd rather drink a Barq's root beer than this. At least Barq's doesn't make your stomach turn with every gulp."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.42,"A: Pours a crystal clear medium straw yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and some faint golden yellow highlights. The beer has a three finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of medium thick film surrounded by a very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of corn adjuncts over lighter aromas of grainy malts.

T: Upfront there are light flavors of grainy malts with light to moderate flavors of corn adjuncts, slightly vegetal. Minimal amounts of sweetness or hop presence. Overall the beer has a very light flavor more reminiscent of mineral water than a beer.

M: Light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin/watery.

O: Very drinkable and definitely lacks the chemical-like flavor that you get in a lot of the American NA lagers. Very light flavor and aroma."

Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2,I tried this as I've been drinking regular Old Milwaukee lately as think it's fine and I wanted something for my weekly alcohol-free day. This near-beer is very poor in comparison. Very watery and a bit nasty with acres of foam. Throwing out the rest of the case.
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.32,"A: The beer is clear straw yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high bright white head that died down but generally left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and some lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of cooked corn are present in the nose.
T: The taste is similar to the smell, but has less in the way of vegetal flavors and more in the way of bland mineral water. No sweetness or malts are really perceptible because of a slight amount of hop bitterness.
M: It feels light-bodied and a bit watery on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer seemed a little more drinkable compared to some of the other non-alcoholic beers that I've tried because it didn't have any astringent chemical-like aromas or flavors."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,3.08,"Served chilled from a can and poured into a Perfect Pint and let warm up to about 40º.

A=I was initially put off by the very light, pale straw color, but after a few minutes, it looked a bit darker. The white foam lasted around a minute...but it dissipated sporadically--in other words, there were small spots of foam left near the middle.

S=Surprisingly decent aroma--malt, bread, and honey smells.

T=The typical NA skunk flavor was there, along with a light bread flavor...perhaps a hint of clover?

M=Body was light and carbonation rather low...despite feeling flat, it was rather drinkable.

O=It has been years since I drank a lot of NA beers, and my recollection was that the German beers were far superior to the domestic offerings...still, I recall O'Doul's being undrinkable, and this is a bit superior...I still have half the 12-pack left, which will be reserved for snakebites and mixing with the On Tap additives to see if I can find a better flavor. I won't buy this one again."

For my 1,250th review I figured I would do something I do not routinely drink. It pours a pale yellow that looks almost as clear as water with an extraordinary foamy head.

It has the typical biscuit and barley malt nose of an L/A-N/A but no alcohol or hops for that matter.

Thin to nearly watery body.

Grainy and biscuit malts in the taste but no lingering anything. It is only 58 calories so that is a good thing."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.23,"Served in an Ohio State shaker pint glass.

Funny, something tells me the whole Spelunky drinking challenge isn't gonna work all that well with a non-alcoholic offering... Oh well. This stuff pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises malted barley (fresh from the sack, baby) and lightly-funky water. The taste mostly resembles water, though a twinge of funky, stale ""beer"" tossed in for appearances' sake. Honestly, I have no other way to describe this stuff. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a very watery feel. Overall, I find it difficult to refer to this as beer, even a non-alcoholic one. It seems more like beer-flavored water than anything. I can't imagine why anyone would ever drink this stuff purposely."

Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.69,"This is the stuff legends are made of. 12 oz can best before Jan 2012.

It pours a clear gold with lots of carbonation bubbles and a non-receding bright white head. Typical industrial macro lager look.

It smells like squash, bread, sugar, and hop ""extract"".

The flavor is pale malt extract and metal. Simple, not extremely offensive. The mouthfeel is thin.

It is what it is."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1,"Spotted at a local dive bar I was inclined to try something shitty...I thought it was the red label but it was the NA. Here it goes pours a pale fizzy yellow golden color with a bright white head quickly dwindling away. Aroma has a pale malt sweetness with no real hop or spice to it just simply cooked vegetables at the basic meaning. Flavor is horrid cooked corn basically the worst tasting anyting creamed corn related in liquid form I will never go NA when it comes to beer I would rather cut out alcohol than go NA. This is horrible tasting liquid, horrible rancid finish high uncomfortable carbonation light bodied fizzy beer. Sorry I usually try to enjoy these types of reviews this one just isn't enjoyable in any sense."
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,2.91,"I was D.D. tonight so I tried this NA.

It pours a clear, palest shade of yellow, with overly foamy, detergent-like head. Head lasts a surprisingly long time. It also laces the glass beautifuly. The scent at first was wet hay or grass, then rice. The problem here is it's nearly tasteless! That is, it doesn't offend, it's crisp but not ""beery"" no hops, no barley malt, perhaps just fermented Rice Krispies! No lingering aftertaste. Best point, you can drink all you can stand to drink!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.36,"There are not many N.A. beers in a CAN remaining for me to try, if you CAN believe it. O'Doul's Amber and Old Style L.A. are the only two that I am still aware of that have not been part of The CANQuest (TM).

My pour produced two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a foul rankness, like rotting vegetable matter. No kidding, it would have gagged a maggot! Ooof. The mouthfeel was thin, kind of watery and the taste remninded me of Wheaties, albeit fermented. Not a pleasant taste. The underside of the CAN read ""SEP 27 2010"" so freshness was not a factor in this gag-a-thon. Finish left me with buyer's/drinker's remorse and not much beyond that. I believe that this was my seventh or eighth N.A. beer on The CANQuest (TM) and it was hands-down the worst!"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.46,"Quite possibly the worst ""beer"" I've had ever. Drank straight from a 12 oz can.

Appearance - Your basic American lager, yellow and fizzy.

Smell - Had an odd bread like scent, no detectable hops.

Taste - Awful, absolutely awful. It was the taste you get when your eating Wonder Bread and it gets stuck to the roof of your mouth.

Mouthfeel - Very watery

Drinkability - You have to be kidding me, why would anyone even finish this one?"
Worst,Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,1.8,"A: Yellow urine color, excessive carbonation, bubbles never leave the bottom of the glass, the foamy head is poor and handicapped;

S: Very sweet, corn syrup;

T: Corn with little malt;

M: Watery, fizzy and sweet, no body;

D: Very good only if you have to drive cars."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,4.88,"I had this beer in China and it was my personal favourite. Liked it better than the other Chinese beers. Easy drinking and nice and strong. It's typically drunk when you're eating spicy Asian food. The general reason is that it helps to clear the palate in a refreshing hydrating way so you can move on to the next spicy dish. That's probably the reason why it's so popular in China especially for Chinese food banquets. So if you're having spicy Asian food, you really cannot go wrong with this beer. It is in my opinion, a hidden gem that I was glad to discover."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.38,"12oz bottle from Brewers Haven. Very pale gold, with a nice tight, rocky head, lots of lacing. Grainy, malty aroma, some corn. Taste is sweet, and more grainy flavors, and lacking any vegetal notes you usually get with cheap lagers. Tasty, smooth, light."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.83,"Let’s be real: the beer is what it is. I’m not going to call it a Chinese Heineken, but it still isn’t gonna win me over like Kiera Knighlty in a nightie. What I like is that my homeboy down the street at the liquor store told me to put it in the freezer for 20 minutes before I pop it. And you know what I got? Ice cold nothing! Which is better than regular cold skunk.

I’ll drink to that!

...Honestly, I kind of like it!"
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.44,"Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; no production information.
A: Pours a crystal clear, straw to golden color with a two finger, foamy white head, decent retention, but spotty lacing at first, although it picks up lower on the glass.
S: Peppery and toasty with grainy (especially corn) and grassy aromas.
T: Semidry. Fruity (apple and corn) and very lightly malty with a surprising degree of bitterness given the style and area of origination.
M: Light bodied with very solid carbonation. Drinks smoothly, crisply, and cleanly.
O: This is a solidly constructed lager without being stand out. It is no longer in the clear bottle, as depicted above, but rather in a green one (which is no improvement from the perspective of skunking. The absence of a production date is a problem, especially as it is an import and trying hard to penetrate the American market."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.44,"Pours a clear medium yellow that resolves to faint lacing.
Smell is fairly strong sweet corn malt.
Taste is skunky sweet corn malt and slightly bitter finish."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.55,"Look: Clear yellow. Small white head that quickly dissipates.

Smell: Badly skunked thanks to the green bottle. Corn malt behind the bad smell.

Taste: Corn adjunct malt with a faint sweetness and skunkiness.

Mouthfeel: Thin and highly carbonated, like water.

Overall: A poor excuse for beer."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.55,"Yup, here's Beijing's version of Bud, although it isn't AS grainy.

The beer is clear straw color but leaves a small, big-bubbled head

It certainly seems to be devoid of hop, leaving the smell almost nonexistent. The flavor is passable for an Adjunct Lager. Decent body, considering the style but the carbonation is elevated, naturally. A lawn mower beer through and through."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,1.35,"Let's just say I prefer the crappy alternative Tsingtao. Which means this beer is beyond crappy.

Only drink this in China airport lounges when no other booze is avail."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.28,"Poured into a small pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fizzy, one finger white head that dissipates to patches and a slender ring around the glass. Aroma of adjunct malt, faint grassy hops and apple; a hint of caramel. Amazingly, no skunkiness despite a green bottle. Flavor is sweet adjunct malt (the mild sweetness suggests rice), apple and pear juice, faint caramel and grassy hops. Medium bodied with a mild creaminess, above average for an adjunct. A more classic American adjunct profile than many other off-shore lagers of this style, with the pleasant mild sweetness and neutral malt. Flavor is steady throughout the taste with little drop off in the finish. The adjuncts are slightly sweeter and the fruit notes slightly more noticeable than a domestic, but overall shows off the bland, but consistent flavor that has made this a world dominating style (at least for a while). This is so similar to a domestic mass market beer it is puzzling why it would be a good candidate for import, but whatever. It gave me another Chinese beer to try, and I'm not expecting to get a craft one from there. Full satisfactory and drinkable for an adjunct lager. Kudos to the shippers and warehouses that kept this green bottled lager in the dark and drinkable."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.25,"This is the beverage of choice when I'm in Beijing. I go for this when the choices are hot tea, hot water, hot soup, room temp fruit nectar or cold Yanjing. As my in-laws tell me by drinking the tap water will risk an illness. During meals, I can easily drink 2 liters without much effect. A six pack at a Beijing Walmart set me back about $2.

Look: yellow with a scant amount of foam
Smell: corn and whiffs of malt
Taste: corn juice with a hint of hops
Feel: watery
Overall: not bad if drinking every other year"
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.38,"I'm not gonna pretend to understand a goddamn thing about the Chinese beer market. I guess maybe I can assume that since this is suddenly available stateside, in an area with a non-particularly large Chinese population, that this has recently been acquired by MolsonCoors or Inbev. Or maybe not.

Green bottle. Pours dark for a pilsener and initially very fizzy, but the head dies away quickly and the beer becomes still.

Smells mildly, pleasantly skunked. Like a european import from the late 90s or early 2000s, before freshness became an issue and everything got packed in darker glass. It's a dumbly nostalgic smell, and while I like it I realize it is not objectively all that good.

Tastes... okay. It's aged, but there's more going on here than in the other mass produced east-Asian pils I've had. Mild skunk up front, a thick and lively grainbill in the middle, and a sweet and slightly stale finish of fruit.

Fresh, this would probably be pretty good. Stale, it's still ok."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3,"I purchased a bottle of Yanjing Beer in El Monte, California/USA for $2.69 USD.

Look: Yanjing Beer had a bright yellow colour with light foam.
Smell: Yanjing Beer had an aroma of bittersweet malts mixed with chemicals.
Taste: Yanjing Beer had a taste of malts.
Feel: Yanjing Beer had average amounts of carbonation.
Overall: People who enjoy a beer that has average amounts carbonation may enjoy Yanjing Beer."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,3.22,"The poured beer doesn't look very good, the head disappears rather quickly, but the aroma and the taste are decent. This one is more hoppy than most Chinese beers, and doesn't taste as watered down or sweet. The feel is a bit over carbonated in my opinon, making the drink feel more like a soda than a beer."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.92,"Pours out into a Duvel glass a clear bright yellow color with a 1/2"" snow white head that soon recedes to a ring around the glass and a thin layer of foam with a patch here and there on the sides of the glass. Sipping leaves some widely scattered speckles and legs of lacing. If there had been some foam around to the end of the beer the score would probably have been higher.

The aroma initially has a slight touch of skunk that quickly disappears and so will not be factored into the rating score because that is a retailer storage issue not a brewing issue. The aroma is quite faint but has hints of malt and what may be hops.

The light, subtle flavors initially tend toward the sweet side but then quickly become dry, as one would expect from the use of rice as an adjunct. There is really no noticable bitterness

The mouth feel is on the light side of medium and the slight prickly feel from carbonation only lasts for about half the beer. The finish is reasonably long, begins in the light malt sweetness and then tapers off into dryness.

Overall this is a drinkable beer for people who are thirsty and don't want much flavor in their beer. Doing several in an evening would not be a problem, but for myself I want something with more flavor than this offers."
Worst,Yanjing Beer,2.81,"A: It's clear gold, with a head that rapidly disappears, and small bubbles.
S: Slight smells of rice, corn, malt, floral, and some skunk.
T : It's like slightly bitter flavored water. A little rice taste, and a little grass, but that's about it.
M: Feels very watery. Smooth, and easily chug able.
O: It looks pretty, but would rather drink regular water or tea then this. Must find something else."
Worst,Cara Pils,1.3,"I drank a can of this beer at a friend's place, he hated them, but didn't want to throw them away. It is a beer generally drunk by homeless people on the street, to give you an idea. It looks like a regualr pils beer, although much lighter. It has a very unfresh smell, and the flavor is awful. Can't really put my finge rto what it is eaxctly, but I never tatsed something like that before. The beer also leaves a very penetrating flavor and felling in the mouth Definitely the worst beer I ever drank."
Worst,Cara Pils,1.69,"Cara Pils is generally drank because it is the cheapest beer available in the Belgian market. Thus is carries a bit of a stigma in Belgium. People drink this for the sale purpose of getting drunk as cheaply as possible when they have absolutely no money. It is crap but it is ridiculously cheap. I mean, really, really cheap, buying an equal amount of water at the supermarket costs more money than this beer.

Second note, I believe that Piedboeuf doesn’t brew this. No one actually brews Cara Pils, they just buy this stuff from whatever brewery makes it the cheapest. Sometimes contracts change, I have heard that they put failed batches from several pils brewers into this stuff, probably including stuff from Piedboeuf. The French brewery Champigneulles (TCB Beverages) who specializes in this kinds of beers most likely makes most of this stuff, these days.

Review: Bright, clear, golden, urine-coloured with little brief white head. Musty, wet corn in the nose, hay, dirty water, rotting lemon,… Watery, corn wet and dusty, rotting hay, light rotting, touch metallic, rotting lemon, expired medication, unnerving bitterness,… bitter disgusting aftertaste. Wattery. Not very good, touch better than expected."
Worst,Cara Pils,2.52,"This belgian cult-pilsener is not as bad as you would expect. It's cheap and has a bad image.
But compared to world famous 'beers' like Heineken, it can still hold its own.
On any given summer sunday I prefer an ice cold Cara over most popular pilseners.

Sure, the taste is not great, it tastes somewhere in between foul and average, but at the bargain price of 0,26€/33cl, this is to be expected. Bad image aside, this is just a regular pilsener, which would be much better liked if it was branded better."
Worst,Cara Pils,2.06,"Purchased at a convenience store in Brugge late at night partially out of late night desperation, partially to see if a Belgian beer is capable of sucking. 33 cl can, .50 Euro. Dated 01-13. Intersting that a freshness date on a pils would be that far out. Tastes like a cheap pilsner, but not as bad as expected. I suppose it is only bad when compared against all other beer in Belgium but when compared to beer all over the world, actually not so terrible. Probably need to remove the word ""premiere"" from the can."
Worst,Cara Pils,1,"Ah Cara pils, I'm not going to do a detailed review for this brew. This is probably the worst Belgian beer. The smell reminds you of cat urine and the taste isn't any beter. This is the cheapest beer you can get here, so it is not really brewed for a good taste. It is unsurprisingly not popular in Belgium, it's main customers are people who want to get drunk and want to do that as cheap as possible. One can of Cara is about 25 eurocents (about 33 U.S. cents using todays exchange rates).

In my student club, drinking a can of cara ad fundum is even considered a punishment at a cantus. Even so, try one if you never had any before because something this bad gives you a lot of appreciation for breweries that do deliver good products all year round."
Worst,Cara Pils,1.2,"Ah, talk about memories of Belgium! Nothing more epitomizes the day-to-day, I-save-all-my-money-for-beer-but-only-buy-the-cheapest existence of an adolescent exchange student than a can of lukewarm Cara-Pils! An exchange student friend of mine brought this back for me from a recent trip back to Liege as a token of our...um...friendship.

I almost laughed as I took the care to pour it into my pint glass, a sign of respect this beer should never be afforded. It's appearance is pale yellow and practically transparent, clear as day. It fizzes like a can of Coke and, if poured a little too hastily, can foam up like a bubble bath of malt-stricken death. In my particular case, I poured slowly enough to keep the foam under control, though it still takes a while to subside (which is, oddly enough for a beer, something you sort of want it to do). Is it even worth mentioning lacing? I didn't think so... A sip is like an assault on the mouth, for lack of a more original metaphor. The carbonation so apparent in the head is no less powerful in the taste, effectively shocking the tongue into submission- bending it over and pulling down its pants to prepare it for the horror to come, so to speak. The taste would be called weak if it wasn't for the sickening malt flavor that coats the palate in a godawful slime that can only be removed by repeatedly brushing your teeth. Hops are nowhere to be found, and are instead replaced by a blatant and offensive alcohol kick that just exacerbates the carbonation... violation.

I was glad to see this beer only for the stomach-churning sentimentality it inspired in me and the pleasure I knew I would derive from writing this review. It's the Belgian college student's 40 of OE, the alcoholic's plastic bottle of Georgi. To my friend's credit, at least he brought me a Rodenbach Grand Cru to sweeten the deal."
Worst,Cara Pils,1.27,"A Cara Pils is a beer drinker to taste the piss ... and one who tells you otherwise is a liar or alcoholics. Cara Pils have no aromas, no flavors and no body but it's cost only about 0.25euros... it's usually a very popular beer in the evenings student where alcohol flows freely."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,1.69,"330 ml bottle, from the n/a shelf at Vinmonopolet Kvadrat. Very pale golden colour, moderate white head. Strong and sickly aroma of carrots boiled far too long, maize baby porridge and unfermented industrial pilsener wort. The flavour is not good, but not totally undrinkable when the beer is cold. At least there are hints of malts and hops."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.35,"From Hipercor. In Teku glass. At lunch, with omelette. It only has slight traces of the typical unpleasantness of 0,0, not bothering much while drinking it. Apart from that, complete dullness"
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.68,"Beer pours a pale, translucent gold, capped by two fingers of loose foam that persists for longer than expected but does ultimately recede to a thin layer and then some islands. A bit of lacing, and a lot of visible carbonation.

Smell is bready, biscuity malt, light cracker. Faint sourness, slightly grassy hops, bitter greens. A touch metallic.

Taste is slightly sour malt, biscuit. Faint hop bitterness, more bitter salad greens, slight metallic twang. Carbonation is high, and the body is quite watery. But at least there is some hop presence here?

I've had worse. It doesn't compete with Krombacher--which I would consider the standard-bearer of NA beers--but it's recognizably beery and not outright offensive. Drink it *ice*-cold from the bottle, and you might even be able to fool your taste-buds into thinking you're drinking an American light lager."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,3.3,"330ml bottle, a single found at my local Superstore, of all places - who knew? Apparently they have broken cases too.

This beer pours a crystal clear, pale golden straw hue, with two fingers of puffy, moderately foamy, and bubbly off-white head, which leaves a decent array of layered deciduous tree lace around the glass as it lazily subsides.

It smells of warm grainy, somewhat pungently cereal-heavy malt (weirdly common for the 'style', it seems), a slight flinty mineral character, and tame earthy, weedy hops. The taste is more of the same - cereal-prominent malt, a certain hard-water essence, and leafy, earthy hops. Simple, but quite beer-like, surprisingly, as if I hadn't played this game before.

The carbonation is average - supportive and a tad peppy - the body an adequate medium weight, and smooth in the most general of senses. It finishes off-dry, the breakfast cereal essence still rather undeniable, the noble hops not altogether interested in the affair by now, leaving us with another version of this foreign dominance unchecked and unheeded at my grocery chain border.

I'd like to opine that this is so obviously an NA beer, but I just can't. The maltiness is just so superior to many of the pale lagers out there - noticeable, enjoyable, and well, not boozy. So why can't a whole lot of the normals get that part right? No offense to Warsteiner - they've no doubt got their shit together, like many of their German kin."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.48,"Slight bitter taste with a strong after taste. Not particularly impressed with a beer that considers itself as the kind you want to drink 'cause life is too short. I didn't find anything that stood out on this brew, maybe if I had tried it out of a bottle it would have been a different experience."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,3.59,"Appearance: Bright and light coloured; yellowish. Pours a one finger pure white head, which dissipates quickly.

Aroma: Hops and a tiny bit of sweet malt. Typical bready and sweet aromas for a non-alcoholic beer. Fresh.

Taste: Mild, hoppy, and a little bit sweet, as expected. Quite refreshing, and the hop flavours are decent. The sweetness is not overwhelming, but I always find it problematic in non-alcoholic beers since there's not enough bitterness and body to contrast with it.

Mouthfeel: Light bodied, medium carbonation.

Overall: Decent for a non-alcoholic beer. Quite refreshing and fresh without too much sweetness."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.51,"I picked up this beer to work on the 104 styles goal. Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to trying an N/A. Most are made by BMC, and I figured that Warsteiner would do better.

The coloring looks really good. It is a bright golden color with really light foam. It leaves some pretty decent lacing on the pilsner glass.

I smell a lot of bright, pilsner flavor in this glass. There seems to be a pretty decent amount saaz hops in this glass.

The flavor is where the beer really falls short. It is all hop and no balance. Then I get a pretty decent amount of dry mouth.

I'm glad I got this style out of the way. Now I can go back to drinking great new styles."
Worst,Warsteiner Premium Fresh,2.18,"Pretty stinky stuff. The skunk and musty hops makes one nausious when blended with the sweet, cake batter, bready notes. Sugary toasted bread with skunk sprayed on it. Clear with hint of yellow, faint soapy head that fades fast and leaves spotty lace. Skunk ruins what could be some nice sweet bready flavors. Drain pour."
Worst,Zima,2.35,"12oz bottle stolen from my uncle's fridge

This has a reputation, and it did not fail that reputation as a memorably bad ""brew"". Basically a sprite-flavored wine cooler, not really a beer or malt liquor except by a loose definition. Fails as a beer and at only 5% you would probably contract diabetes before catching a buzz. And I wasn't brave enough to let this thing warm up to do any close tasting. Ponderous"
Worst,Zima,4.15,"What can I say, If you remember the '80's you weren't there.
This is not a beer so nothing special to say but it's refreshing and got you hammered after a bunch."
Worst,Zima,4.41,"Beautiful crystal clear color with a fizzy white head on top that vanishes quickly. The smell has a sweet citrusy aroma to it reminiscent of 7-Up or Sprite. The taste has a very refreshing citrus flavor to it with a crisp sweet finish. The feel is more on the dry side with an acidic heat in the late finish. Overall, Zima is super nostalgic for me. It reminds me of being in middle school spending nights at a friends house and he would share some of his parents stash with me while we played ECW Wrestling on PS1 and chatted with girls on AIM all night till the sun came up. I wasn't aware at the time but if you get bored with the straight citrus flavor you can drop some Jolly Ranchers up in this and it's like a whole new experience all over again. Welcome back Zima!"
Worst,Zima,1.67,"If you can't say anything nice then don't say anything. I'm not saying anything. I tried this once while on business in Iowa City. The bar owner I had come to know during my two weeks in town, and many trips to his establishment, offered me a six pack of this stuff, saying he couldn't sell much of it. I gladly accepted it then, took it back to my hotel and popped one open. Refer to the first two sentences of this review."
Worst,Zima,2.45,"Man I remember drinking these in English class in high school. Good times. Anyways, pours similar to a can of Sprite, 7up or crystal pepsi. Yeah, that's the appearance of this ""beer"". I dunno, I mean, there are originality points, but then there are drawback points as well in that regard. Maybe its a wash. Aroma was like, nothing. Seltzer water. Could have been some psychosomatic feels making me think I could smell that citrus.

Taste is like a very low alcohol seltzer water with sugar added. Not pulling any lemon or lime flavors out of it like most clear carbonated beverages. Mouth feel isn't anything that smacks of barley. Or hops. This is really straining credulity to assign it the label of beer. With that said, there is nothing horribly tasting about it, it just doesn't really come to mind as something you want to drink when you want a beer. It could have other roles in the drinking world, but doubtful it satiates anyone's desire for a beer (that is of age)."
Worst,Zima,2.25,"A timeless rerelease of a fairly bland citrus alcohol beverage. I found the alcohol content high enough to be helpful, but the taste rather like some kind of flat Sprite. Frankly, I’d rather order emphysema. That’s from “The Simpsons.” 2018/05/22"
Worst,Zima,3.07,"Look: Clearish w/bubbles when shaken.
Smell: Yes. Unable to pinpoint, but, yes, there is smell.
Taste: Sweet alka-selzerish but, sweeter.
Feel: Soft, smooth, bitterless.
Overall: This one's fun to have a few of; to drop an altered flavored candy into and 1st taste the foam then remember that this is not beer. Never was and will never be.
Still, an interesting collection of tastes."
Worst,Zima,1.7,12oz bottle at my a bottle share as a gag. It's crystal clear and highly carbonated. Tastes and smells like alcoholic Sprite. The most interesting aspect was that several women refused to sample because it brought back bad memories of drinking during their youth.
Worst,Zima,2.19,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into an Irish coffee mug. straight-up 7-Up in appearance: crystal clear, lots of carbonation, no head at all. Aromas and flavors of light citrus. Quite sweet, very light in body. This seems to me to be more of an alco-pop than a malt liquor, as the malt character is underwhelming to say the least. A novelty at best, and one not worth bringing back."
Worst,Zima,1.53,"A: You know the 90s...Pepsi Crystal. It must be healthier and more pure.

S: This is 'provocative' in the wrong sense of the word. Elderflower aroma is kind; I'm surprised a sip followed the quaff.

M: I looked like I had sucked on a lemon and just (s)wallowed.

T: Summed up by: ""It's like if you poured Popov into a Smirnoff Ice and called it a mistake.""-SB
Hey, At least I listened to Biggie while drinking this, so nostalgia counts for something overall."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.6,"Another beer from my early days in SE Asia back in the mid 60s. They always had a stockpile of them for us after our missions.
Pours a light gold color with a white head.
Tastes of corn and malt.
As good as I remember."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.71,"Poured from the stubby bottle into a Budweiser shorty sham glass. An honest day's work might take days from the bottle cap message.

Pale to straw colored gold with real nice clarity, and reams of fine carbonation. The head is straight up styrofoam but actually has real decent retention and some staying power. Lingers with a big bright white fine bubbled top off three fingers for just a short enough bit to stay interesting.

Aroma has a real cereal grain flavor, and somewhat muted dextrose corn like sense. There's a whispy like clean quality to this, but doesn't have a sense of big sugar either. Comes off in a somewhat balanced way, but also strangely smells a little like burnt vegetative notes.

Palate is actually charming in some ways. Light bodied definitely wet but holds just enough and doesn't go for a syrupy corn rush either. Palate has a light sweeetness and non existent hop content. Mild sweet corn finish but also a simple clean touch that makes for real easy drinking. Manages to stay away from just enough of the bad qualities enough of mass adjuncts, pappery, watery. syrupy, overly sweet and sugary this isn't.

Fairly good quaffable mass market lager, in fact if this was served even colder it might even be better."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3,"""Best by 8/15/22""; drank 7/10/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through pale yellow appearance.

A rough pour yielded a huge, noisy white head; decent lace.

Corn & mild caramel notes in the nose.

Thin mouthfeel.

Corn & mild caramel flavors.

A bit sweet & not real exciting; it's drinkable, but not one I'll seek out again."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.76,"Out of all of America's commercial adjunct lager this one is one of the better beers next to Miller Highlife, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Lone Star. Alcoholwise it's probably your best choice in this category. Since I'm drinking mine from a can I won't explain every detail but it does have a slightly sweet taste and maybe even a hint of salt at the finish. It has characteristics of a brown ale but real subtle. Smells a bit like sweet corn in a way and is overall an enjoyable beer. Keep in mind that there isnt much of a comparison to craft beers but like someone said in a previous review, adjunct lagers should have their own designated area on Beer Advocate in order for commercial adjunct beers to receive a truer and more accurate rating and review. When compared to craft beer all the beers above suck. They really should be moved into a category of their own even though they are both beers. There's too much of a difference in them. I enjoy some adjunct lagers as much as I do craft beers and it's kinda not fair for all of the adjuncts to be under 70 in the ratings. Only fair to separate them"
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.45,"It's a beer of an unglamorous classification, but it is very enjoyable. Nose of Sweet grains and corn with noticable banana/Isoamyl acetate and crisp refreshing minerality. Taste is sweet and very satisfying with a mediocre aftertaste, not too metallic. Malt flavor is thin but it has some refreshing lager character in it. For anyone that knows the state of Colorado well, this brew is oddly well adjusted for its home. The praries in the east, mountains in the middle and high desert in the west all go nicely with this beer. Best of the macrobrews that I've had."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.68,"Pros. Sweet for a regular lager to start a sip and almost hits a brown ale to finish.
Fairly priced.
Inside of twist off caps are Fortune Cookie like messages.

Cons. Not sold in most bars in NH."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.08,"I haven’t had this beer in decades and remember during grad school from Michigan to Ohio to buy some when it made it to that state. Had this beer at a little dive blues bar in Austin this evening. It get a few points just for old time sake.

First it was served in a squat brown bottle so for looks I am going by the bottle. It was fine, nothing outstanding. Hard to get a good wiff, but there was a hint of corn and grass. The taste was not bad. Corny and grassy, but there was some pleasant fruit notes as well. I think the beer has a nice feel for an adjunct. Overall, it is fine for the style and, well, it is a big anniversary for Smokey and the Bandit. Very few beers star in a movie."
Worst,Coors Banquet,4,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light golden color with a moderately strong white head. SRM of 6. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of pale malts, barley, corn adjuncts. Pale and somewhat crisp.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts, a bready adjunct flavor through the middle. Finishes with more adjunct & bready sweetness.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Decent carbonation. A somewhat bready mouthfeel. (4.00)

Compared to House Premium Crafted Lager 5/23/22: Pours a lighter color, Milder aromas. More adjuncts. Less honeycrisp and cracker. Similar body, but dryer.

Overall: A decent lager here. It definitely still has the adjunct flavors, but also more of a breadiness than other light/adjunct lagers. The mouthfeel is quite nice, but with the flavor of Coors light. Not as much corn adjuncts as Miller. A decent offering here. (Rating:"
Worst,Coors Banquet,4.22,"Recently I found myself on a journey to see if I could find any adjunct lager that could displace PBR as my favorite. Having tried now ~25 of the style, there are only a couple that meat that criteria. MHL and this one. The look is not terribly impressive, with a cap of foam that disappears during a blink. But the aromas and flavors are not only not off-putting, but downright inviting to me. Lots of sweet malty corn dominate with an undetectable hop presence that must balance this perfectly as it finishes very clean and begs for another sip. Yum."
Worst,Coors Banquet,2.58,"I feel like there needs to be a separate category for these US adjunct beers. Comparing a Coors to a craft DIPA is, as the old saying goes, apples to oranges. As a craft beer lover, I still have an appreciation for beers I grew up watching our grandfathers, uncles, and dads drink. I have come to enjoy Coors Banquet in cans again. Much more enjoyable than Budweiser for me. Not a fan of Coors Light, but when I’m mowing the lawn, hanging by the pool, I’ll take. Coors “Yellowjacket” any day!"
Worst,Coors Banquet,2.88,"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. Somehow it fit.

The look on the pour is at first enticing until it quickly becomes what it really is. When I cracked the can head almost exploded out of the top and as I poured almost 2 fingers of head formed. That quickly recedes fast enough that I can get the whole pint into a pint glass right up to the rim without spilling. Color is a tad darker than just pale straw with a steady flow of small bubbles wandering their way to the surface.

Aroma is what you'd expect. Dominated by lager yeast and skunked hops, there is a hint of crackery malts peeking through but it's hard to enjoy when the hops have essentially gone rancid in this one. Not as bad as the Miller genuine draft I had but pretty bad.

The taste is slightly better with actual malt sweetness and some breadiness, and a lot less fermentation character, however the offness is still there. Its drinkable but not crisp. It's honestly almost sweet.

The feel is what is nailed here. Strong bite from carbonation but enough head comes back to give it decent body and the feel is honestly refreshing. Not bad when you look back it pairs with the malty sweetness quite well.

But overall, you go in to take another sip and are reminded that something is wrong here. Weather it's an old can which is weird seeing as it's a cheap single in lower income area, but who knows. Maybe I could get a better coors and I remember a better coors but this is just off."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.3,"Coors original, my all time favorite cheap beer. You can find it anywhere and it's like $20 for a pack of 30. No craft beer can compare to that price point. It's best had from a bottle. The mouth feel is bubbly and light. Taste is good ol American lager flavor. Don't hate it because it's been around forever; give it a try."
Worst,Coors Banquet,3.12,"12 oz stubby bottle with a 23 May 2022 bottling date stamped on the neck.

Appearance. Clear with high clarity.

Clean and well balanced but a bit watery and overly mild."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.89,"Had with a meal in Germany, as there were no ""real"" beers in the house and I had never tried an NA beer before. Frankly it's a bit bizarre and there's definitely something missing taste-wise. That being said, it's not bad at all. I just have no desire to drink another one."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.63,"Pours a crystal clear golden color. Thick 3-4 finger sudsy white head forms on the beer before dissipating. Thin layer of velvety foam remains on the top of the beer. Aroma has notes of sweet grains, a slight skunkiness, light herbal hops. Again, its very reminiscent of a Beck's.

Taste follows the nose with notes of sweet grainy malts, a moderate skunkiness that becomes more pronounced as it warms up. There is a very light wortiness to the profile, but its very subtle. Feel is light, crisp, easy drinking. Bright carbonation.

This is a solid NA version of the regular beer."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.77,"This is my entry-level NA. I won't purchase Sharp's, O'Douls, or Coors Edge.
If Beck's NA is all the store or restaurant has then I'll go with it. It can pair okay with most foods because it doesn't have an overwhelming taste profile."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.62,"Pours clear, gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is cereal grain and white sugar. Light body, moderate carbonation, sweet. Good for an old school macro style non alcoholic beer. Very clean and sessionable."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.46,"Pours a translucent pale yellow with a finger of white foam. Aroma is dank, like walking into a backwoods, dispensary dank. Aside from the dank, is light resiny hops and pale malts, but really it's just dank. Flavor profile is, you guessed it, hella dank. It's dank from top to bottom, with a little resiny hops and pale malts for some extra depth. Mouth feel is crisp with thin consistency leading to a refreshing sip. Overall, dank can't be understated here, but otherwise, a refreshing glass of NA beer.

Served in a chilled pint from a bottle."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.83,"Pours a clear transparent straw colour with very small head and minimal lacing.

Smell is pretty unremarkable, slightly malty but not much else there.

Tastes of slight malts and skinniness but the taste is very faint. Tastes like a very watered down version of their regular beer.

Not a great NA beer. If you’re skimping on the alcohol I’d reach for a higher quality de alcolized brew."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,1.27,"Poured from a bottle - pale yellow straw color with quickly dissipating fluffy white head leaving moderate frosty lacing. Looks like fizzy yellow beer.Nose is mildly skunky with a faint hint of some unidentifiable smell-moldy grass clippings or decomposing vegetables or spoiled fermenting grain? Taste is diluted,watery and skunky -a weak attempt at capturing what beer tastes like. I don't know why anyone would drink this. Terrible."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.17,"It a straw color and very transparent with a decent head. On the nose, it is malty with a sweet bready note ans some hop notes. Tastewise it is quite sweet but not cloyingly so with spicier hops, although not too noticeable. The feel is thick and foamy, very satisfying. Overall, it is rewarding."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.41,"Look: Clear gold with some rising carbonation bubbles. Half a finger of fizzy white head that quickly dissipates.

Smell: Horrible, awful, skunked. The green bottle makes this virtually inevitable.

Taste: Extremely mild but extremely sweet malt. Except for a mild bitterness without flavor that crops up a few seconds after swallowing,I would be surprised if a hop ever went near this bottle.

Mouthfeel: The one good part of this beer. Full and smooth with high carbonation.

Overall: Recovering alcoholics can choose something else."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.44,"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is full of malts, sweet. Taste is of malts, grains, light sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall it has a little more flavor and body than I expect from this style."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.98,"12 oz bottle

Pours clear light golden, sugar white head dissipates to a lacing.

Aroma is of straw and dry cereal grains.

Flavor is of grassy malts at first, then sweeter cereal malts, almost fruity.

Light body, stinging carbonation.

Decent for a n/a. Drinks easy enough. The taste is kind of artificial, but not terrible. It passes as a beer."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.74,"(12 oz bottle, best before end 05.2020; purchased cold single... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: crystal-clear, pale gold liquid, light dusting of speckled sediment floating; another picture-perfect, craggy bulge of frothy foam... drapes of lace all over; thick collar and partial cap holds

S: first impression is a maibock - one with blue hyssop overtones... I was hoping it would smells like Beck's regular, but it does have a subtle emphasis on malt with the alcohol obviously greatly reduced... hmm, almost smells like a pils; relatively potent aromas at any rate

T: Bavarian soft pretzel underbelly with a humming static of spicy herbal hop and phenols buzzing atop... by the second sip, a lot more malt swells; the aftertaste has a doughy pretzel note, almost with a hint of salt(?!)... full-flavored attack; maybe a tad starchy sweet on the back end... malty dough and subtle bitterness linger for awhile; relatively dry

F: frothy texture covering up the sluggish, weak worty flow... does finish with a dry fade, but lips and inner cheeks be smacking

O: interesting - I can sort of taste Beck's in this... noticeable differences between this and the Heineken 0.0 I just tried; way more malty malt with this one... not all that bad, but it almost tastes like the malt is waiting to be converted to ethanol (1477)"
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.71,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 3/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of cardboard-like aromas/flavors from the NA process, but not overwhelming. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Overall this is a nice NA pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and pretty refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for low ABV. Nice clean pils malt showcase, with great earthy noble hop presence/balance. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. One of the better NA beers I have had."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.3,"On medication that says not to drink alcohol, so I thought I'll try a .03% beer. Two of these beers is like taking one sip of regular beer. I've had non-alcohol beer once before and thought it tasted horrible. This taste like the real thing and that what I was hoping for. If I was rating this solely as an NA beer based on other NA beers I've tried it would have a higher rating, but as a beer not taking in consideration alcohol that seems about right."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.21,"Crystal clear body, golden, with very little noticeable carbonation but leaving a billowy, sticky head. Sweet aroma primarily. The taste mirrors the aroma; corn syrup sweetness; honeyed grains. Medium body; treacly sweet.

A nasty, brutish non-alcohol beer that is suitable only for those who relish the flavor of sweetened corn syrup. Water is a much better substitute if one wants to refrain from partaking in real beer. Cloying sweet from all angles."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,4.4,"If you like alcoholic Beck beer, you will like this.

Look:
Like alcoholic Beck beer.

Smell:
Like alcoholic Beck beer.

Taste:
Like alcoholic Beck beer. Maybe slightly more skunky at times.

Feel:
Like alcoholic Beck beer.

Overall:
One of the most solid near-beers on the market. Fun fact, Beck was one of the first near-beer manufacturers during prohibition. Maybe that's why they make such a solid product today."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.48,"Poured from green 12 fluid ounce bottle into glass. Best by marking on label is '08.2018'.
Straw colored body, extremely clear, with picturesque carbonating bubbles rising to the surface. Persistent white, fluffy cap. Good coverage of lacing.
Aroma is subtle, light malt and skunky.
Taste includes malt and hops, but, of course, is missing the alcohol aspect. Skunky taste too.
Light to medium mouth feel, with good carbonation.
Good choice for style. Mostly tastes like beer."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,4.56,"I think many of these reviews are from people who regularly drink alcoholic beer and haven't really sampled the various non-alcoholic kinds on the market. I am a beer lover, and at times in my life have been required to stop alcohol consumption (during the course of 4 pregnancies). During my first pregnancy, this was extremely miserable for me because the available beers were alternate versions of the beers i already didn't enjoy at all. Beck's non-alcoholic is a breakthrough! It actually has a taste that is like regular beer. It tastes very similar to beck's with alcohol. If you enjoy a skunky smell and flavor (as I do), or light German style beer, then this is the non-alcoholic beer you want to choose!"
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,2.1,"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at the World of Beer in Pooler, GA. The appearance is a pale urine color and this was the highlight of this whole ordeal. The the aroma and taste were ""skunk"" driven. Not a good experience at all."
Worst,Beck's Non-Alcoholic,3.36,"I've read some reviews comparing this to an alcoholic beer..which makes no sense to me. These non-alcoholic beers are in an entirely different bracket. They just don't taste like real beer. That said, I'll review it against other non-alcoholic beers.
I find it not too bad. I've actually got to the point where I look forward to having one. Some other are quite dreadful, but I find this one less so. It does taste like a beer..once you've forgotten what a real beer tastes like.
And it's not a low-alcohol beer according to the label. It's a zero alcohol beer. (0.0%)"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.53,"The local bottle shop near me stock some of these strong European lagers, which are good on a Friday night, when you want to get your buzz on, and not think too hard about the present, future, or past. They've started stocking this one, so thought I'd pick up a can and give it a go.

Look: Clear, very bubbly golden beer, looking like a classic Australian adjunct lager, rather than a typical pale Euro lager. Frothy white head that has more important places to be than my glass by the way it's disappearing as I type this.

Smell: Strong alcohol whiff on the nose, bitter grassy hops, somewhat sour on the nose, biscuit malt. Smells like a hangover in the making.

Taste: Sweet syrupy goo. It's like they've poured a lot of simple syrup and mixed it with straight alcohol. Struggling to find anything positive about the flavour, might be some hop extract in there somewhere, but if it is they've mixed with with simple syrup and turned it into a hop cordial.

Feel: Smooth, not overly carbonated, but sickly sweet.

Overall: 20th review, and this is the first one I'm proper regretting. I've had OJ strong, and from memory that's more palatable, this is just beer cordial. I look on the can and sure enough, it lists hop extract, and glucose syrup. 1-2 cans may get you buzzed, but heck, I'd rather drink a 6 pack of an average Aussie adjunct lager than force myself to down this. Better drink it ice cold, because once it warms up, it's going to be completely undrinkable.

In a word: Yuck!"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,2.43,"If your on holiday in europe and you want quick buzz this is your beer.It looks good price reasonable and tastes ok.Def the pick of the strong cans.Obvs
big supermarket will provide better but not always option."
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,5,"One of the greatest beer I ever drank. Only two and you'll have the best night of your life. The first sip can be weird but you can't stop drinking it. It's really cheap and the can is beautiful. About the taste, well, it gets better sip after sip ! Just try it and stop consider it like a low beer, only for homeless people. Trust me guys !"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.43,"Blond in color with a frothy white head that lasts several minutes before breaking. 2.25

Smell is sweet malts, caramel and breads along with a tin can smell. 1.75

Taste is remarkably sweet given the style. The sweet malts overpower just about anything else. 1.25

Feel is lightish and the carbonation is medium. The metallic smell from earlier is now an unfavorable aftertaste. 1.25

Another giant cup of nope. I don't know how people can drink this beer. Sweet malty mess with a metal aftertaste? No thanks. 1.25"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,1.65,"This heavy and boozy beverage delivers a 8.0% Abv in your face. A lot on the sweet side, this one presents some grainy notes but never shows any hop presence"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,2.18,"Pours a nice, clear golden body with lots of soapy head frothing at the top, looking very appealing from the get-go. The scent isn't so bad either, with sharp malt characteristics and noble hops on the nose. The palate is what gets you - a generic lager at the forefront of the tongue transforms into a soapy bitterness towards the back, with nothing more than pure alcohol being detected here. Really drinks like dishwater in general. Awful beer."
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,3,"Color: light amber, clear. The head of a white, fine-bubble, high and medium durable.
Aroma: hints of malt with hops, floral and fruity.
Taste: malty, bread and herbal notes. some fruit in the background alcohol.
Gentian dry hop. The loading medium toward low. After heating, unfortunately, comes more alcohol."
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,3.66,"An interesting beer form Holland. This 8.6 % ABV have a really nice feeling in mouth. The taste is not too strong and it is fun to drink.

The can I had it is 500 ml can bought in Canada NB.

The color Is a nice clear yellow SRM of 2.

This beer is a must have again."
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,3,"From Carrefour Huelva. In Bavaria glass. Watching Sons of Anarchy 7x07. Sweet, Not like in belgians but more like in caramel. Not bad, not amazing but can be drinked quick even with its ABV"
Worst,Bavaria 8.6 Original,2.08,"Fab...8.6. This is drink of choice in Paris for many of the homeless fellas. And me also tonight...

It is basically a beer called a name that is its alcohol content, by Dutchies. The crazy mofos...how creative...

Look is rather see-through and piss like. Fizz lasts about the same time as piss also.

Aroma is like a pub at 5AM combined with ash-trays.

Taste..? Definitely no balance between the flavours and alcohol. Too much carbon dioxide. And ash tray. I am certain that someone has emptied ash trays in this beer...it was not me.

Though is it bad or really bad..? It's close to really bad, though I shall still drink it all anyway. Though the taste is actually better than the 5 AM cigarette butt aroma.

Would I drink if I was homeless..? For sure. There is fuck all else to do and I probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of Chimnay Bleu.

Also it seems to have made me cough. Seriously, do not buy unless you are homeless or like me and are testing it to warn other people.

Instead, have a Polish Mocjne or Belgian beer

And I do not smoke in case you were wondering...neither has my beer chalise ever been used as an ashtray, until now

Still, I prefer this to Kronenbourg, 4X, Fosters, and some of the other shite UK lagers, as it is stronger and will put me into the higher dimension quicker..."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.74,Smells slightly malty. Pours clear light gold. Taste of light malt and with a hint of lemon. This has a crisp clean flavor but doesn’t really inspire me to purchase another.
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.51,"Purchased as a 12-pack of cans from Ingles for $12.83. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Pours a clear goldenrod, with a minimal head that goes away fairly quickly. Lacing is okay, but not ideal.
S - Miscellaneous grain, with some hay notes. A bit of a sweet aroma, like how Budweiser smells a bit sweet.
T - Nose matches flavor exactly. Nothing else going on, really.
F - Light-bodied, with decent carbonation. Crisp and refreshing, for sure. Poundable.
O - Look, anyone purchasing this one is doing so because of the drinkability and mild flavor. It does its job well in those regards. It's objectively a pretty average brew, but I don't hate it. It's good to relax with on a hot day like today. That being said, it's nearly indistinguishable from Tecate. Not really worth a try, but it's a good refreshment."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.58,"On tap.

Light gold pour with a good ring of white lacing. Definite adjunct corn type of malt aroma going on with some light honey notes. Taste follows with sweet malt and hardly any hop presence whatsoever. Light medium body and finishes on the sweeter side. Overall? No thanks."
Worst,Landshark Lager,1.89,"Unassuming, Uninteresting, Unremarkable - in fact UN in every possible way, this bland insipid adjunct lager should be a hit with Americans the land over. Enjoy!"
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.94,"This one pours a clear golden yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like slightly sweet malt, and a bit of sweet graininess.

As expected, there’s basically nothing to this. It’s just sweet and slightly crisp, grainy and maybe a little corn-like. On the beach when it’s hot, it’s acceptable, but you’re not gonna give it a second thought.

This is light bodied, very drinkable, and relatively smooth on the back end.

This isn’t really meant to be dissected. It’s not that good, but that also doesn’t really matter in the end."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.53,"I bought a 6 pack of bottles 355ml at 4.6%.
It was bought at the LCBO in Ontario Canada brewed here in Canada in Waterloo Ontario.
Poured into glass with a 1 finger head.
Taste is very plain style lager it's actually easy to drink on a hot day ice cold is best for this type of beer.
It's kinda like a Corona have to drink it ice cold or its no good .
Overall an ok easy drinking lager .
Cheers"
Worst,Landshark Lager,3.2,"Clear urine yellow color. Small fizzy head with no real retention.

Aroma of corn sweetness, slight cracker malt, a bit of hay and grass.

Sweet corn upfront, grainy and crackery malt, very subtle hay, perhaps a drop of lemon.

Light mouthfeel but well carbonated and not too watery.

Eh, it's a decent light corn lager. Perfectly acceptable for the outdoors in hot weather. Comparable to Corona and Dos Equis and whatnot."
Worst,Landshark Lager,5,Exceptional light summer beer super refreshing after a day of doing yard work or a leisure Saturday afternoon. If you like corona youll love landshark its enjoyable without lime
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.06,What you'd expect - watery tasting Corona type of knock off for having on vacation when you want something with very little alcohol. You're not drinking it for the taste.
Worst,Landshark Lager,1.76,"It was on special for 20 oz in a souvenir cup… served with a lime. I’m on vacation at the beach, so why not? It was a pale and an off-putting shade of yellow. Smelled like corn and carbonation. The first sip was sweet and kinda funky, like it was already a little skunked (even though it was on tap). Moderate carbonation but it was going flat quickly. Had to slam it. Aftertaste was not necessarily a pleasant one. Won’t be buying this for the fridge at home. Good enough for the price but I assume it’s because they’re trying to get rid of it. Better than most “light beers” but that’s not saying anything."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.41,"One of those American adjuncts that you need to drop quickly because the corn takes over if it's not ice cold.

Look: clear straw; almost piss-yellow.

Smell: grains—and not particularly prominent.

Taste: classic adjunct. Some hop presence, but the corn lingers, particularly as the beer warms.

Feel: relatively substantial for an ""island lager"".

Overall: drink fast on a particularly hot tropical day and it's passable."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2,"Tried this because I was a tourist in Destin Harbour's Margaritaville - a real schmuckfest.
Served in clear (dumbass) bottle with lime wedge (with stale contaminated browning peel!)
SLight yellow pee color, slight corn smell, slight corn and lime taste. Semi fizzy for a few minutes (don't take longer than 3-5 minutes or it goes flat as a popcorn fart, and smells the same).
Overall, not worth the money at any price, and a disgrace to Jimmy Buffet. Avoid, unless you're a kid who is sneaking it."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.84,"16oz can into a pint glass. Freshness dating hard to understand.

Crystal clear pale golden yellow body. Initial big white head quickly shrinks to a thin ring and faint covering. No lacing.

Hardly any aroma at all. Faintly sweet malt.

On tasting, well, there isn't much of that either. Lightly apple and a little sweet.

Mouth closer to thin than medium. A little sharp on the finish.

Overall, pretty bland, on the other hand, no nasty aftertaste either."
Worst,Landshark Lager,1.96,"This is a very sweet beer, like cloyingly sweet. And for $24 a case (here in PA), not worth it. I can get a 30-pack of Hamm's for $14, and it tastes so much better. This beer is all about marketing and branding. Avoid if you can."
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.49,"The first time I tried Landshark was a couple summers ago on a beach in Wilmington. Really loved it then, because it was hot as hell on the beach and a cold can of beer hit the spot! Back then, I compared it to a lighter version of Corona, as it had a bit of a lemony -limey taste to it, without adding one to it, like you do to Corona.
Now, I’m trying it again and it’s still good...it’s nice and cold & easy to drink and still has that lemony after-taste, which gives it a summertime appeal, but it is pretty thin in taste. The ABV is 4.6 so it gets you where you wanna go, put it isn’t much in flavor. If I had to choose, I’d go with a Mexican lager like Modelo Especial, but it is quite easy to drink & doesn’t have any negative flavors or skunkiness...it’s just a little....thin? Watery? Oh well. I still think Jimmy Buffett is a great singer & songwriter, so there’s that. And the can art & color is “beachy”!! So 2.75?"
Worst,Landshark Lager,1.1,Have you ever wondered if your liver and bladder work? This beer will answer that question. If Corona had a filthy second cousin this would be it. This beer is drinkable but that’s about it. It’s yellow. The end.
Worst,Landshark Lager,2.87,"Clear, bright yellow/gold appearance with a medium size white head and minimal lacing. Muted aroma ; some sweet maltiness. Clean, mild, moderately sweet along with some adjuncts. Hops are kept to the bare minimum. Light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with a short lived finish. Really not terrible for a mass produced pale lager but not worth a second round. Here at the local watering hole, they just added green dye to the keg for St Paddy's Day. Won't rate that mug."
Worst,Landshark Lager,4.69,"it's smooth, and sort of an apple or pear high note...so sorta like drinking weak fruit jelly, on a cracker
i must say, i have been avoiding this beer, and now it's one of my favorites"
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.18,"I'm not sure I've given this good a score to a beer that everyone else (per the BA average) felt was so Poor.
But I must say, this beer did its job: refreshing after 90 minute flight delays in Chicago and a bumpy bus ride from Calgary airport into the Rockies.

More important than my review is my remark that I find it funny the brewer calls this an IPA (I presume in the British tradition since Nova Scotia is close geographically and spiritually) and BA has 697 reviews with American Blonde styling. It also should be noted that UnTappd averages this as a 3 rating and BA's average is 2.63. Something screwy going on here since I find BA usually .25 above UnTappd's average. Not to quibble; but remember beer is to be enjoyed first and analyzed second.

And since Alexander Keith is the ""Pride of Nova Scotia"", they deserve better than average Overall Hugs from me. I went on their website and they are genuine for 200 years."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3,"12 Oz bottle. Pours golden with white head. Aroma is of sweet fruit and bready malt. Body is medium and crisp. Floral hops, bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Medium dry finish. Ok brew."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.34,"People don't understand that this is not the English IPA first brewed by Alexander Keith, in Halifax back in 1820 (the first IPA brewed in North America). Until Anheuser-Busch got their claws into it, this was a heavily-hopped, all malt (no corn) mash IPA. Now, it is a weak-flavoured, lightly-hopped, 5% ABV Blonde lager, which meets none of the criteria for an IPA. This is not the beer I drank at university, not even a pale (forgive the pun) imitation. It is thin, light, with no lacing, and a taste typical of Anheuser-Busch swill. Might as well be drinking Bud Light (but no one really drinks that, it's just an urban legend, just like the notion that there are people who actually drink Moxie). This was my go-to beer back many decades ago, but now, I wouldn't touch it."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,1,So I rated this as an IPA. Much like if someone showed you a cow and asked you to rate it as a horse. So as an IPA this is terrible. As a lager it is good.
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,4.7,"All the complaints about wanting this beer to be an IPA or I was tricked needs to understand this isn't a real IPA. Hell this was one of the first mainstream ""IPA's"" out there. It's brewed like an IPA and was supposed to make the journey to INDIA and ferment but instead it just gots sold in Nova Scotia and became the standard beer. Not reaching that fermentation it doesn't hit the same as a real IPA buts boy does it do the trick and many a nights where you just come home reeking of this fine working mans beer. Stops comparing it to sierra nevada IPA its in the class with the beers that put hair on your chests like miller lite and coors lite."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.29,"I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario 473ml at 5%.
my can was very fresh the letter E which stands for May 2021 brewed .
poured a 2finger head into glass that was leaving a lace as you drink it.
I expected more sweetness when I see India pale ale on the can but it's not that sweet at all .
overall it's an easy drinking beer more like a lagered ale then a IPA beer to me .
cheers."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.29,"Beer tastes like lager and apple.

If you were to drink this at a bar, it would taste like a bad beer.

I am whelmed with this beer and the facilities that it gives me."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.5,"When I was on my first date with my ex we went to a rotating restaurant. He said we're there for a beer and we're going on a scavenger hunt. This was our first and last date in the 2 years that we were together. I asked the waitress what beers were on tap, and she named 15 types and I just said Alexander Keiths. My ex's eyes lit up and he said that his eyes lit up. Later he told me that that was one of the moments he knew he loved me. He's a douchebag so that shows this beers quality. Left a sour taste in my mouth, even though the beer was not sour. 5 Smirnoff Ices/10"
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.27,"Rated as an IPA (not a blonde lager that it truly is)

Bit of a scam to call this an IPA. Nothing IPA about it
Its a half decent beer but it is not an IPA

No lacing, no head. Just a bit better than a Coors light"
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.65,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of carbonation. It poured with a finger high frothy white head that died down a bit but never completely faded away.
S: Faint aromas of sweet malt extracts and caramel are preset in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell and is a bit sweet with hints of caramel-like flavors. No bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and clean on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer seems to be very watered down for an IPA and has more of a mouthfeel that I would expect from a Euro Pale Lager than a beer in this style. The smell and taste also seem to be muted.

Serving type: can"
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,1.05,water with coloring in it taste bland boring a poor excuse for IPA or any other beer but still in the poor beer list there is always better beer out there.
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.53,Not an IPA. At first I thought the waitress brought over the wrong beer. Eerily similar to a Bud heavy. I enjoyed it at the time but it may have been because I was parched rather than because of its taste. Wouldn’t recommend.
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,1.67,"Pretty bad. I took a sip and said ""this is an IPA?"" No body to it, slight corn and citrus taste, getting nothing on the finish. This is the kind of beer you give your friends who like to pound Budweiser but want to try something with a different label. Probably good for washing down hot wings."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.32,"Definitively not an IPA. Light industrial commercial beer with preservatives taste.
Not impressed.
Tried it on tap (draft) in a bar. It tastes better and more crispy."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.13,"This to me, does not feel like an IPA. It's sweet, over carbonated (for an IPA), and metallic. I understand it's no craft beer - but to say this is an IPA is a lie. It might be a good beer to get drunk on, or to start to move into different types of beers if you drink ""average"" beers. A positive is the can looks good!"
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,3.09,"This was a 341 ml bottle. I've had this beer previously on a business trip to Ottawa. This one was free at a reception and I would not drink it under other circumstances. It is malty, a little sweet, and really tastes nothing like an IPA."
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,4.17,Alex came to play with his new hops. Subbed Galena with bramling cross and brewers gold I'm guessing. Seems more like an English or Belgian pale now. Very smooth. Not an IPA but smooth.
Worst,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,2.99,"I agree with others here that this is not an IPA. More like a light lager. Pale yellow colour with strong lace. I don't detect much out of hops or malts in the aromas or flavours. Just a decent tasting, non-bitter, low carbonated, smooth beer. Pas plus que ca. I know along with Moosehead, Keith's is the pride of the Maritimes (great place to visit!) so I'll just raise a glass to it."
Worst,Stroh's,3.5,"I get what others are saying, for the style this really isn't bad. Its real cheap at least but definitely not ""piss water"" as some would say. Craft breweries have packaged and shipped way worse products that this one."
Worst,Stroh's,3.64,"I will always be confused when fellow reviewers give these adjuncts abnormally low reviews. You are comparing against the style, not what you think makes you look like a cool beer reviewer. This particular brew is perfectly fine for the style."
Worst,Stroh's,2.74,"This beer was the big boy on the block when I was in high school and first time in the service. Drank a lot of this at that time and liked it. Now not so much but it would be better than nothing, I guess."
Worst,Stroh's,3.85,Has a nice slight floral hop to it. Similar to Hamm's not in taste but in character. It's not your average mass produced AAL that tastes like wet cardboard but has a flavor that makes you look forward to the next can.
Worst,Stroh's,2.79,"12oz can enjoy by date Oct 24, 2022 into a wooden shoe. Wooden shoe?
L: Pours bright light yellow with big bubbles and a lightly soapy bright white head that falls fast. Carbo retention is fair. Light lacing.
S: Light malts, grains, gentle white bread, light caramel.
T: Subtle bitterness, light corn, grains, a light & pleasant grassy overtone.
F: Relatively soft & light bodied mouthfeel with a clean, medium length moderately drying finish.
O: As an iconic American adjunct lager, this beer has a nice balance overall. It is lighter in nature, slightly crisp and is alright in it's style. Drink it ice cold. Very crushable."
Worst,Stroh's,3.48,"Poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, pale medium golden color with lots of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a fluffy looking white head that's initially well over an inch thick when first served. After a few minutes, it settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer surface foam. Good lacing here too. Not a bad look at all. Aromas of some bready malts some herbal and floral notes that I assume are the hop aroma. The taste is pretty much the same, w/ some bready malts followed by floral, maybe some slight hints of corn and or rice, and herbal notes w/ slight hop bitterness. No bad tasting adjunct off-flavors or awful metallic off-flavors here. The flavor, while not great or even that prevalent by any means, seems to suit this beer just fine for what it is. Certainly one of the better tasting beers of this style that I've had. It doesn't even start tasting terrible as it warms up a bit. Has a crisp, yet smooth, light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in the way a beer of this style should be. Has a clean finish and decent aftertaste. Not too shabby, but not great to me either. This beer is exactly what it is trying to be. Refreshing on a warm summer night here in Cleveland, OH.

Worst,Stroh's,3.33,Not the Stroh's of old. I was disappointed in how it had changed. I have been looking for this brand for about a decade and finally found it an hour from home. Once past my disappointment I rated the beer I was drinking. Nothing much different from any of the others in its class. It is a good drinkable beer when you want just a plain beer. There are plenty of others in this category that I don't have to travel to get. I will still buy it when I see it for a change in the fridge. It does have a little uniqueness but not enough to go out of my way for.
Worst,Stroh's,4,"Stroh's was the first beer I ever tasted back in 1973. Of course, your first ever beer of any brand leaves little to be desired. I tried many beers but I always came back to Stroh's. It had a smooth mellow taste that I could not find with any other beer.
Now, today (7/23/21) I was finally able to find the ""new"" Strohs (been looking for 2 years to find a retailer within a days drive) and I hoped for the best. I'll have to admit, I was hoping for that Stroh's beer of the past to be resurrected but I was disappointed. Then I focused on the Stroh's beer in front of me and I found it to be an extremely well balanced brew. I gave it 4's across the board because it's deserving of that. It's better than 95% of what's out there. Bring back the old tried and true Stroh's and I will give it 5's across the board! In the mean time, I will continue to drink the Stroh's thats in front of me.
Southwest Virginia Stroh Lover"
Worst,Stroh's,3.51,I got a cube (30pck) of this beer from my local meijer store . It poured a clear golden with fizzy white head to start which dissipated quickly and left zero lace.. the scent had grain notes.. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with typical grain flavor. The mouthfeel was lighter in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a fine beer.....it gets a bad rap....
Worst,Stroh's,3.55,"12oz can stamped AUG 3120 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 4.5% ABV. The can is now blue again and labeled as Classic. Also states the Stroh Brewery Milwaukee, WI, which is just wrong, but I digress. The beer pours bright straw yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes rather slowly for a budget AAL and leaves a fluffy ring and some lacing. The aroma is mild, corny and grainy in nature. The taste is semisweet, corny, with a hint of movie theater popcorn and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and an undry finish. Overall, good AAL. Could be a lot better with a few more days of lagering to let the yeast finish it's work, but a good value at $18/30 pack."
Worst,Stroh's,4.5,Great American Lager! One of the best traditional brews in our history! I buy it regularly and still enjoy it. Much better than the average American gas station beers.
Worst,Stroh's,3.77,"Pours a dark golden straw with a thin white head.
Sweet grain smell with light malt
Grain and barley come together well for this lager. Much better than colors, bud light and other Aal’s"
Worst,Stroh's,3.83,"(12 oz can - Stroh's American Lager, JAN0620; purchased cold single at SL... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: brilliantly-clear, yellow-amber liquid; loose, fizzy, foam sponge on pour, crumbles quick... razor thin collar remains, only a couple tiny boogers of lace

S: relatively peppery and toasty on its leading edge, with a note of (corn) syrup lingering in the back... after a minute or two, a bit of spicy, desiccated lemon peel hop pokes out... overall intensity fairly weak

T: again, a bit of bitter hoppiness up front?, with toasty grain and subtle burnt corn notes dominating its dry finish... malt moves forward as it goes... more of a robust grainy punch than a typical AAL - in fact, it really just tastes like a drier, toned-down craft Bo'Pils... spicy, Saaz(?) bitterness lingers awhile, lovely!

F: delicate sizzle, but no bite... bit more body and residual drag than expected, bordering on malt liquor?... cut finish, spicy warmth humming, well-tailored attack

O: I can't recall ever having encountered this before, had to grab one... is this a reinvention or alternate recipe released under the Stroh's name?... wish I would've known - would enjoy regularly having at least a sixer of this on hand (1555)"
Worst,Stroh's,3.67,"( Original Fire Brewed )Loved the Original Fire Brewed Stroh's ..drank a river of it with friends late 70's while attending U of Michigan ---that's all anyone drank
Cany you still purchase the Original Fire Brewed Stroh's ? if so where ?"
Worst,Stroh's,2.55,Wanted to like this. I like the packaging and can design. I also like the concept of old brands. High carbonation. Plain corn beer. Would choose a Budweiser over this.
Worst,Stroh's,2.75,"The beer I was weaned on. Drank this from the time I was 15 until I graduated from college. All the bars in the town I grew up in in Ohio had this on tap. Now obviously, this is not the same beer, back then it was brewed by Stroh's out of Detroit, not by Pabst. Do not know what it is like now, and I have no interest in finding out. I am not a fan of Pabst products, and if it ain't the original fire brewed beer I knew, I don't want it"
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.61,"330 ml can, bought in Tenerife. Pale golden colour, decent head. Sweetish fruity and grassy aroma, notes of maize (corn) too. Flavour is watery and ""neutral"" with some tolerable hops in the finish. Acceptable as a thirstquencher, but not much more."
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.59,"This beer is mocked throughout Spain, and rightly so. Only tolerable when drunk ice cold on a blistering hot afternoon in Andalusía. As soon as it starts to warm, even a tad, it becomes sweet & sickly. It labels itself as a pilsner. Hmm. A pilsner with no hop character at all. Poor.

Makes a decent base for a shandy though."
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.72,"surprised this doesnt have better ratings, everyone always seems to take things out of context, or at least thats my assumption on a lot of global lagers like this, i mean against all beer yeah its not a standout, but against euro pale types its solid, and against much of the rest of the spanish lager scene, its quite strong. see its more a pils than a classic pale lager, more grain character without the sweetness, more crisp at the end, some bittering hops in play, and overall a fantastic texture thats dry, uplifting, almost nitro feeling, had this on the glacial draft, apparently colder than average, and it was delightfully clean and refreshing. pretty pour too, an inch of permanent and thick white head on top of radiant golden brassy brew, lovely clarity. some floral character to the hops as it warms, a touch metallic as many of them are here then too, but a fast finish nevertheless. decent body to it, more of a german malt thing too, less cheap tasting than its peers, and frankly a delicious little brew that i could have made an afternoon of. i like how it seemed common to serve small pours of this so that constant cold ones could be brought, makes awesome sense for outdoor daytime drinking. way way way better than its ratings here in my experience..."
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3,"Pours a clear golden color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has malts and floral hints
T-Taste follows the nose with malt and floral flavors
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent pils"
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,3.5,"On tap. White head with lace. Golden color. Clear.

Earthy and grassy hops. Bready and biscuit malts. Typical pils flavor. Dry and lightly bitter.

Light bodied. Easy drinking."
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.79,"This smells and tastes really like a typical Euro Lager - tastes like a damp washing cloth, tastes rotten but if you drink it quick enough, it tastes boozy. This latter is a good point for me. But still, for only 40 cents this beer is way better than most of the Euro Lager crap you get for twice or three times more in Hungary... so no complaints - but no praises either."
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.87,"Bought in Spain, from a litre bottle poured in a caña glass.
Bright crystalline pale gold color, bitter creamed corn aroma.
Starts with good head and carbonation, but they don't last very long, close to flat after the first half (and it's a small glass 20cl). light body.
Refreshing, watery, nothing special, very tasteless, somehow bitter, maybe herbal hops.
Although I am Spanish, I got to admit I am not prod of this beer.
Paired with a delicious jamón serranno, that would go really with with an IPA. Well, next time!"
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2.4,Can and on-tap: Poured a clear golden color ale with a nice white foamy head with OK retention and light lacing. Aroma of light adjunct notes with some residual sugar notes is OK. Taste is a mix of residual sugar notes with some adjunct and light cereal notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Another pale lager with too much residual sugar and limited flavours.
Worst,Cruzcampo Pilsener,2,"Light and refreshing. Almost like water. When it is really hot, this ice cold is not a bad option.

Difficult to rate, it definitely is not a complex, tasteful beer, however it's refreshingness is immense.

Actually you may as well just mix another beer with water, fuck this"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,3.57,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Would much prefer if the can was full blue or full silver, the gradient isn't doing it for me. That said, the circular seal is nice, and the emphasis on ""Golden"" draws in the eyes. The Minnesota shaped barcode is a neat touch too.

Smell - I can't quite describe the experience of this beer hitting my nose. The smell gets you from a good distance away, but it's the smell of nearly nothing. It's like a diamond plate floor covered in sticky beer residue. Very metallic and mildly sweet.

Taste - Thankfully, the taste is much more interesting than the smell. It's a comforting flavor too. Even though I've never had this beer before, it tastes like tailgating, like being in a trailer at the racetrack, like going to a concert at the county fair. This tastes like public gatherings. Or more realistically, it's a fine balance of malty and earthy. Not too sweet, not too bitter. An exemplary AAL.

Feel - This beer feels perfectly matched to its taste. Medium-thin body with just enough back-of-tongue sparkle to it.

Overall - I definitely prefer this to the light version, but the light version is probably objectively better for a full day of parking lot drinking. However, at home, I'm much more comfortable with the full weight. It's tasty, it's easy, it's relaxing, and I can confidently say that I like it."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,3.04,"I can't find this one around central WI, Golden Light is everywhere. I pick ups 12pk every time I visit family in MN. It is a nice change in my regular adjunct lager rotation. Nothing special, just a good beer."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,3.05,"Got to try this when working in Minnesota in 2002.Not a bad beer,and the locals consumed it like water.Seems AB would sell this outside the Midwest,as not available in the Southwest.Overall,fairly decent offering"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,5,I believe this is the smoothest tasting brew so far out of all Michelob products. It leaves no bitter after taste. Very smooth body and flavor. Good job!
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,4.15,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed several cans of Michelob Golden Draft at a recent trivia night fundraiser for my kid's school. It was much better than the other beers offered, including PBR and Budweiser. I just wish I could find it in stores as all I can seem to find is Golden Light."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,3.81,"By some insane Indiana state law, it was (is?) illegal to buy alcohol except in bars and restaurants on Sunday. I remember that this one came out the first Sunday that I was in grad school at Purdue. Since I couldn't take a six-pack back to the dorm with me, I sat in the local bar, not too far off campus, drank a few pitchers of this, then went to the free showing of ""Alladin"" on campus, taking many pee breaks. Oh, those youthful magic moments."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,2.92,"On tap

A - clear straw in color. thin white head that dissipates very quickly. moderate carbonation. 3.25/5

S - grassy hops. light cereal and bready malt. very subdued. 2.5/5

T - grassy hops. mor hop flavor than anything. some light cereal malt. 3/5

M - ultra light. carbonation tickle. 3.25/5

O - good flavor, simple and straightforward. very easy drinking beer, especially on a hot St. Louis afternoon prior to game time. 3/5"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,2.75,"Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has slight malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a slight nalt flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A decent beer"
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,3,"There is nothing grossly offensive about this beer there just is not much there - not much aroma, not much hop, pours brilliantly clear, balanced and crisp, thin body, fizzy."
Worst,Michelob Golden Draft,4,"Not as bad as other people claim.

Taste: Grainy with a mild hop finish

Smell: Summer-like smell

Feel: Watery, but not too watery.

Look: Typical straw colored pale lager."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.22,"Melbourne Bitter is often seen as Victoria Bitters younger cousin, well, at least outside of Victoria that is. In recent years in seems to have been more prominent outside of Victoria, but holds a lesser reputation to the more well known VB. Something that is more widely regarding in regional Victoria, than Melbourne, but holds up as another standard Australian macro lager.

Look: Standard Australian lager. Dark golden lager hue. Clear, filtered. Thin soapy white head that disappears quicker than the sun in Melbourne. Think tiny bubbles floating to the top. Poured out of a 750ml longneck, looks almost flat.

Smell: Honestly not a lot going on. Very faint adjunct grain smell, hint of citrus hop, obviously Pride of Ringwood. There is a metallic ring I'm picking up. Honestly not a lot going on.

Taste: It's mild, and only slightly offensive. Very thin, carbonated. Classic bitter pride of Ringwood hop presence, but metallic flavour holds strong. Decent malt presence gives it a rounded sweetness. Slight graininess but honestly not a great deal going on. Dry-ish finish.

Feel: Thin, heavily carbonated. On a hot summers day, can see the refreshment value in this but not much else.

Overall: It's another mass produced Aussie macro lager. I've had in on tap in Victoria, and I honestly remember it drinking a whole lot better on tap than out of the bottle I'm reviewing it on. VB is probably marginally better than it, but to me it's not completely horrid. It's not great, and I'd probably prefer a European Supermarket beer over it, but it's nothing great. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it unless it's on special, or I'm in Victoria and there's nothing better on tap."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.31,"Pours out clear golden with high fluffy head. Musty cardboard aroma, tastes like white school paste. At least a hint of bitterness at the finish, but a tough drink to get down."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,3.03,I find this beer to be very sessionable it's a lager that's good to smash down at a bbq on a hot day.i get a earthy bitter taste and finishes very crisp.
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,1.23,"Too bad I can't give negative points. This is by far the worst thing I ever tasted in life... I had to vomit just by tasting it. I could not believe myself so got a bottle the next day, same reaction..."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,5,"This is a drink for men. The sort of men that discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn. A strong, earthly bitter taste from the pride of Ringwood hops gives the taste buds, or caliculus gustatererius if you will, a flavor sensation usually reserved for kings among men or gods. The little red delights are commonplace in the fridges and eskys of all the great beer drinkers in this big, brown, wide, wonderful land of ours and will forever be so."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,4.46,"This was a delicious beer.
I would definitely have another, and I will.
In fact I already did. Lots.
Pours really well into beer bong.
Minimal froth, crisp taste.
Can crushed easily upon finishing.
Attractive logo.
Best enjoyed with your m8s.
Great accompaniment to the footy/cricket.
Discount on slabs at liquorland Frankston - $37.50 for 24 cans."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.33,"Poured at a good temperature with a mammoth, thick, foamy, frothy, billowy, off-white head (suspect foaming agents) and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow. Aroma reminds me of a common lager with a bit o hop. Flavor’s like nose, bitter, sweet, and tang are actually fairly balanced, adjuncts are present, as are off flavs, body/carbonation are soft. Finish is like flavor. I just want to get it over."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2,"A: Pours a dark yellow color with a small head that fades to no real lacing.

S: Aromais musty. Blend of yeast and hops with a bit of sweetness in the background. Has that old stale beer smell.

T: Taste is not much better, sort of funky with yeast and malt sweetness. Coarse bitterness and a sticky finish.

F: Light body, has a lot of rough edges and high carbonation.

O: Not a decent drinker, but then you can't expect too much from a poor step sister of Victoria Bitter."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,5,"Picked up one of these bad boys at my local. Was shocked at how cheap this devil is!
Cracked it on the tram home, delicious. Smashable. Aromatic hops come oozing out of this fine beer. very sessionable, recommend it to anyone! Also says melbourne on the front.

10 out of 10."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,1.21,"Uncaps with a weedy little sizzle, and pours surprisingly flat and lifeless for an Aussie macro lager—a dull golden colour, with a wispy film of white on the top and very little visible carbonation. Body is quite fine, and what carbonation is there actually looks quite dense.

Nose is what you expect from the genre, with perhaps a little more tilt towards the American macro style, with a strong aroma of cereal adjuncts coming through. Still some metallic twinges to it, and a hint of that muddy, gritty yeast character characteristic of these beers.

Taste is repugnant. Along with the classic CUB yeast dirge, there's a lilting organic character like worm-eaten unripened tomatoes, still containing the pesticides whose job it was to keep the worms off in the first place. Rank and fetid and lingering, leaving a really unsavoury taste in the mouth. Finish is dry and weak, except for that lingering malignancy.

Horrid beer. In some ways, even though it's not as bad all over as some other beers I have, this is worse, because the appearance and the smell don't warn you about how terrible is the thing you're about to put in your mouth.

Well, let this review be your warning instead. Stay away."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,1.97,"Single bottle picked up at a Canberra grocery store.

Poured into a small tumbler. My first clue that I had erred in my purchasing decision was the colour and appearance of this brew, which is all macro lager. Pale golden, loads of visible carbonation, thin soapy head. Doesn't look great. Even though it looks like a lager should, when a beer decidees to call itself a 'Bitter' I can't help but be disappointed when it looks like a lager. Then again, another Carlton product - Victoria Bitter - does the exact same thing. Should have guessed...

Nose is almost non-existent - pale malts, a bit of lemon, chemical. Smells like Bud.

My first sip from the bottle reminded me of those first sips of beer from my dad's nearly empty bottles when I was a kid. Not a good sign. The taste of the poured out stuff was not much better, just a macro lager with a foul, chemical character. Hard to finish. Thin-bodied, harsh carbonation. Yellow fizzy water.

Never again, nor anything else from Carlton and United. Avoid!"
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.04,"Pale gold pour with a small head that fades rapidly.
Dirty aroma of stale beer, grainy malt and cardboard, that's all.
Cooked corn and cardboard make up the entirety of the flavours.
Pretty high carbonation.
Utter rubbish. Does anyone drink this any more?"
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.45,"Pours a yellowish brown, light bubblies, not much odor.

Flavor is fairly underwhelming but not terrible. Very malty, with some fruitiness coming through. Not particularly bitter, despite the moniker.

Easy enough to drink, but not the most drinkable beer, but better than VB."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.29,"Do not judge a book by its cover could not be more apt then when applied to this beer. It looks great. A good finger of head, nice retention and good lacing. Unfortunately that is where the positive elements sort of stop.
The aroma is of grains - Weet bix. The taste is metallic and husky. Some bitterness. A low carbonation.
The beer actually gets more drinkable as it goes on. Perhaps the taste buds deaden? This is not undrinkable, and I have been known to have more than one at the footy but only because there are no other options."
Worst,Melbourne Bitter,2.03,"Appearance - 3.0
Poured a finger and a half of foamy white head that reduced to a thin, patchy layer over a clear yellow body that has a tinge of brown.

Smell - 2.5
Grain, metal and a little vaguely fruity hop and yeast character.

Taste - 1.5
Very similar to VB, although a little more pleasant (or less nasty) to my taste. Similar stale, grain, husk and metal flavour as VB, with more hops and yeast, providing a beer that is stronger flavoured, more bitter, and still a pretty generic macro lager.

Mouthfeel - 2.5
Low to moderate level of carbonation, somewhat astringent.

Drinkability - 2.0
Strong flavour means it is less drinkable than most macro lagers.

OVERALL - 2.15
I think this is quite similar to Toohey's New - it dares to have more flavour than your regular macro lager, yet still tastes pretty bad. Not quite awful, but for from being a good beer. Another one to drink cold, it just gets worse with warming."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,4.11,"Well... This is a unique one. It's apparently beer that is flavored with lime. I don't really get the taste of beer coming through.

This is like Corona that comes with lime already in it, except it's an interpretation by Labatt. It has a nice scent to it.

The lime flavoring tastes a bit artificial but I'm guessing they just put the type of lime juice you'd find at the store that comes in the green plastic lime bottle intinto it.

Not the best but not the worst. If you like Corona with lime, you might like this."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,2.89,"Pours very pale yellow with a 2 inch white head. Moderate lacing.

Strong aroma of lime, smells sweet.

Taste is lime, not much else.

Light bodied, thin and watery. Very little carbonation. Dry, slightly bitter finish.

Not bad for a light beer albeit, not as good as Labatt Light grapefruit."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.77,"(24 oz can, B058... purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, pale yellow-gold liquid; tons of white foam on pour, tight, cottony pad... head fizzles out rather quick; not really any lace, the lil boogs slip away

S: good bit of lime aroma dominating its scent, almost smells real; really smells more like Sprite with a lil (corn-fed) beer mixed in... smells alright for what it smells like, a shandy

T: not gonna lie, a relatively delightful flavor at first: lime-infused, lightly-doughy malt base; clean and dry on the outflow, though the finish has the faintest color to it like a mix between a lime sweet-tart candy / lime air freshener... humming aftertaste of lime and cereal, like Trix; dry, doughy

F: very soft suds, pillowy texture and flow, disappearing finish... maybe a delicate touch of residual lime syrup slickness? who knows?... light and easy-drinking, even when drinking at cellar temp

O: tried it just to try it once... it wasn't too too dissimilar to a Mexican beer with actual limes shoved in the bottle (minus real citrus acidity); kind of surprising and thankful it didn't taste more glaringly artificial... maybe this is what light beers need - flavor infusion - so what... (1423)"
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.65,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 6/22/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a small fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that linger. Light spotty lacing on the, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no yeasty notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice fruited light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not too watery for the ABV. Great balance between vibrant limes and pils malt/grains; with solid earthy hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example. Would be great for summer."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,5,Not bad. Didn’t find the lime flavor overpowering. Tasted more at the end of each sip than at the beginning. Refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Very watery mouthfeel so it goes right down. Might have it again sometime. Update : I did have it again.Cheers.
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.98,"Well, it looks like even Canadian brewers are jumping on the fad that is light lagers with lime flavoring. I went into this review knowing full well that this wasn't going to be a high quality beer that I'd be reviewing, but a part of me wanted to know how it would stack up against Bud Light Lime and its ilk. Why? Who knows, but that's just the way my mind works.

Labatt Light Lime pours a yellow/gold color. A fizzy, sudsy head (less than a pinky's worth) forms and thins out in a little under 30 seconds. There was quite a collection of fizzy ""soda"" bubbles on the side of the glass. The aroma was of sweet citrus and lime, with some light grain and vegetable smell. As mentioned, the beer is indeed fizzy, and overall feels pretty thin on the palette. The light citric/lime flavor is the most dominant note here, but the beer is still pretty watery even with that lime presence. There are some grain and vegetable flavors detectable behind the lime, but that's about it. The aftertaste is clean and almost non existant except for some non-descript dryness, and there is no alcoholic warmth at all in this beer.

Indeed, not a high quality beer at all. It is easy to drink, but I would say this is more lime than beer. Save for a summer day thirst quencher when you need something to whet your whistle and nothing more."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,1.26,"This is up there with the absolute worst beers I've ever had.

It pours like you'd expect, clear and gold, with a quickly dissipating head.

This smells so unbelievably artificial, like syrupy and saccharine lime, with corn syrup and skunk.

This honestly tastes terrible. It's revolting, with an overly artificial and unpleasant lime flavor, just out whatever the base light lager tastes like. I get some sweet corn and syrupyness This isn't even all that crisp, which is what the style is supposed to be.

This is just sad. There's no reason at all to drink this."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.06,"Labatt Blue Light Lime brewed Labatt Brewing Company Ltd., with an ABV of 4.00% This brew pours out a nice golden, amber color with a smell white head. The head to this brew goes away fast. This brew has the look of most light lagers on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The smell of Labatt Blue Light Lime is sweet with lime grains and malts. Labatt Blue Light Lime smell puts you in the mind set of lemon lime soda. Now for the taste , it is Lime, with some beer taste. This brew has a nice smooth lime taste to it. Not much else to say. The mouthfeel of Labatt Blue Light Lime, is Light , Smooth, clean and refreshing. This is a nice smooth brew to drink on a hot day. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. Overall I'm giving Labatt Blue Light Lime a 3 out of 5. Labatt Brewing Company Ltd.,did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again when it get really hot."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,3.1,"Labatt Blue Light Lime | Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is non-existent, with minimal lacing,and a clear pale golden body.

I smell lemon-lime soda,basically. This is kind of expected per this style, as I review WITHIN THE STYLE.

Tastes like a less limey Bud Light with Lime. Not to say this is a bad thing per se if its in the high 80's with well over 50% humidity.

The mouthfeel here is light and crisp.

Overall, I'l give Labatt Blue Light Lime | Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. a 3 rating. Nothing great, but nothing awful for what it is."
Worst,Labatt Blue Light Lime,2.54,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of carbonation.
S: Light to moderate aromas of artificial lime are present in the nose. It poured with a thin collar of bubbles around the edge of the glass.
T: The taste follows the smell, having initial flavors of artificial lime but these quickly dissipated, leaving flavors of grainy malts.
M: It feels light-bodied and slightly watery on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer would have been more comparable to Bud Light Lime if the lime flavor didn't quickly disappear from the taste.

Serving type: bottle"
Worst,Skol Beer,4,"I am trying to get myself as close to a milestone before tomorrow evening as possible, so I am running through as much of the backlog to position myself to be able to meet it as possible. As such, The CANQuest (tm) is going to be hitting some oddballs.

From the CAN: ""European Brewing Tradition * Premium Quality Beer""; ""Imported""; ""'One of the Top 5 Selling Beers In the World' Source: CANadean"".

I kind of liked that this is a simple EPL. It gave me the ChANce to simply CANduct a quick & simple Crack! & Glug, resulting in the formation of just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with admirable retention in the face of tonight's heat & humidity. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, bringing The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus in from the living room, where they were watching tonight's PGH Pirates (Black & GOLD) game on teevee. Nose was malty sweet, but very clean & quite simply, a Lager. I prefer this style over AALs any day of the week at any time. Mouthfeel was medium, big for the style. The taste was quite malty & sweet, more bready than malty, but still a refreshing drink on a hot, humid Summer's night. I have baseball on the telly & this would be a welcome alternative to drinking an AAL at the ballpark. Finish was semi-sweet, just sweet enough for my taste. This was not a bad beer. YMMV."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.18,"Got this in Malaysia. 320ml can poured into a pint glass.

Metallic, sulfur, grain, DMS, grass.

T:
Metallic, sulfur, grain, DMS, grass, a bit yeasty sour, quite insipid.

F+O:
Light body, moderate crisp and carbonation, not that smooth, semi-dry finish. Better no repeat."
Worst,Skol Beer,1.69,"320ml can from 7-Eleven in Malaysia (RM7.50):
Light and incredibly clear, golden straw coloured with a thin, half centimetre head that is bubbly but at least it manages to hold for a little while, barely budging at all over the first few minutes.

Sweet with a lot of corn and grain plus a little bit of alcohol and plenty of skunk coming through. There is a sort of metallic smell initially as well but the beer smells quite cheap on the nose.

Bland tasting at first with a sort of sweet, carbonated water taste and some mild bitterness and some skunky flavours as well. There is some faint grassy hops and a little corn with some cheap lager malts as well.

Grainy & light bodied with a skunky flavour throughout but nothing overpowering at least. There is a clean but very bland mouthfeel and the finish has touches of bitterness and is dry too.

A very poor effort and if I'm honest it was pretty much what I had been expecting from this one. Not one I can recommend and I can't imagine the beer is any good no matter where it is brewed around the world."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.68,"Appearance: Yellow, lots of bubbles, rocky head.

Smell: Corny, mild seltzer.

Taste: Grain, corn, mild sweetness. A hint of bitterness.

Drinkabilty: Easily drinkable, hot weather beer.

Another cheapo beer from the 7-11 in Hong Kong. I thought this could be bad since it was the cheapest in the fridge, but it's not bad. Seemingly every beer is corny and sweet here in China."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.48,"Got this single 330mL bottle at Manchester Wine and Liquors, Manchester CT, for $1.33. Date stampled on the label is 06.10.2006, so this could be quite old (preparing for skunk). Served cold in a chilled pint glass.

Clear deep yellow brew generates a half inch of bubbly foam that settles quickly to just a spotty layer. Mild aroma of clean semi-sweet pale malt and a tiny bit of soft lemon hop. Taste follows from the smell with a little fruity aspect to the sweetness. It's an awkward level of taste, too little to make it worthwhile and just barely enough to keep it from being completely flat. Feel is thin with a soft fizzy carbonation, watery."
Worst,Skol Beer,3.25,"SKOL lager beer is a yellow color with a one finger white head that dissipates into a collar.

The aroma is that sweet grain lager smell, no sign of the dreaded skunk anywhere.

The taste follows the aroma with the grainy sweet, but in addition, it has a light lime citrus presence.

The mouth feel is light bodied and minimal carbonation.

Drinkability, like most acceptable tasting lagers, is very good.

Absolutely nothing wrong with this lager, except that it's a lager and not a big hop or malt bomb."
Worst,Skol Beer,3.25,"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smells mostly of malts, some hops. Taste is crisp, a bit of hops, not overly flavorful. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall not a bad brew, but nothing great."
Worst,Skol Beer,1.75,"Clear pissy looking yellow with a puny white head that shrinks to a skim almost immediately after pouring into the glass. The nose is sweet barley and grass with a pronounced mineraly quality. This beer is just not very good. Light cooked corn with a healthy dose of brown paper bag. Watery is the best description I can give the mouthfeel on this one. Don't bother with Skol, it stinks."
Worst,Skol Beer,3,"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half-inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. It smells like sweet malt and grain. No hops that I can notice. The taste is the same as the aroma, but it has a slight bittersweet finish. With that being said, there aren't any offensive aromas or tastes at all. Mouthfeel/body is light and thin, but not bad. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink. For the style, it's pretty much an average all-around beer. It's not bad, but not exactly good either. I've certainly had worse."
Worst,Skol Beer,3.56,"A - Crystal clear pale yellow with a fizzy 1/2 inch head that fizzles down to nothing within a few seconds. Very little soapy flimsy lace sticks to the glass. Looks like any old American macro pisswasser.

S - Happily, this has a more interesting nose than the appearance would suggest. It's definitely basic, but it's firmly within the parameters of the style, and I would most likely peg it as such in a blind sniff test. Mild caramel sweet notes, with gentle floral hops and a adjunct-y notes that gives the style away.

T - Not too bad! Sweet caramel and vanilla, with mildly floral hops that add just enough bitterness to even out the sweetness. This isn't complex in any way, but it sure is tasty!

M - Light bodied, but far from watery. This is highly carbonated, refreshing, and thirst quenching. The finish is neutral with lingering notes of vanilla bean.

D - This is a damn fine ""sweltering heat"" thirst quencher that beats all of the Mexi-lagers at their own game. Come to think of it, Turkey is warm and lined with sandy resort beaches just like Mexico. Is Turkey the Caribbean of Europe? If so, this is the perfect brew for a long lazy day at a Turkish beach!"
Worst,Skol Beer,2.37,"There was a 6 pack of this on clearance for $2.99 so I figured I'd give it a whirl.

I see why it was on clearance.. a very bland, macro tasting beer. No head, no lacing, and pours a light golden color. Some bubbles are seen making their way to the top but not much. Taste is of European hops (slightly) and corn and/or rice flavors. Has a weird aftertaste and it's almost tough to swallow. Looks like the 5 other beers will stink around in the fridge for any of my friends who want a beer."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.41,"Pours a clear golden yellow with a foamy white head. Some head retention and slight lacing. Moderately carbonated.

Grainy smell with a slight hop accent. Sweeter malt characteristics.

Not much flavor. Very slight hop flavor at the end. Watery.

Feels highly carbonated in the mouth. Goes down easily.

Could easily consume several, but nothing remarkable.

Also looked at the date on the bottle - 09.02.2007 - Imagine that's February of 2007."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.72,"My label matches this one, but I couldn't find ""Turkey"" or ""Brasil"" anywhere on the package. This is a weird brand, it seems to be made and marketed around the world. A friend from Brasil shared this with me, said this was the most popular beer there...

Pour is a pale gold, dull foam with a fizzyness. Head is gone in less than a minute. Smell is papery and malty, maybe vegetable too.

Taste is bland, a little bit of sweet malt is there. It has such a watery feel, and an aftertaste that seems to hang in the back of the throat. I finished the bottle as a courtesy to my friend, but wouldn't seek this out on my own."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.25,"A - Poured out a highly carboanted, clear, yellow color with a very foamy, two-finger, white head. No lace.

S - It smelled of tons of corn and some grains. Also, a little yeast aroma.

T - It was slightly bittersweet and tasted of corn.

M - It was a little thin and very light bodied.

D - There is nothing particularly disagreeable about this beer, but there is nothing especailly good about it."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.18,"Medium golden with a thin patch of off-white foam, no real lacing discernible. Corn malt but little else is on the nose. I can't say that I'm surprised, honestly. Mild and sweet grassy malt carries the taste which, like the texture, is rather thin. Not offensive, just not impressive. At least it's smooth and OK cold. But this is like to many macros--thin, sweet corn malt, little else. Why bother.

Subpar, and one to avoid."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.78,"A clear hay yellow wih small and very sluggish bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The aroma is oflight pils and pale malts melding into a grassy adjunct with just a touch of tin. The taste is a light dry malt with some metallic notes ligering here and there. A little hard going down on some swallows, but still refreshes a little."
Worst,Skol Beer,1.53,"pours a pale golden color with hardly any foam, and what little there is, it disappears quickly. smell is not good, it smells kinda malty but thats it. taste is watery mess of wierd flavors. its a boring, tasteless beer overall. not recommended at all."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.5,"this beer is very odd. most reviews have described it as having a grassy or corny taste. i felt like the few bottles i had tasted like raisins or prunes, or maybe even currant. i was told by the provider that this was a turkish beer which was the second most popular beer in brasil. i cant believe this is a popular beer, but it sure is formidable at any rate. the kid who provided me a afew also said they were going for 9.99 for a case, 20.00 + change for 2 cases, thats right. so i gues what im saying is for economy (poor college kids) this is an acceptable choice, but man, caveat emptor."
Worst,Skol Beer,2.18,"Received in a beer gift pack with a bunch of other good quality micros.

Appearance: pours a clear pale yellow color with a one finger bright white head. The head falls apart quickly. No lacing develops.

Smell: barely any aroma here, as only a bit of grassiness comes through.

Taste: very light malt base, grass, corn, and an overcooked vegetable flavor. Bitterness is non-existant.

Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. Clean aftertaste. Light in body.

Drinkability: not a good beer at all, and the beer was not old or bad. I could not finish the glass. I would avoid this."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.16,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance - The beer pours a clear straw color with a small head of white foam. The head fades fast, leaving a tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell - The aroma is strongest of a caramel smell mixed with a touch of bread and hay. There is a tiny bit of grain and bay on there as well.
Taste - The taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste with a little bit of bread and cracker. Toward the end of the taste, some light herb and hay come to the tongue.
Mouthfeel - The body of the brew is light with a carbonation level that is average. For the style the feel is good and makes for an easy drinker.
Overall - Nothing great, but it is an easy drinking beach beer."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.63,"I would like to point out that it is against site policy to call out other raters in a negative fashion. By the same token, I would like to give my eternal thanks to my local, in-person trader, @tone77 for his massive recent drop-off that included this beer! I was astounded by how much beer he brought for me & shamed by the fact that mine was merely a paltry offering. 8=( I must atone to @tone77 !

From the Bottle (his drop-off, his call): ""Presidente Light Pilsener Style Beer"".

As I was prising the cap off of the Bottle for an eventual Pop!, I noticed a number of carbonation bubbles beginning to appear. Good! I like a well-carbonated beer. My follow-up slow, gentle C-Line pour still resulted in the formation of two-plus fingers of foamy. soapy, rocky, bone-white head with very good retention. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, just deep enough to entice The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas to drop in for a taste. Nose had a pronounced cereal-like graininess, but not much in the way of either hops or unwanted adjuncts. Hmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, on the big side for a Lager. The taste was sweet, mildly of perhaps (?) corn, but the fact that it was nearly unidentifiable was a bonus. It was a little too sweet & malty for my taste, but certainly well within specs for this style. I was rather impressed that it came across so well, coming from a green glass (!) bottle. Finish was semi-sweet, bordering on semi-dry. Again. more sweet than I would have liked, but not bad overall. As far as a steady diet of it might be concerned, I could see tiring of it fairly quickly. YMMV."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.39,"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of light grains. Taste is malts, grains, highly refreshing. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall I found it to be more flavorful and enjoyable than many in this style."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.69,"I was at an all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic. The only beer they had was El Presidente and El Presidente Light. And because it was all-inclusive, there was no charge for the beers. And the beers were everywhere. Every room had a mini-fridge stocked with sodas, water and El Presidente. There was a bar everywhere. Every pool had a bar. There were three bars on the beach. Every restaurant had a bar. The main building had three different bars. When we checked it there was a bar right there at the check in, and at every bar the only beer they had was El Presidente and El Presidente Light.

And I was loving it. One day I had ten beers before lunch. I was drinking so much beer that I decided to switch to El Presidente Light because it has a lower alcohol rate and it was easier on the G.I. system. This will always be among my favs."
Worst,Presidente Light,3,"From a green bottle it pours a clear light yellow color. Smell and taste had notes of floral lemon grass with corn,rice and malts. Mouth feel crisp but watered down,ice cold on the beach this one is ok."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.52,"Would like to point out Act25, twage04, StonedTrippin and a few others rated this on how it should be rated: it's a Caribbean light lager made in the Dominican Republic, so how does it hold up against other Caribbean light lagers? Like Red Stripe Light, Carib Light, Star Lite, etc.

Hey, not bad. It *does* have to be served ice-cold. Carbonation is impressive (and my $2.99 6-pack was flecked with dust and OOD)!

Presidente Light 12oz bottle, poured into new glass, had a neutral nose, light lace, fluffy on the tongue, an erstwhile but fleeting impression of melon and lemon, and a barely sweet-dank finish (as compared to the barely bitter-apple-pepper finish of a continental lager Light, like Heineken Light). When viewed appropriately versus other Caribbean Lights, it is more than passable (would probably pair well with anything from jerk chicken to ceviche), and represents a top value point if cruising or bar-hopping."
Worst,Presidente Light,3.14,"Presidente
A 3.25 as expected with more lace shards.
S 3 as expected. Watery
T 3.25 better than expected. Lemony. Cleansing scrubbing. No corn starchiness.
F. 3.25 clean good finish dry. Tingly.
O best of carribean

S- The aroma is pretty light and faint with some grainy malt along with a touch of hay and a hint of hops.

T- The taste is very light bodied with some pale malts and a clean finish.

M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a high amount of carbonation.

D- Overall, Presidente Light is a decent light beer but nothing I have any interest in purchasing again."
Worst,Presidente Light,2.45,Had on tap at a resort in the Dominican Republic. A light yellow with slightly higher than average carbonation. Malt and hop flavor or aroma is far harder to detect than in normal Presidente. Tastes more like the normal garden variety light macro adjunct lager. I had once and made sure to get normal Presidente from thereafter.
Worst,Old Monk 10000,3.03,"Sampling a cold 650 ml bottle of this beer poured into a chalice, because why not?
Consuming as part of the online malt liquor tasting.
The beer pours a bright rich clear golden color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 1 cm. This foam fades to a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass. Several lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface.
The aroma is fairly mild on this one with a little bit of grain and some general sweetness, with a bit of apple cider note and some corn husk. But very faint all around, may open up as it warms?
First sip reveals a light to medium body with fine and spacious carbonation. Texture is a little thin yet slick and does leave a slight coating feel on my lips.
Flavor is briefly grainy malt and then apple juice, apple cider and refined sugar. The finish is a little bit of white wine or green grape and tarter cider note. no hops no booze. Very easy to drink minus the sweetness and proximal to apple cider character. Finish is lingering now with that white wine note.
Glad to have tried it for the tasting, almost definitely wouldnt buy it again.
I dont hate this beer, but its pretty sweet so know that if you buy one!"
Worst,Old Monk 10000,3.45,"Straw yellow appearance with a thin white head. Smell is of grain malt, and a little of a dry apple cider character. Taste is lacking any real character, slightly sour but not in a good way. Though for a malt liquor, it's drinkable. The finish isn't terrible."
Worst,Old Monk 10000,3.7,"Old Monk 10000 has a fairly thick, bright white head, and a bubbly, hazy, straw-gold appearance, with minimal lacing. The aroma is of fermented, bready cereal grains. The flavor is of a slight, white wine or green apple note, with very faint hop character. Old Monk 10000 has a high-medium body and a semi-dry finish.

RJT"
Worst,Old Monk 10000,2.76,"L: Clear honey hue with a finger of stark white foam. Average retention but no lace.

S: Between a lager’s straw aroma and an off-dry saison. Strong apple blossoms.

T: Certainly an abbey ale. Full cracker and bready malts. Starts easy to drink, but gets a bit forward, sweet, and medicinal: an over the top middle taste that is hard to swallow.

F: Medium body and a bit heavy handed. The carbonation is serious but welcome and while the finish is drier, mid-palate is nearly cloying like a poor cider.

O: Funny looking through the prior review before coming up with my overall thoughts: phenolic, apples/cider, medicinal. Seems these are common sentiments. While there are well executed elements to the beer, it is not repeatable for me."
Worst,Old Monk 10000,3.32,"(650 ml bottle; Batch no. & Mfg. date both blank; purchased cold single... split poured between a fat tulip and a teku)

L: crystal-clear, honey-orange-amber colored liquid, tiny bit of dusty sediment afloat; tight, white, bubbly foam, holding more steady in the teku... lovely spongy collar keeps, but little-to-no lace

S: classic cake donut (or sugar cookie) malt base, subtle leather and vague coriander phenol spice, similar to what I've smelled in some (strong) pale Baltic lagers, notably Carlsberg Special Brew; so mildly medicinal, but more so almost cider-like... light-moderate overall intensity

T: oh yeah, but then no... dry, vaguely corn-meal cereal overtone, soft blast of ethanol through the middle, sort of stale, floury finish, lingering a sec before quietly degrading in the aftertaste... after a few moments, a vague (dry) apple pie flavor flickering... like a cider/champagne/malt liquor cocktail; flavors have a bit more pop/focus outta the teku

F: quiet heat lingering back and top of palate, rounded mellow bite... bottom of palate feels relatively dry and clean... marginally ragged around the edges, but doesn't have much viscosity or burn

O: reminds me of a lighter Axe Head - tastes a touch aged, but also doesn't taste carefully brewed and/or made to be sipped cellar temp from a glass... do keep the bottle wrapped in the paper bag, and this IS a race to the finish - on your marks! (1581)"
Worst,Old Monk 10000,2.8,"So it's pretty much a beefier malt liquor, I'm not a hater of malt liquor so I enjoyed it, and sitting at 8 percent you'll certainly feel it. Basically imagine malt liquor with more dust and piss and you've got it! For real though it wasn't half bad."
Worst,Old Monk 10000,3.41,"Ratings have some really wild variations on Old Monk 10000. There definitely is packaging incoherence (a Belgian Monk making strong blond lager -- and not an ale yeast -- exported only to the U.S. for those who seek an 8% alcohol kick for not much spent.) There probably also is a QC problem... since it is so seemingly incoherent, it may stay on the shelves and deteriorate. Whatever explains this huge variations in ratings, it is an interesting beer and not half-bad.... if you have it with Indian food ... as I did.

To Look at this beer is not enough to love it (actually the reverse is more true.) Smells are mostly malt and too little intrigue. Tastes are an interesting blend of sweet (malt and fruit/yeast) from beginning to end that is barely balanced by bitter hops. Alcohol is well concealed... I mean, really well concealed.

My only advice is: get lucky and find this before it deteriorates; drink it cold; and have it with Indian food. Lagers remain one of the better pairing with the Indian kitchen and Old Monk 10000 Pairs well with many of those spices."
Worst,Old Monk 10000,1.22,"600 ml bottle. Pours golden with fluffy, white head and soda like carbonation. Aroma is of some grassy hops and lemonade. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of chalk, mineral water, some chemical and robitusin. What a waste of money."
Worst,Old Monk 10000,2.34,"Poured into mug. The color is a golden straw with virtually no head or lacing. The smell is malty and sweet with a whiff of oak. The taste is quite sweet with a subtle fruitiness. It's very light in body and carbonation. Overall, I didn't expect much so I wasn't disappointed.

Worst,Bière Du Démon,1.48,"330ml bottle as a gift from France:
Shocking stuff & awful tasting throughout, the nose definitely wasn't as bad & came through very slightly better than expected but still wasn't exactly great but the taste was beyond bad. Coming through as a mix of strong alcohol grain & the odd pale malt, the beer was chemical-like in taste with an overpoweringly sickening taste & it meant it was one I struggled to drink even a fraction of before pouring it down the drain; only it's appearance (& to some extent, the nose) saved it from being one of the worst beers I've ever had."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,3.68,"Woooah there boy! This tipple is likely to 'tip'ple you over the edge!

Mega strength beer, and excessively so. I actually think it's not too bad, better than some Belgian tripels. A tall slim glass keeps the head, and served chilled takes a bit of the harshness away from it. It has a citrus aspect for me, and given the strength is remarkably smooth to drink. Don't be put off, definitely worth a purchase if available.
A couple of these and you'd be safe sleeping under a bush in the park on a cold night.....thus saving yourself a taxi fare to boot, which can be added to the coffers for sampling a few more brews. Every cloud and all that!

I came back to re-review this one after a second sampling, and down graded it a touch. It is still way way better than the reviews on here, and I think labelling it as a euro strong lager somehow assumes it will be naff right from the get go! But there is the anti-snob in me."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,2.15,"Pours a clear, maize color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong alcohol, slight dark citrus, and grain. Fits the style of an Euro Strong Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, slight dark citrus, and grain. Overall, weak appearance, alcohol completely dominates, poor body, aroma, and blend."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,2.68,"Colour: light gold, clear. White head, durability fatal, immediately disappears. Aroma little crisp, malty with a hint of honey and plenty of alcohol. Taste: no surprises, first alcohol, the second 12% alcohol, continue as in the aroma, alcohol plus gentle malt and honey. Gentian alcohol, low. High saturation."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,2.62,"I read a couple reviews here and the 'Bière du démon' is rated as poor. Maybe that's a tad harsh, just in my opinion. For a French strong lager and as far as I know there aren't many of those, it's slightly above average. Yes 12%ABV is a lot and especially for a lager. It's a beer I gave a try or two already, and won't buy the six-pack, assuming it's exist. A cheap buzz if you are around these parts. For the same brewery though, I suggest Goudale instead."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,3.28,"Aroma is very malty and hints at high ABV. Color is clear golden with thin but sticky head. Taste is sourish and , hints of honey and plenty of alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is right and despite alcohol burn, overall texture and palate is very smooth. But beware the high ABV, for a small bottle, this is potent stuff...."
Worst,Bière Du Démon,2.87,"Advertised as the strongest beer in the world, this might be the booziest euro strong lager but with 12% ABV it's far to be the strongest beer I ever consumed.
Very boozy nonetheless and cloying"

Worst,Bière Du Démon,1,"Une bière sans personnalité, dont l'unique intérêt serait le haut degré d'alcool. Mais l'argument ne convaincra que les alcooliques car pour le reste elle est totalement déséquilibrée. Trop de sucres residuels, un goût désagréable et un arrière-goût carrement infect. A éviter."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,2.39,"Pours copper amber clear with nice frothy foamy cap that quickly fades. Notes of metallic hops and pine. Sharp piney ipa with bitter hoppy after taste. Not for the non-ipa or craft snobs. An okay at best micro from Indian Wells with a 7.2% ABV punch (which is not written on the bottle). Not good, could not finish - first time I have EVER dumped most of my beer down the drain."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,2.35,"Comes in a mixture of yellow and orange with about a 2/3"" head. Aroma didn't drop hops, instead dropped an almost fusel amount of alcohol.

The taste had bitterness and an exceptional amount of alcohol sting, burn and bite. Its even acidic. Four different kinds of hops? They're lost in this alcohol bomb. The carbonation on these varies wildly, I've had them soft, I've had them soda like."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.87,"Appearance: Moderately hazy amber body, with a modest, fine-beaded white head, which soon collapses to a dusting of white foam. Modest agitation, say by gently tipping the glass, produces a surge of foam at the glass walls. The lacing is fine, and glass-coating.

Aroma: Dark bread notes and malt dominate the aroma, the hop presence is only slightly notable, and has an herbal quality. In all, the aroma seems quite understated for the style.

Taste: The taste begins with dark, bready malts, as the aroma would suggest. As the taste progresses, there is a moderate herbal hop presence, with a level of restraint that I would expect to find in a pale ale. Later in the taste, there are some citric hops. Finishes with a mild herbal bitterness.

Mouth feel: Soft, but a bit thin, with very mild carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: An lackluster example of the style.

Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.74,Just no. This did NOT taste like an ipa at all. Off aroma followed by an almost non existent hop profile. It basically tastes like a mediocre homebrew.
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.25,I actually stopped at this brewery on my way home from Mammoth. When you walk in you get more of a factory operation feeling than a beer loving microbrewery feeling. They seem to have more than half of their store dedicated to soda. They did have tastings and their flagship beer aged in oak barrels seemed like a waste of oak barrels. Getting to the beer...I'm not going to say it's the worst beer I've had but it's not far from it. I would not purchase this beer again unless it was around the price of Natty ice. It has a clean taste yet lacks the signature taste you get from certain IPA's. The carbonation is weird too...almost as if they gave it extra carbonation or something from their soda machines. For $7.99+ for a six pack your money will be better spend on something like Sierra Nevada.
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.94,"Creamy taste like no other IPA Ive tasted. Has no resemblance of an IPA in taste, feel and smell. Not much going on here and rather boring. I still cant believe its an IPA. Think i will skip trying this brew company for now but wish them the best of luck. :-)"
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.56,"Isn't an IPA supposed to have some bitter quality from the hops? What I tasted was more sour than anything (perhaps they should just call it a sour beer). Also, not sure why there were proteins floating around in the beer. Shouldn't a professional brewery know how to get that out of the beer? This is he second of four styles I bought from these guys today, and so far they both sucked."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.98,"I've been reading and consulting BA for a long time, but this is the beer that made me register. It's the worst craft beer I've ever had. In addition to the sub par taste and aroma, the carbonation on it was out of control. First I sipped from the bottle and the gases kind of exploded in my mouth! Then I decided to pour into a glass to let it mellow out for a while. Despite my slow and careful pour, the foam overflowed and I was left with a head that took up most of the glass. I put it in the fridge to try again later - took one more sip and poured the rest down the sink. I live in Singapore now where American craft beer is super expensive (about $7 USD for a 12oz bottle), so I'm glad this was a gift and not something I bought myself."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,1.88,"Mother of gawd, I didn't even look at the reviews before I reviewed this brew. But fack, this is just downright awful. this tastes like rotten fruit, and I even received a fresh bottle. This is just very bland, no citrus from ""6"" hops, just blah. I'm sorry, if you crafted this, I commend you, but please try this different. There's nothing from the hops other than bitter, the only thing noticeable is the bitter and the malt. The only good thing I can say from this is I'm feeling light headed. Can't believe I spent $7 on a bottle of this. Do yourself a favor if you're a beer nerd, you probably know the store owner, ask him for an exchange."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,3.2,"Poured straight from bottle to a chilled glass.

Appearance - To me it looks like your typical IPA, dark amber color with a touch of light brown. After pouring there wasn't much head, about a fingers worth. Quickly dissipates to a thin and hardly noticeable head. Noticeable lacing around the glass.

Smell - For some reason, I immediately thought of pizza dough when I took a sniff of this beer. Some caramel hints but not much hop presence that I can smell.

Taste - After reading some of the reviews on this one, I really didn't think this beer was going to taste good. I have to disagree here. The first thing I notice as I take a drink is the piney hop flavor that really presents itself without being too bitter. The hops tie in nicely to the malt and caramel flavors in this beer, but I will say that for an IPA it isn't as bitter as I would like. It does taste good, but it doesn't scream IPA.

Mouth - Feels light bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down decently smooth but the carbonation lightly tickles the back of the throat. It is a little watery.

Overall - It seems that this is either a love it or hate it beer. I have to say that it isn't amazing but it is quite drinkable. My main gripe with it is that it really doesn't seem like a true IPA. The hops just aren't there like they should be. The other flavors that come through kind of make up for this, though. If you're expecting a true, bitter IPA then you will be disappointed. I wouldn't pick up a six pack but I may be tempted to pick up a single bottle later on down the road."
Worst,Amnesia IPA,3.58,"Pours a clear amber color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are decent. Has a malty, piney aroma. Actually not bad. The taste is where it goes south. Malty taste, but the bitter hop is taste a little more like something went bad. Almost like wet leaves. Somewhat astringent aftertaste. There is some caramel at the end. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. I don't think the beer is as bad as some reviews have said. I had this beer a couple years ago and did give it a much lower rating, but I am presently surprised compared to the last time."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,3.12,"An enhanced brewing process breaks down more of the natural sugars to deliver a genuine Super Dry taste, with only a third of the carbs of standard full strength beer.This beer goes down quite easy."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.37,"This macrobrew is a light golden with minimal cotton-white head. The aroma spews overcooked cauliflower and other adjuncts. The flavor is much in the same ilk---adjunct sweetness along with starchy overtones. Void of bitterness. Super dry? I'm not sure, but definitely a macrobrew."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,1.95,"A - Golden yellow amber with a bubbly head and no lacing. Audibly effervescent.

S - Corn, grass, very light on aroma and typically macro.

T - A hint of granny smith apple perhaps, water, wet bread, not too sweet.

M - Moderate to high carbonation and thin body. Dryish finish.

O - Slightly less terrible than the biggest players in the Aussie macro game."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.59,"On tap while watching hockey. From notes.

A - Poured golden and bright. One finger of fluffy white head. Good carbonation, film of retention and good rings of lace.

S - Sweet grain, grassy hop note. Really mild.

T - Sweet grain, bread, an odd fruit-maybe peach or apple?

M - Good carbonation, light body, dry finish.

O/D - Nothing good to speak of. A pretty plain lager. Avoids corny sweetness of others but otherwise worth avoiding."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.43,"OK - this is a worry.

I am now reviewing my Most Currently Drunk beer. Why? Because they took Coopers Pale off at my local RSL, and this quite frankly is the best bet on tap. So thats 2 or 3 schooners on a Friday night. My Most Currenty drunk beer.

You know the score.

Looks like an Aussie, smells like nix cos it's too cold, tastes like an Aussie, only thing it does feel good in mouth. Good in summer, and not the worst macro by far.

All in all tho - I give up - maybe time to stay in?"
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.25,"Standard pale, fizzy soft drink appearance.

quite sweet on the nose, little to no hop aroma, little bit of phenol, wet dough, banana tones.

What do you expect, bland, nothing much to speak of from the taste compartment. Simple grain bill simple hops. Very soft drink like.

Seems like the brewers these days are just making the same old trash in different bottles with new labels and fancy names. Its not super dry at all so I have no idea what that indicates. I didn't have high expectations and rightly so.

Another bland and uninspiring offering from Australia's ""big boys"" brewers.

Better than some other main stream beers... just."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.12,"Pours a deep yellow colour, with just a filmy head of coarse bubbles. No lacing, and extremely filmy. It's a very, very uninspiring looking beer. I'm not enjoying the prospect of taking a sip.

Bit of banana phenols on the nose, but mostly bland. Indeed, it has quite a sweetness on the nose - I was expecting something crisp and dry -- perhaps there's a bit of grass or spice, but it mixes up with the sweetness into something terrible.

Bland, bland, bland on the palate. Clear again, but once again with that sweetness. Overall, it's hard to say anything more than watery, however. Carbonation is a bit too fizzy, leaving it bloating. It's really nothing, but it's not even dry, for a beer which claims as much.

Really quite terrible. It's so bland, but whatever characters it has are pretty awful. It doesn't even deliver what it promises. And I wasn't overly enamoured of that prospect anyway."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,2.9,"I'm going to be frank. I went into this thinking that I would hate it but found it to actually be a palatable drink. Nonetheless, as an essentially flavourless beer it won't be getting high marks.

It pours a light golden colour with a tiny head. Poor head retention.

The aroma isn't bad for the style with a faint malty note and a light spicy hop aroma.

The flavour is fairly empty, as one would expect from the style but I actually pick up a touch of malt and don't find it too bad. If this was the BJCP this beer would be doing okay.

The mouthfeel is very light (in fact the FG is 0.999) with high carbonation. I don't particularly like it but it is suitable for style.

As a lawnmover beer this is very good and I could drink this. Nonetheless, I wouldn't pay for one."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,1.58,"Pours pale gold with a large head that quickly fades into a scum-like layer.
Nose shows loads of sweet vegetal and rice notes, with some faint spicy hops in the background, followed later by some clean malt.
Very little in the way of flavours, there's some cardboardy cereal malt before a short-lived bitterness kicks in.
Carbonation is too high."
Worst,Hahn Super Dry,1.95,"Appearance - Usual Oz macro colour with excessive carbonation. 1 finger of very bubbly head which reduced.

Smell - Surprisingly, some of the malty odours I expect in a lager are present, but they are so mild this only deserves a 2 in this category.

Taste - What taste? Like most low carb beers, even most of the pleasant grainy lager flavours have been stripped away in this, leaving only a dry metallic flavour.

Mouthfeel - Like mineral water, but also cloying.

Drinkability - Despite all it's faults, I tend to choose this over Australian brewed Heineken and other similar lagers as a session drink. Not sure why, though.

Overall - Even worse than Pure Blonde. Bleurgh."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,2.88,"SanMiguel Especial, which come in a standard 330ml bottle with a medium ABV of 5,4%. Not to be mistaken with another beer named like that from the Philippines.

Poured into the Guinness it left a two inches white head quickly vanishing as I write this. Clear and golden yellow brew.

On the nose, it’s pretty dull some hints of floral notes and that’s about it.

On the palate, it’s again not opening a Pandora’s box of aromas of flavors, but that was expected for something I was fearing would be another mediocre industrial Euro Lager. It’s a bit richer than that. I like the dry finish and drinkability but I wasn’t looking for more from this one.

It’s a medium bodied beer with high carbonation. Dry finish and drinks well

Overall it’s not as awful as reviewed here or elsewhere. Best drink fresh and cold, would probably pair really well with España food but in lack of a Chorizo or Paella right now, not to mention being quite far from the Puerta del Sol, this will be a one and done. Ticked, reviewed. Not a huge aficionado but there are far worse European lager around here."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,2.54,"440ml can. 5.0% version, brewed in the UK by Carlsberg.

Drank from the can and a glass, tastes like copper nails, tastes far worse as it warms up, very metallic tasting.

Drank from a bottle previous times and really enjoyed it."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,2.94,"This one (5,4% ABV) is far better than their 4,5% version lager, which most people have rated under the Philippines branch brewery, even though many of us obviously have had it in Spain. Anyway, the 5,4% version is quite malty, with a barely sufficient hoppiness. An acceptable premium lager, not great but well worth having with (or without) a meal in Spain. This rating is based on a bottle bought in Norway, had travelled well."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,2.5,"440ml can. 5.0% version, brewed in the UK by Carlsberg.
L: Clear, golden colour with many streams of bubbles. Excellent head is big, white, soapy & long-lasting. Served in a cold glass with beads of condensation, this is exactly how you want a lager to look.
S: Absolutely nothing.
T: Sweet & grainy. Negligible hop flavour.
F: Thin mouthfeel almost saved by moderate carbonation.
O: Incredibly bland. Designed to be drunk ice cold. Looks great and is well sessionable, otherwise poor.

PS. DO drink ice cold. This beer becomes sickly sweet as it warms."

More malty than most ""Premium Lagers"".The malt base reminds me a lot of Staropramen, but with the typical low bitterniss of other ""Premium Lagers""
A drinkable,if unexciting Premium Lager with a heavier malt base than it's competitors."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,2,"Cerveza de color dorado, de baja carbonatación y cuerpo ligero. Aroma a malta. El sabor en boca tiene detalles de malta y lúpulo. Sencilla para tomar, con pocas pretensiones."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,3.01,"There seems to be general confusion between the two listings for this beer, and it seems because it is brewed in several locations, and the relevent one might not be indicated on the can/bottle. [I know the San Miguel available in SE-Asia generally is the one brewed in the Philippines].
I bought my 440ml cans in Waitrose London. They show the ABV% at 5.0%. BB: 26/5/19. 'Brewed and canned in the EU by Carlsberg UK Ltd, Northampton'. Does that mean it's not brewed in Spain, it's unclear to me.
L-Quite pale gold, High carbonation. Pours with 3-finger white head slowly reducing to lacing.
S- A little sour, and not much else to note.
T- Quite hoppy dry, into a richer finish than expected. After I noticed the ambiguous origin I feared this was another industrial euro-lager, but it has something more to it than just that.
M- I think it is well balanced between dryness and richness, and maintains refreshing carbonation on the tongue.
O- Nothing particularly disinctive, but nothing actively wrong either. This would be a decent session-beer to me."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,1.9,"It's kind of strange as when you drink the San Miguel in Mallorca, it's a pretty good beer, both as draft or in bottle. However when bought outside Spain, it seems to be different!

This apparently is brewed in Barcelona, and it actually called ""Tradicion"" as opposed to Especial. Not sure what the difference is, and couldn't tell from their website.

Spanish draft San Miguel I actually like and would give a good rating to. This however is very lifeless and not so great...

Anyway, aroma is very malty. Flavour is quite flat, but improves as it warms up slightly. Not much of an aftertaste and quite dry, very overtly pasteurized I would suggest.

Not a fan, it's a shame as the stuff in Spain is pretty good. Now sure about the Singapore version...

Interestingly on the bottle it does not seem to specify exactly where it is made, it's very possible this is a cheaper and totally different version of the Spanish one, from memory I have had a UK brewed one before that was not so great also..."
Worst,San Miguel Especial,1.44,"A fairly drinkable pale lower, very bright, slightly slightly slightly yellow body, no foam, vague tones of fine malt with a bitter edge; advice good cold for the best taste"
Worst,San Miguel Especial,3.02,"The time has come to re-evaluate the San Mig. After a few years things tend to taste better, but not sure if this one made any difference since then. Tasteless lager with dry bitterness remaining in the mouth... German lager-esque? But it's okay, especially with food, despite its wateriness. Otherwise you might not want to be drinking it too much on its own..."
Worst,Brahma Chopp,3.28,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Straw colored, thin white head, mild lacing, abundant carbonation. Aroma of musty grains. Mouthfeel is light, thin, and frothy. Flavor of grain husks, cracker, some grassy hops in the background. Overall: decent, but that's about it."
Worst,Brahma Chopp,1.77,This might be the best beer you can find in some parts of Amazonian Brazil. A bottle makes it special. Remind yourself that the beer is just to stay hydrated and wash down the world's best fish.
Worst,Brahma Chopp,3.06,"The first beer I had from Brazil and it was better than I expected! Of course it is ""just"" a lager but it has a surprisingly sweet fruitiness to it that's still enjoyable and not overly sweet. Some might not like this feature about it but for me, it is the very key to its uniqueness. Consumable, fruity, refreshing. All good!"
Worst,Brahma Chopp,1.66,"L: Very light gold beer, very low retention.
S: Grassy, sweet malt.
T: Sweet water, grass, clearly an immature beer.
F: Very watery, carbonation is on the low side.
O: There are better, wouldn't go for a second try in this one."
Worst,Brahma Chopp,2.97,"355 ml bottle, 4.80% ABV, exp. 12/2017. Ingredients: water, malt, adjunct, hops. Very clear and yellow liquid, with little foam. Sweetness, white bread and fresh grass on aroma, all very faint. The same with its flavor. Watery and smooth with a dry finish. A bit too much of carbonation. I haven't taken one of those for ages and now I guess it has improved or maybe got back to what it was, as no bad notes showed up for me in this bottle version."
Worst,Brahma Chopp,2.76,"Can. From Festival de las Naciones. In Teku glass. Playing The Silent Age. No foam at all. Peculiar taste, with plenty of white grapes and a champagnesque aroma and taste, specially at beginning. Then it waters down"
Worst,Brahma Chopp,1.87,"I tried this against Antarctica Original and thought this was less clean it has a slightly funky taste and aftertaste. Still very similar and a typical light bodied adjunct lager. Clear light yellow pour with very little head, taste has milled corn and fermented grains and adjuncts, slightly metallic aftertaste. Feel is extremely light and a little fizzy. I prefer the Antarctica Original in terms of Brazilian AALs."
Worst,Brahma Chopp,2.55,"Actually, not the most awful AAL I've ever had. Drank straight from a 355ml bottle.

Apparently, this is *THEE* beer in Brazil.

Smelled skunky at first, but it doesn't taste it at all -- decent. Has a mild corny flavor with a negligible amount of malt. Pretty freakin' bland. What I do like about this beer though is that it has a pretty decent mouthfeel: actually a little creamy. Easy drinking, but lacking flavor. As a whole, in a world full of AAL's, this one stands out a little bit. Not terrible."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.12,"(Review from 330ml can)
Light golden colour with little to no head. No distinguish smell with little floral after taste. Just another normal Asian lager in the market. On a positive note, it does go well with Vietnamese food which are mostly rich in flavour"
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,3.47,"can purchased from an import store in tokyo. poured into a ceramic mug.

immediately intrigued by the first sip: a bold, rice-y flavor. perhaps because it was my first ""rice"" beer, but it left a strong impression. very interesting and memorable."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,3.51,"A fresh, kind of crisp lager is what this is. Smells okay, no foul tones, on the contrary, it is welcoming enough to make you want to taste it - and when you do, you don’t regret it. It is very alright for an adjunct (?) lager! No bitterness or metallic aftertaste whatsoever, very drinkable, very refreshing with mild carbonation. The japanese should try to imitate American Adjuncts instead of making a riced up German lager... this is way better."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.82,"From a can in Vietnam. Pours a golden color with a half inch of white head. Sweet grass smell. Medium feel, a little more substantial than other Vietnamese beers. Malt forward taste, dry on finish. My experience seems better than others, I guess if you find this fresh and drink it as cold as possible it's not bad."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.53,"Drank from a can on An Bang beach outside of Hoi An Vietnam. Accompanied a meal of steamed clams ,fried fish and stir fried morning glory. Our go to spot hosted by the lovely Tuyet. Have enjoyed this many times."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.3,"330ml pull-tab can from a minimart in Hanoi. Cost was below $0.50 USD. 5.30% ABV. Brief impressions below:

Has an odd adjuncty sweetness to it, bending it towards syrupy. Definitely artificial in terms of flavour. Cheap malt syrup, metallic off-flavour, pils/pale malts. No noticeable hop character.

Overcarbonated. Smooth, wet, unrefreshing, medium-bodied (where it ought to be light-bodied).

Drinkable as a budget brew when it's cold. Most Vietnamese canned beers seem to blend together with few distinctive characteristics, but this is recognizably a notch below the norm.

High D+ (2.50) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
July 11th, 2016: 2nd can purchased in Hoi An. Sabeco owns Bia Saigon, apparently.

The abnormally slender hole left by the pull-tab once opened allows less beer through than most cans, which is something of a Godsend seeing how ghastly this is.

Sweet malt syrup, adjunct (corn, rice, who cares?), stale barley. Too sweet, too simple, and certainly shallow. There's no intricacy or depth of flavour here at all, and nothing really to come for save for the 5.30% ABV (which I'll grant is above average for regional lagers, and isn't badly disguised).

Not a beer I intend to revisit unless economy demands it, even at its reasonable-by-Western-standards price. Drinkable enough, to be fair. We've all had worse, but it's still pretty poor fare.

D / AVOID"
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.05,"Run of the mill American Adjunct Lager with nothing special to write about. It's pure refreshment. And at 4.6-4.9% ABV, you can drink enough on a hot Vietnam day until you get a headache. The aftertaste was sour and unfulfilling as are all beers of this style.

Interesting that the can says ""Best served between 10-15 C (50-59 F)...Are they kidding!? That would make yucky beer taste horrible. Serve as cold as you can, 35-40F. If about 50F, hold your nose."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,2.43,"Perfect for Vietnam. On a hot muggy day which is most days drink this ice cold and pound multiple cans or bottles. You'll want to stay cool and also try to forget how damn hot it is. It's a typical lager similar to Heineken, Tsingtao, TIger etc. Bonus: in some of the villages in Vietnam you can get this delivered by the case to your home. But seriously just don't let this get warm."

Two fingers of head churn and settle. Clear effervescent yellow. It smells like sweet adjuncts and a whiff of isoamyl acetate.
It tastes..not good. Weird and sweet and sticky-fresh cheap grain. More like Bud Light than most rice lagers. Even the aftertaste is sort of acrid and unpleasant. Not recommended."
Worst,333 Premium Export Beer,3.62,"Poured from the 330mL can into a standard pint glass at a Vietnamese restaurant in Shanghai China.

A: The beer is a pure golden color with lots of carbonation within. 2 fingers of fluffy offwhite head. Classic looking beer.

S: Very faint. Some bready malt deep inside. Clean grassy character with light lemon on top. Good pils-ish character.

T: Beery with lots of sweet lemony zest in there. Grass and some sort of light crackery malt. Very refreshing.

F: Light body to match light character.

Overall, I could see drinking a lot of this in steamy Vietnam, or even in the oven that is Shanghai's summer. A good pale-like beer with lots of refreshing character for this corner of the world."

Worst,Amstel Lager,4,"A very good German style pint. Subtle but not at all watery. Very easy drinkable, frankly it has everything a pint needs. It's refreshing, middle of the road without strong characteristics and has a nice aftertaste. It could be the blueprint of pints, but boy do i hate their advertising! Otherwise i'd give it a perfect score!

Drank it straight from a bottle, which makes a lot of difference if you ask me."
Worst,Amstel Lager,1.59,"From a can while on a boat on the Amstel River.

A rather wretched nose with a nauseating grainy note of cooked cereal, corn and a little honey. The palate is worse, with an undrinkable grainy flavor of cooked corn, candy and some cereal. Wretched finish too. Avoid."
Worst,Amstel Lager,2.5,"Cerveza con una buena cabeza espumosa. Es ligera y de una carbonatación media. En aroma se percibe la malta, granos y un poco de limón. En boca es refrescante, ligeramente amarga con un dejo de cebada. Para una cerveza industrial de su precio es una buena opción."
Worst,Amstel Lager,2.62,"This is a 25cL bottle of Amstel's ""AMSTEL BIER"", labeled PIlsener, as packaged for the Dutch Caribbean market, and dated Mrt-19. Served in a tapered tumbler the beer is pale yellow, clear, and forms nearly no head. Aroma has a bit of biscuit malt and skunk. Flavor is mild, with a neutral level of carbonation for the style and very little flavor to bite on the palate. Mostly, but not entirely, inoffensive. And when served absolutely ice cold, it's positively enjoyable after a few hours of snorkeling under the tropical sun. But, this is beeradvocate, not refreshmentadvocate, and as a beer, this just isn't very tasty."
Worst,Amstel Lager,2.79,"A 440ml can with a BB of Aug 2018. Brewed in the UK under contract; ABV is stated as 4.1%. Purchased a while back from Morrisons. The label states that this is brewed according to the Amstel tradition.

A: Poured into a straight pint glass. A crystal-clear golden colour with light carbonation and some vague floating sediment. Forms a decent head of creamy white foam that lasts for a moment or two before collapsing and dissipating.

S: Aroma of faint pale malt with whispers of earthiness and stewed leaves. Almost non-existent. Not flawed but not really beer either....

T: Tastes of very light malt with faint notes of grain, stewed leaves/veg and a twinge of earthiness. Very dry, with little bitterness to speak of. Underwhelming would be an understatement.

M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with prickly carbonation and thin body for the style. Mildly astringent. Aftertaste of harsh stewed leaves and faint malt.

O: A subpar industrial lager. Unimpressive on all fronts. Average looks and body, while the aroma and flavour are bland yet punctuated by subtle off-notes. Barely worth the effort of drinking - give it a miss."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.53,"I had this beer at a friends house this evening. He drinks low alcohol beer because he claims regular beer puts him to sleep. This beer may also put you to sleep because it is boring.

T: pretzels and lemon peel; dry finish with a moderate, peppery-herbal bitterness which lingers long... aftertaste is quite dry, with a toasty pretzel bready essence quietly humming

F: cut dry, tight flow; seems like there's a dextrin plumpness to its body up front, but it just drops in the finish

O: I would not be disappointed if I had to drink this often... it lacks the bubblegum and clove flourishes I've tasted in other Dutch and German NAs... not bad! (1746)"

S- smells of skunk, toasted cereal grains, a hint of spicy hops. Smells like Sugar Smacks cereal

T- slightly sweet malt up front gives notes of toasted grains and puffed wheat cereal. Mid-palate gives notes of cardboard and light skunk. The finish gives just a trace of spicy hops

M- light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish

O- pretty well balanced, some off-putting notes but drinkable"
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.08,"A - Light gold color with good head retention on top.

S - Aroma is very light. Pale malt aroma with just a little bit of hop spiciness.

T - Grain flavor with a little bit of spiciness on the back end, bitterness is low, and the finish is balanced.

M - Light medium body with gentle prickly carbonation that gives way to a soft texture.

O - For a non-alcoholic beer it's better than I expected. For what it is, it hits the mark. Would I buy more? To be determined. Better than the current score of 2.57? Definitely."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.98,"-Clear, golden bottle pour with minimal foam and light aroma of grassy hops. The flavor is thin, but pleasant enough for the style. The finish lacks dryness, which would improve the appeal."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with as Mar-2020 best by date. Sampled on June 17, 2019.

The appearance is a clear golden color with a fizzy white head the dissipates quickly. Great clarity.

Barley grains and All Spice greet the nose with a hint of floral notes and an overall cleanliness.

The mouthfeel is thin, watery, and that is to be expected for a N/A beer in my opinion.

There is a sort of nutmeggy barley grain taste and slightly sweet. Clean, crisp finish. It's a N/A beer I could have more than once if I am trying to avoid alcohol."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.57,"Good news is, this isn't as bitter as other N.A.s out there, but this also means not as much flavour. During the summertime, I can see how this would be a light, refreshing treat. For the other seasons though, I may opt for a heartier cooked brew."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.65,"had next to the new heineken zero alcohol and the coors non alcoholic, and this was better than the coors and much worse than the heineken, more malty and sweet at the end, but unlike the coors, its a reasonable facsimile to real beer if i let it be. i never drink this kind of thing, but i think this one is better than many, it has actual flavor at resembles beer, and that alone makes it decent in its field. clear and yellowish and thin, but it holds its head really well, and looks enough like a light lager. some corny sweetness to it, even an appreciable yeast aspect, its a shame they missed out on any hops, because that seems like the easiest of the core ingredients to assimilate into a non alcoholic brew, it should at least have a balancing element, because without it, the beer finishes sugary and one dimensional, seems like a missed opportunity to me. very light body even with the sweetness, a sort of stale and metallic layer too though, high carbonation saves it for me. i would choose this over many of its peers, but now that they have the new heineken alcohol free beer, this one may take a hit..."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.7,"This is my favorite cheapish near-beer. I can usually find a 6-pack for about $5.50, and for that price, it's well worth it.

Smells like a light beer.

Taste:
Pretty much like any generic lager. It has a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing overbearing.

Overall:
As one of the cheaper, more readily available near-beer's on the market, I really enjoy this one. Tons better than O'Douls, and usually slightly cheaper as well."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.54,"Without going into specifics, I found myself in a situation where the option of ordering a low alcohol beer presented itself. My first ever!
Poured a clear watery color with a piss yellow color background. Little to no head and instantaneously dissipates into nothing.
There was a grainy aroma that was ok, however, there was also an offputting hint of aged cheese, stale tea and sweaty socks. To its credit, this negative aroma did somewhat phase itself out.
The taste was mostly malt forward with a clean lager feel. Not bad, however, there was a bit of astringency to the flavor which didn’t seem to come from hops.
The body is light, watery and fizzy. A bit overcarbonated and a bit rough around the edges in terms of mouthfeel.
So there you have it...my first low alcohol brew. Not terrible but hard to see myself drinking more of this style unless the occasion sonehow presents itself again."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.4,This tastes just like Heineken lager to me and that's a good thing. It's light with a nice citrus flavor and medium head with minimal lacing on the glass. I would recommend this 99 cal glass to anyone who wants a drink before driving.

Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Overall this is a nice NA pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful with great balance of clean pils malt and noble hop flavors. No skunk or off flavors, despite the green bottles. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example.

S=Almost none, but also not off putting.
T=It has been awhile since I've had an NA beer, but, for the style, rather refreshing with minimal of that musty NA flavor. Sweet, slightly malty...definitely more of a session beer.
F=Lighter and ample carbonation.
O=Definitely one of the better NA beers; I recall that imports always beat domestic offerings, and this is no exception."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.11,"Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass.

Pale brass lemon yellow with very good clarity. Very bright bleach white head, managing a good two fingers off the pou, but settles to a simple fine puck and collar. Looks like a better than average industrial beer.

Aroma is quite a bit off putting. Burnt flour like grains predominate the nose. Chalky and powdery burnt residue just get quite a bit of scent on the nose here. Moderate sensing malt sweetness, but hardly much to be contained here.

Surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be on the palate, but still not providing an enjoyable experience. Chalky burnt grains on the palate, with an exceptionally watery mouthfeel. Tap water like body and consistency. A faint touch of a bit of malt sweetness manages to save it just a little. Very odd bitterness that doesn't even feel like hops.

Very strange NA brew, much better out there."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.72,"A nice clear straw colored beer with a white head that lingers around the edge of the glass. The aroma isn't great as it is skunky, grainy and sweet. The taste is grainy and metallic with that skunkiness in it. There is a little bitterness and an odd underlying sweetness. This is not something I enjoy."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,2.09,"Aroma and flavor is a bit of barley/malts, mild fruit and a bitter finish. Not something I'll have again but if I had to have a N.A. beer, this was passable."

This beer poured with a 1 finger head.
It gave off a very slight sweet beer aroma from the head, almost odorless.
The taste was that of beer with overly sweet malt but only slight hops flavor.
The overall taste and body was slightly better than any US light or NA beer with a slight taste of caramel"
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,1.8,"I guess this is the non alcoholic non skunk version of Heineken. Which is like, the best two things about Heineken if you ask me, so I am not sure why this has reason to exist. . . much like a Carver in Lovelock.

Pours a super feint straw yellow. Mild white head 1/3"". The smell wasn't skunky, but was a concerning kind of musty basement.

Taste was a different hopped AAL kind of beer. I dunno. Maybe you're on probation and you've been Eiffel Towered by the whole town and fire department like Chrystal has, so you're relegated to drinking this to drown your sorrows. Like Trump says, its sad, its really sad."
Worst,Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,3.43,"There was a point, a few years back, when I was on a style kick, drinking widely of one style until I either exhausted the available commercial stock or my palate became exhausted. N.A. or Low-Alcohol Beers were one such instance & I was recently surprised to realize that I have not previously reviewed this one. Time to make up for lost time!

From the bottle: ""Premium Quality"".

As usual, nothing happened until I Pop!ped the cap. After that, the brew seemed to fly into my glass, following a heavy-handed pour. This created a brief finger of foamy, bone-white head that withered in the face of the day's heat & humidity. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity. I was surprised when The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas suddenly appeared as I would have thought this to be beneath their mighty gaze. Nope, they just love gold! Nose had a pleasant sugary maltiness to it, leading me to wonder whether it began as a lager or an ale. My bet is on the former. The taste was also decent, with a lager-like sweetness and a touch of Noble hop bitterness. Finish was dry and actually kind of refreshing. For me, it was kind of a novelty treat, but when I first got on an N.A. kick years ago, I had a buddy who could only drink them due to his far out meds. I don't know if he had this one, but I do know that he liked some more than others. This was decent."

Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3,"40oz bottle from the local ""get rid of your DTs"" shop. I walked past multiple (shaking) people looking for the cheapest malt liquor money can buy. I was also factoring in the alcohol-to-price ratio, but alas, it wasn't needed: the cheapest beer also had the most alcohol. A foil labeled 40 called Side Pocket High Gravity

Getting back I notice it's from Wisconsin, so my expectations are raised slightly. Those 'sconnies know their beer. I didn't pour it into a glass because I'm not a heathen. Was expecting to have to chase swigs of it with bites of leftover pizza, but the taste actually isn't that bad. It's overly sweet and corny, but I was expecting that. No hint of alcohol except in the mouthfeel and in the burps, and I actually taste hops!

Buy this. Beer make you drunk"
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.49,"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of very light malts, not a lot there.

Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.57,"Very typical clear gold with minimal head and no retention or lacing. Rousing carbonation that settled after a bit.

The usual high gravity lager smells...corn and metallic.

Taste was more of the same..sweet, alcoholic and fairly smooth. Best when cold.

Mouthfeel was a step above water.

Just another cheap beer for a hot summer evening..I bought it out of sheer curiosity and because I really needed a quick buzz after a rough day."
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.85,"40 oz bottle poured into juice glass. No brown paper bag present.

Looks like carbonated urine.

It tastes and smells remarkably similar to a very cheap white wine. There's not a lot of bitterness, it's all just corn and alcohol.

Plenty of alcohol in the aftertaste. Smooth enough, though.

Hello friend. Would you like to get very drunk? Drink this."
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.79,"40 oz bottle. 1000th review.

Straight form the bottle (though I poured most of it for someone else). It pours a deep gold with a fluffy white head that dissipates moderately quickly.

Smells like corny mead. Lots of honey and alcohol and caorn in the scent.

The flavor is pretty shitty. On the front end it isn't bad, mild grain and hops but on the back end it is adjuncty and sickly sweet.

The mouthfeel is prickly at first then seems watery.

This is just a malt liquor contract brewed by a nearly anonymous and small marketing agency. Who knows it might share recipes with other or just have a minor tweak, it is run of the mill."
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,3.2,"40oz bottle in a paper bag generally contributed by joshuaseresse. This is the last of the malt liquors left over from the malt liquor tasting earlier this summer. Served in a Cantillon glass - how's that for cognitive dissonance?

A - A finger of white foam settles to a thick collar, but no lace. There are streams of tiny bubbles rising throughout the dark urine-colored body.

S - Grape juice, fructose, caramel, grain, light fusel alcohol when it warms up but not too bad for the style.

T - Sugar, corn, white grape juice, cereal grains. Alcohol is surprisingly well-hidden, although this verges on cloying sweet after a few ounces.

M - Lower carbonation, medium-bodied, some grain to the texture, and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish.

D - This is actually pretty solid, and one of the better takes on the style that I've had. This one is a little bit too sweet for me to tackle the whole 40oz bottle. Not quite as good as Stack, as this one is lower in alcohol but doesn't taste any better."
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,2.28,"Appearance: Pours a clearish, golden-toned body with a frothy, short-lived, white head.

Smell: Sweet-scented, chemically aroma of cooked corn, boiled apple cores, and melted sugars.

Taste: Starts off sweet, with tastes of substandard grains and sugar-dosed corn meal. Hint of fruitiness somewhat reminiscent of apples. As with so many (okay, almost all) of these malt liquors, it has that troubling, potentially-flammable chemical taste to it. Finishes near-hot, sweet, and chemical coated.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Ugh. About as bad as any other malt liquor, so, if nothing else, these things are fairly consistent. The name does at least suit the beverage."
Worst,Side Pocket High Gravity Ale,1.51,"The CAN identified the beer as an ale of the high gravity variety. I am unsure about its veracity, but what CAN I do? Onward!

I briefly got a finger of bone-white head before it dissipated into nothingness. Color was a deep golden-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was ungodly sweet underlain by a sharp alcohol quality. I remain suspect about this being an ale. Mouthfeel was medium with a very sugary taste on the tongue and suddenly it hit me - this tasted like Colt 45, an American Malt Liquor, which is a Lager-style. Who's zoomin' who, here? I am going to leave it simply because the CAN read ""Ale"" and I am in no position to argue. The finish had a unpleasant tobacco taste, like I was sniffing around an ashtray. Ooof. The really bad part is that it came in a 24-ounce CAN and I hated to do a drain pour. I didn't with Chelada, a recent ""F"" and I chose to bravely press on. Awful."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.4,"Crap beer. Can u even call it beer.

Smell -Citrus, malt, apple.

Taste - Citrus, sweet, apple, crisp, sour, tangy after taste that activates the back end of the tongue.

Feel - Light, coats the pallet for a shot time, crisp.

Overall -A great summer beer that is easily drinkable, not watery, not skunky, very well priced if you’re local."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1,This is disgusting !! The worst beer I’ve ever opened! It smells like apple cider vinegar and tastes like it !! I threw out an 8 pack because it was so disgusting
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.57,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Very busy but kind of charming. It has a sort of simple 90s aesthetic to it. It's not the most beer-looking, but I like it.

Smell - Sweet and malty, very powerful smell for an adjunct lager. Smells more like a German dunkel almost. A good smell but on the verge of overpowering.

Taste - The taste more or less follows the smell. Very sweet, very bready, somewhat of a caramel taste. Could use with some more bitterness to tone it down, but it's got a character that I've never experienced in this style.

Feel - A weird creamy/soapy texture. Not entirely pleasant. Could definitely use with a bit more carbonation.

Overall - Never heard of this beer and have only seen it in one random store, but for a $3 six-pack, this was a good pick. Way more interesting than most other adjunct lagers, might come back to it if I can find it again."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.57,"12oz can coded (17 285 19) poured into a perfect pint at fridge temp. Beer is bright straw yellow with minimal white head and no lacing. Even the perfect pint with a nucleation point could only keep a head on this a few minutes. Aroma is an odd mix of malt and chemical. Taste normal for an adjunct lager but there is a bad lingering bitter after taste that is not hop driven. Mouthfeel is poor with sharp carbonation and a burning sensation to the tongue. After swallowing, there is a thick persistent oily/soapy feeling that doesn't go away. Overall, this beer is flawed at the basics. I was hoping for a cheap lawnmower beer but this is not okay, even judged only against other AAL."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.69,"A typical grainy blonde lager pour with a surprising soapy and foamy head of three fingers. Haze is present, in fact it bumps the opacity to near 30%.

Smells of cheerios, or other breakfast cereal, cut bananas, and malty grain. Actually an excellent nose.

HOLY SWEETNESS BATMAN. It's like someone dumped sugar in my beer. The banana runt flavor is there, which I like, but then it turns cloyingly bad with lumps of sugar and malt mix. A pine stab very faintly finishes out the profile, but it barely pushes through the overwhelming sweetness in this beer. Notes of banana linger through the end.

Creamy yet still carbonated, but nothing exceptional. A little sticky in a bad way. Ends wet.

Overall this beer was way too sweet, I don't think I could do two of these in a row. Someone who drinks the 24 packs it comes in is probably prediabetic. I've had fruit beers less sweet than this."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.53,"Sampled last night on 9/10/15. Comes in a 12-ounce can that I paid 99 cents from ""No Frills"" on Wednesday. Can chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled-glass stein ""CHEERS-BOSTON"" glass.

Brew pours a deep-golden yellow in color with a good 1-finger foamy/creamy head. Decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. Aroma is of sweet grain for the most part. Pretty much is said for the taste with LOTS of sweetness I am guessing from the grain they used. Too much actually. Funny that several times on the can they mention: ""Craft Brewed in Small Batches"" with a website with the three ""W's"" followed by ""DamnGoodBeer"" dot com. Well...OK then. LOL! Gonna say they they must like their own ""Craft Brewed in Small Batches"" better than myself (and many others) with all the comments here. Anyway, just a one time try for me for sure.

Not at all bad, very drinkable, and if it came in glass 40oz bottle, I couldn't make the promise I'd never buy it again."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.68,"Pours golden with a thin white head that has decent retention. Some lacing sticks.

The smell is of an average cheap macro lager. Something raw in the smell, though.

The taste is of grain, chemical, and alcohol.

The feel is slick with solvent alcohol. It does have a certain crispness to it though.

For $3 a six-pack, I figured that I would try it. It's worth spending just a little more for Miller High Life, in my opinion. This reminds me of a cheap malt liquor light. It's not good - it's actually pretty bad, but not horrible for some reason. Well, a rated it for what it is. It is what it is."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.58,"Oh joy! The CANQuest (TM) is on the (fast) approach to CAN Review # 1,000 and local, in-person trader, tone77, has laid this gem on me to help speed the plow.

Our gold medalist brewmaster ferments only the finest sun-ripened hops & two-row malted barley to create this crisp, clean, classic lager.""

Every fiber of my being cried, ""Liars!"" as I typed that out. I know what is coming and it won't be pretty. I just bought a 30-pack of Olde Frothingslosh and their level of seriousness is more deserving of any Minhas product, if you CAN call them ""beers"".

The Crack! revealed a brimful CAN, so maybe everyone is starting to get in on the fun. The inverted Glug was perfect, evincing a pseudo-cascade and forming approximately three fingers of dense, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with moderate retention. Color was a deep-gold (SRM = &gt; 5, &lt; 7) with NE-quality clarity and suddenly, across from me were the unholy trio of Midas, Mammon and Croesus, all wanting a taste. Usually, I would allow them to waste time in-fighting and begin drinking it myself, but I was in no hurry here and allowed them the first draughts. While they were on the floor, rolling around, coughing and gagging, I leaned in for a sniff. Minhas strikes again! It was their usual melange of plastics factory, dry cleaning plant, chewed pink bubble gum, unripe green apples and cotton CANdy. Ugh. The sound of heavy footsteps in the alley signaled the return of the Cybermen, here to subsume me into their midst by dint of drinking a product unfit for human CANsumption. I took my first drink and allowed it to roll around in my mouth, on my tongue, if for no other reason that my gag reflex was kicking in and I could not bear to swallow. It tasted like fermented hell. I was getting notes of stale tobacco to go along with all of the other off flavors and I began to curse NickD717 for starting me on this CAN Kick. Just then, the fence collapsed out back and the Cybermen began their advance on my house. Another long draught and when I looked down, my hands were encased in metallic gloves, just as my feet were in heavy metal boots. It had begun again! At one point, I had CANsumed enough Minhas products to develop a tolerance and an immunity to this sort of thing, but I have been CANfining myself to better beers of late, eschewing AALs and this was the result. Decent lacing began to form in my glass and it occurred to me that I might need to jackhammer it loose later, if I survived. Fortunately, all of my past encounters with the Cybermen had brought me to the attention of both Doctor Who and Torchwood and they had left a model of K-9 with me for future such encounters. K-9 appeared from his dormancy in my living room and began to repel the Cybermen as I choked, gagged and chugged down what was in my glass. Remember, no drain pours on The CANQuest (TM), if it is to count. The finish was raw, semi-dry, but in an unfinished way. It was as though it had not entirely fermented or the process had gone horribly, horribly wrong. Just as I finished it off, the Cybermen went into retreat and I got my insurance agent on the phone to get yet another new fence. I may start sending the bills for replacement fences to Monroe, Wisconsin ..."

Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not as bad as some of there beers, is nothing special."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,3.66,"I don't know who these dudes are, but anyone who would even attempt to get serious about critiqueing a typical american pilsner that is mass produced is missing the boat. Call them craft beers if you wish, but that would be like calling Bud Lite, or Miller Draft, or Coors craft beers. If all beers were bitter that would get a little boring don't you think? And I certainly would not be bold enough to suggest how breweries should change their beers to suit my personal tastes. If they were foolish enough to do so we would have how many varieties of beer on the planet earth? Let me answer that question for you. The answer I believe is obviously...one.
I happen to like beers that are malty. It's my favorite characteristic in a beer. I also like sweetness in a beer. Mountaincrest not only has a deeper color than most typical american lagers, it also has a stronger, bolder flavor which makes it most desirable. Foaming characteristics? Who cares? Most beer drinkers don't drink the foam and actually wait for it to dissipate. Nose? You've GOT to be kidding! When is the last time you worried about the smell of a Miller Lite? I not only like the taste of MountainCrest, I think it is one of the better tasting beers in the store. College kids should be going nuts over this stuff. And the price is definitely a plus for beer drinkers that like quantity.
I heard that MountainCrest and Boxer are actually the same beer. Not as far as I could tell. The boxer looked paler in color and weaker in taste. Although I must admit I did not try them side by side. I'm sure it won't be too difficult to find out. Still, $12.99 for 36 cans translates into 36 cents a can. If there is anyone out there that is beating that price let us know!"
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.75,"This poured out as a pale looking yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The head settles into nothingness and leaves no head retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is loaded with malt sweetness much like most of the Minhas brews. The taste of the beer is mostly all malt, no bitterness at all, it's very one dimensional. The mouthfeel is light bodied, carbonated and watery, very boring. Overall this beer needs a lot more of a bitterness to it. It's far too sweet and really needs some bitterness to balance it out."
Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,2.75,"Mountain Crest (Mountain Creek or Minhas Creek) has a medium, quickly dissipating head, some splotchy lacing, and a clear, bubbly golden appearance. The aroma is of sickly-sweet green apples and musty grain. The flavor is of sweet, Jolly Rancher apple-flavored candy, tartness, grain, and a dash of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Mountain Crest finishes harsh, ragged, and unpleasant (to an extent). Overall, this is, at best, an average beer, but it does has some character, even it it's a bad character. Try it, but you'll probably not like it.

Worst,Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,1.29,"Reviewed from notes.

A. Transparent pee-yellow with a short lived foam collar, no real lacing at all to speak of.

S. Smells like apple/pear juice mixed with simple syrup sweetener from a bar dispenser.

T. Rotting potatoes, sugary sweetness combined with acidic vomitous bile, with a very long extended rusty metal finish. Wow. If it were possible to rate a zero out of five I would without hesitation. Seriously, a very pervasive rotten potatoes flavor either speaks for an infected can or a very terrible beer.

M. Light, thin and watery, but not quite carbonated enough to clear the metallic / acid haze from my mouth.

Oh dear lord, this one was really quite terrible. I recommend staying the hell away from this ""beer"". Even if I had happened to get some kind of infected can, I am not willing to subject myself to the contents of another on the off-chance that it might be better, that was how bad it was. It is just not worth the risk."

Looks are decent enough - a slightly reddish, golden color. Lively carbonation to the eye.

The aroma is a muddle of wheat bread, vague fruit notes, medicinal, a little yeasty. It is not fresh or inviting in the smell.

The taste falls far short of expectation. The base beer seemed off somehow, and the cranberry flavor seems artificial and medicinal. Some sweetness, some tart from the cranberry, but it is pretty much a muddle of indistinguishable and unremarkable flavors.

The feel - this looked pleasantly carbonated, but it is quite bloating and very harsh on the tongue. Some of the sting is cranberry, but it seems to be carbonated with very small bubbles that become uncomfortable.

Overall, this is a poor representation of a lambic and is generally a poorly constructed beer against what sounds like a good concept - good idea, bad execution?"
Worst,Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,1.83,"Quite the abomination to what could be considered a lambic. Right up there with some super failed homebrew attempts at lambic.

Did you want a cranberry vodka? Because thats you get when you order a cranberry lambic. The aroma is wheat-esque.

Taste is nothing like a lambic. This is a bad beer by any standard, but damn if you didn't call it a lambic. They just dumped a bunch of cranberry juice into a wheat beer. Homebrew surprise all over this one. good for nothing. Acidic, I'd rather drink juice."
Worst,Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,1.15,"This is the worst ""beer"" I've ever had in my life. I first had it when I was a depraved college kid who would play Edward 40 hands wth OE and still could not finish a bottle of this garbage. For years I thought all ""lambics"" were terrible because this garbage that I got in a Sam Adams sampler pack. I've since grown and learned the virtues of true sour beers and even more so want this to f--- off. It's not a lambic, it's a crap wheat beer with horrid cranberry flavoring and maple syrup that do not go at all and are not even a fraction as good as it sounds, in fact it's awful. The fact that this beer continues to exist would make aliens, if they existed, not want to land here because the world does not make sense and is too scary because this garbage swill continues to be sold to the masses rather than used to torture prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. You prevent the growth of America's youth by selling this garbage as ""craft"" beer, thereby ensuring a country of Bud drinking drones. If I could punch this beer in the face i would. I poured this down the drain to drink a bottle of Mohawk vodka instead because it was a better alternative. Burn in Hell, you POS ""beer"".

Color ok, mouthfeel ok, taste a--.

I'm surprised you named your company Sam Adams, not Benedict Arnold because your sewage swill has been a traitor to my mouth.

F U and F your entire family for making this wretch."
Worst,Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,1.95,"Piss poor excuse for a beer. I sincerely hope the Boston beer company listens to its customers and removes this product from the shelves of the beer consumer. It should instead be placed with the insect repellant. I believe flies wouldn't be foolish enough to attempt consuming this monstrosity. Also, don't lie to the consumer, you made a generic beer and put cranberry juice in it. This beer... this beverage is as close to lambic as the titanic is to successful."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,5,"Love this beer!!! It is a great beer from Iron City... Come on it's Soo much better than iron City. It's a fun beer and it's Soo sad that Iron City does a poor job marketing this! I also feel it's very sad that the local places don't carry it and that it is sooooo very hard to get it at PNC Park, Heinz and PPG... Come on it's a freaking local beer, it's good show your support!!!!!"
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.37,"Amber lager, deeper color than a light beer. Fruit straight away, mango definitely. Sweet to start the slow to sour. Carbonated but then quickly to a traditional light beer. Overall a yummy summer beer, will keep on hand for hot days."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,4.69,"this one slaps beyond belief. top tier beverage for sure. if you dont back this brew, i honestly dont know why. quit lying to yourself. it slaps. fools need a lesson on good beer lmaooo"
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.92,"Went down as smooth as butter, very tasty as well. Yum! Could be a little sweeter. Tastes like flavoured water. Mango very fresh. Pretty ic look, tastes fire. It would have a better rating if they made shirts for it, I’ll give you guys a 5 if you send me a shirt"
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.55,"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet mango. Taste is mango, some grains, sweet, but not as much as the aroma would have suggested. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall this is one of the better beers I have had both from this style and this brewery."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.04,"A- Bland gold with half finger head that dissipates quickly.

S- pungent mango with minimal malt

F- sweet mango with watered down feel

M- watery and light and mango

O- better than expected."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,2.23,"Pale gold color with zero head. Lots of clarity.

Aroma is of moldy broccoli, stewed beets, and mango puree.

The initial/base flavor is really awful, like used chewing tobacco, but it's entirely grainy. Then a nice mango flavor comes in - whether it's artificial or real, I guess it doesn't matter, because it takes over the nasty flavor so it's a welcome arrival. The finish is of mango/grapefruit lozenge. A general rotten flavor sustains throughout the profile.

Feel is nonexistent. Just very thin, empty. Clean though. Nice carbonation. Light chalkiness.

Overall, much less impressive than the Berry flavor. I didn't like this one at all."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.12,"Pittsburgh Brewing Co. ""I.C. Light Mango""
12 fl. oz. clear glass bottle. Ink Jet packaging information is worn and illegible.
$2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA

The label for Pittsburgh Brewing Co.'s I.C. Light mango is basically the recipe: it's I.C. Light with ""NATURAL FLAVORS AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS"" added. That sound a little bit harsh, but it actually gives it pleasant, and surprisingly realistic mango flavor. The only surprise is that it's also lightly skunked ~ and I'm assuming it's only lightly skunked because there aren't that many hops in there to begin with. Still, it doesn't come across as ""sweet"", even with the additional sweeteners. It's an interesting and enjoyable light beer that would be perfect for summer, and at just 3.8% ABV you could drink a few if you wanted to. A very good entry into the fruited light beer category."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,3.29,My senior manager brought a 4pck from PA. It was 95F with high humidity today with real feel being 103F.....this tasted awesome. It poured a golden clear with initial white head that eventually dissapated leaving no lace. The scent was mango. The taste was light beer with mango flavoring....bordering a shandy. The Mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it's decent and great on warmer days
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,2.83,"Drank the pale straw liquid straight out of the clear bottle. Even through the small opening, I could smell the essence of mango. This offering also tastes like mango but it also borders on being soda with some alcohol mixed into it."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,2,"I really cant say anything positive about this beer, except that its a beer that I crave once and awhile in the hot humid PA summers. Good beer to drink if someone else has bought it."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,2.75,"(Served in a strange)

A- 3 This beer pours a crystal clear hue of straw yellow with a pale white head of big bubbles that is soon gone but supported by a racing carbonation.

S- 3 The dry aroma of mango jolly ranchers is all the comes through although it remains soft.

T- 3 The light dry mango flavor is ripe with a soft dry candy and powdery flavor in the finish.

M- 2.5 The medium mouthfeel has a spicy soda pop fizz that cuts any flavor and cleans the finish.

O- 2.5 The soft mango note is nice but that is all there is and it is more like soda pop that beer."
Worst,I.C. Light Mango,2.5,"Enjoyed this bottled brew out a large snifter glass.

A: Pours a golden hue with a minimal white head that quickly dissipates.

S: Fruity mango aroma.

T: yep – fruity mango flavor too.

M: Medium body and medium carbonation.

O: Just an ok fruity brew."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,4.94,I fell in love with this Lager while spending my vacation in Cordoba Spain. It had the perfect amount of bitterness to bring out great flavor. Not a heavy beer at all. Really wish I could get this beer in th U.S.A.
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,2.43,"On tap in Malaga (also: ubiquitous all over Andalucia). Served in a half pint (imperial) glass. Beer pours crystal clear and yellow in color, with moderate foaming from the tap, but no head retention worth mentioning. Negligible aroma. Flavor is... off-crisp? Not dry or flavorful, and only a little bit of cereal sweetness to offend the senses. Bad, but not horrible. Still, it's got enough to it to cut through greasy fried Cazon or Flamenquin (as was the case for me tonight), which I suppose is the whole point. I didn't take much in the way of notes on the various draught beers I sampled in Spain, but I suspect Alhambra Especial was the clear winner among the few."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,1.75,"330ml can. Flute glass. Pale gold color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, brief crown, no lacing. Sugar & malt extract aromas. Cloying sweet upfront followed by floral & earthy bitterness. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Watery texture. Sweet/bitter finish. Flat & boring. No off-flavors are shown."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,1.8,"Pours gold with a quickly dissipating white head.
Nose shows vegetal and hay notes, along with faint spicy hops.
Similar flavours, mostly sweet hay with some faint cardboard and metallic notes.
Watery body.
Just another generic Euro lager really."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,3.42,"330ml bottle, poured into San Miguel glass. Golden colour, two finger head, clear. Smelled yeasty, notes of malt and citrus, not what I expected but nice. Fairly sweet taste, wheaty finish. Mouthfull was normal without too much carbonation. I thought this was decent for what it is, a crisp refreshing lager would go down well on a hot day in Spain."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,3.94,"On holiday in tenerife. Chilled 33cl bottle poured into a wine glass.

A- Golden body with lively beading, gives a solid creamy 2 finger head with an aggressive pour. This reduces quickly to leave some lace and a steady crown.

S- Smell is moderate bitter aroma hops dominating, not much malt note.

T- Gentle hint of malt with a solid hop bite in the finish which lingers well. Its crisp and clean.

M- Moderate carbonation and body.

D- A much better experience than the last time i tried Cruzcampo. Perhaps they get better stuff in Spain ;). Certainly a crisp clean lager with a good hop bite. For me, definitely one of the better Spanish mass produced golden lagers."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,2.88,"I had this beer at Milano in Madrid.

Cruzcampo pours a clear golden color, and is topped by a white head that eventually fades to a film leaving good lace. The aroma is pretty plain: lager sweetness, graininess, and grassy and peppery hops.

This beer starts out with the standard grainy/sweet lager taste, and then moves into a mildy bitter finish that has a small dose of grassy hops. This beer is light-bodied, moderately carbonated, and crisp.

Overall this was better than some of the other lagers we had, but it was still pretty generic."
Worst,Cruzcampo Lager,2.88,"Consumed aboard Delta flight from Madrid, Spain to JFK.

Poured a medium straw hue with a one finger frothy white head. There was decent retention and good lacing.

The smell was dominated by sweet adjunct grain and metal.

The taste consisted of a light corn sweetness, some doughy malts and a subtle floral hop.

The mouthfeel was toward the milkier side of the style.

Overall not something I would try again out of the can."
Worst,Schaefer,3.08,"This isn’t bad for an adjunct lager. It looks like p*ss and smells similar. Has a corniness on the nose and a bright yellow color. It tastes good, though. Very smooth and not cloying. Can’t beat it for $17.49 a 30 pack!"
Worst,Schaefer,2.48,"310 ml can (10.5 oz). Label says ""Puerto Rico"" on it, not sure why as the label also indicates it was brewed in Milwaukee.

drank on the beach in St John USVI so all that mattered was that it was wet and cold. not much more to say, very mild pale malt flavor, thin and fizzy mouthfeel."
Worst,Schaefer,2.18,"Light refreshing, for tinted water, and very mild. This thing drinks quick, inoffensive, and utterly forgettable. There is nothing off here just simple light lager. If you’re hot and thirsty go for it."
Worst,Schaefer,2.53,"A 12 oz. can poured into a clear pint glass shows a very pale straw colored, almost clear liquid. There's very little head, glass lacing, nor aroma. There is some taste, but it's mostly yeasty. Considering the category, at least there is some taste. This brand probably tasted better decades ago. The Puerto Rican version definitely was."
Worst,Schaefer,3.22,"**Mandatory discussion based on trying a few 6-packs years in the past.

Schaefer was one of the brews available from regional brewers when I lived in Madison WI from 1973-78. IMO even that many years ago, Schaefer was not that popular b/c there were too many other options available and the taste and smell were for diehard fans only.

Around 1977 or so, Miller Lite came on the local scene and took a huge market away from the regional brews like Schaefers."
Worst,Schaefer,1.45,Tastes like the metal bleachers of the stadium that used to bear its name. Literally any other beer would be better than this. The one beer to have when you’re having more than one. No thanks. I’ll have none.
Worst,Schaefer,2.75,"Drank a lot in college, stole a lot from my Dad. 4.6% great session brew! None of the floral I remember. Rather corny taste, decent bitter. Ok for cheap beer."
Worst,Schaefer,2.86,"Best by 7/22/19

Pours a golden straw topped with an ample thick white foam; slowly receding retention leaves layers of splotchy lacing and a fading cap and collar.

Aromas show muddled grainy notes and some fresh straw with a minor corn sweetness almost overshadowed entirely by an oncoming presence of grassy hops; bouquet has a quiet pop to it.

Taste lots of grain and a light honeyed sweetness throughout the profile, while grassy hops come in late to give a rounded quality; finishes quickly with hints of a somewhat unpleasant metallic tone lingering.

Mouthfeel holds a light body that holds nicely until the back end, where it becomes a bit watery; smooth carbonation with a progressive prickle on the palate and a decent crispness overall; finish thins and fades quickly.

Solid, essentially inoffensive AAL with a developing grain character and reinforcing hoppy prickle; somewhat inconsistent overall to be a go-to, but I'd have no problem returning to this one if the situation called for it."
Worst,Schaefer,2.25,"Another high school and college era beer. Was never the first, second or even third choice. But it was readily available and cheap. Again, not the worst i've drank, but easily closer to the bottom than the top."
Worst,Schaefer,1.45,"If I am looking to quench a thirst and only beer will do, I will drink it. My cheap brother in law keeps a few six packs in the garage fridge, so I am occasionally forced to drink it when me and the missus swing by...... If you want bland, this is YOUR beer!"
Worst,Schaefer,4,"Been drinking this on and off longer than I care to remember. It tastes like ""BEER"". And that's a good thing. Schaefer is one of those beers I'll have as my first beer of the day along with being one of my backyard beers. Can't beat $8.50 for a 12 pack. Get some!"
Worst,Schaefer,3.47,"Another beer that defined the look, taste, and smell of ""beer"" for me back in my twenties. I drank a lot of this in college, when it was the cheapest beer that tasted decent. Once again, can't find it anymore around here, but I would buy it if I could."
Worst,Schaefer,2.56,"So this is the famous Schaefer Beer, which my dad used to sell in his New York bar in the seventies but now is brewed in far off Wisconsin. Yay corporations?

Schaefer actually pours well and looks good, with legit head and lace, even for a non macro. Nose is corny and grainy.

Broad, grainy flavor with a touch of noble hops, but not much. Heavy texture, but not too carbonated. This is basic, blue collar beer, the kind of which working people have quaffed in this country and the old world for hundreds of years. It is also macro produced, corporate nonsense. Glad I tried a local legend but at eighty cents a twelver more than Natty Boh and almost a buck and a half more than PBR, probably not going to be gracing my fridge again anytime soon."
Worst,Schaefer,3,I know the macros are not a favorite on this site but I do enjoy going to one from time to time. I would say this your average macro nothing great but not awful either.
Worst,Schaefer,2.16,"How many beers currently on the market have as much history as Schaefer? Unfortunately, that rich history led to it being brewed by Pabst, ripping it from the Brooklyn beer scene. Still, some brands acquired by Pabst (e.g. Ballantine) remain impressive (at least for their price), so I'm optimistic going in.

A 12 pack cost me $10.49 plus tax and deposit at a beer distributor in NYC. The box is pretty nondescript, relying on its now diluted brand instead of playing up the retro vibe. Still, there's an old-timey straightforwardness to the (lack of) marketing that endears me to it, evoking a sort of ""your grandfather's brand"" vibe.

The can is just as nondescript, its only graphic design flourish the placement of the beer's name inside a red oval. ""America's oldest lager beer"" (I guess Yuengling's lawyers are looking the other way on this one). ""Established in the United States 1842."" 12 fl oz format. Standard pull-tab.

APPEARANCE: Clean depleted copper body. Off-white fizzy head. Retention is poor given the ABV - maybe 1 minute.

Dull and sad in appearance, lacking any vibrance or life. But it's filtered and yeast-free.

AROMA: Corn adjunct. Pils malts. 2-row barley. A hint of syrupy sweetness.

Corn dominates. Some grassy hop aromatics or some graininess would be nice; this bends a bit too sweet, suggesting an imbalanced brew. Still, the aroma suggests it has more body than your standard thin watery adjunct lager, so I guess....I'm hopeful?

Aromatic intensity is low. No off-notes are detectable, nor is any overt booze.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Syrupy sweet throughout, though it does hit on a blip of graininess right on the finish that's a little more dry. Elsewise, it's medium-bodied, syrupy, overly thick and lumpy for an adjunct lager, and unrefreshing. Smooth and wet until the finish. Overcarbonated, though not as egregiously so as many adjunct lagers.

It's inoffensive in terms of taste, but that requires you to get past the syrupy sticky mouthfeel (which is a tall order). Not grainy enough, with sweet corn adjunct leading the pack (and the rest of the dogs in that pack are all tired sick hounds: stale 2-row, generic pale malt). Water is minerally and seems a bit hard for an adjunct lager.

No real hop flavours whatsoever; I search for the usual blip of grassy hop flavour but it's absent.

I'll take a watery thin body over a syrupy sticky one like this 9 times out of 10. To say this is simple and shallow is an understatement; it's one of the most neutral beers on the market...and therein may lie (or have lay) its appeal. It's drinkable and dull, not demanding one's attention. I guess it wouldn't distract from food, and might pair well with spicy Mexican food that would blast your palate with chili heat anyway.

OVERALL: Giving credit where it's due, there are no off-flavours here; it's not metallic, I find no DMS/diacetyl/brettanomyces/acetaldehyde, and the alcohol isn't overt. In that sense, ""inoffensive"" may be the biggest compliment I can give it. But inasmuch as budget macrolagers go, I'd opine most drinkers are better off going with Rolling Rock, Miller High Life, or the like (assuming one wouldn't cross into budget ale territory with Ballantine, Gennesee, or the like). I'm impressed Pabst can brew this consistently on the scale they do, but it's far from amongst the best beers in the style.

I tip my hat to the brand's history, but this won't attract casual drinkers or discerning drinkers, and is best left on shelves to let the brand continue dying its slow death.

D (2.11) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
2nd impression:

High D / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,Schaefer,3,"A brief perusal of youtube comments tells me that septuagenarians who use the term ""new age"" derisively think this beer is awesome. To me, it joins the ranks of Natty Boh, Strohs, and Stag as Beers that Are Probably Just PBR in a Different Can.

Which is to say, it's not flavorless or bad so much as it just doesn't have any distinguishing characteristics. It might be a bit creamier than those other beers, but the grain and hop profile is basically identical.

And, please, spare me: this brewed by Pabst. It might not be listed in their official brand portfolio, but its website is identical to all the other acquired and neglected pabst retro brands. It's also brewed in the same facility. So... yeah, same okay product, different container."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.93,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts. Taste is very mild, some light grains. Feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is mediocre. I would say it's really no better, or worse, than most beers in this style."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,3.38,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no bottling or best by date shown. This one is brewed in the USA. Sampled on August 18, 2017.

The look is pale yellow, great clarity, and a quick lasting burst of fizzy white head then nothing.

For a light adjunct this has some aromatic qualities including corn, rice, sweetness, and grassy hops.

The body is thin and watery however.

The taste also brings out a pleasant enough corn and rice sweetness. Not the syrupy kind. With a clean, crisp, and slightly zingy, grassy finish. I/m not a light beer fan but this one is easy to consume."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,1.67,"A very light and bland beer, almost no flavor at all because it's too watery, not much to smell either. I'd prefer a macro light beer over one of these."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.87,"you know, as much as this shouldnt be the case here, this light i think is better than their reserve all malt brew, which despite being lagered longer, really is a total mess. this is a clean and crisp, if albeit a little adjuncty, its dry as they come, and quite refreshing in the right context. easy drinking yellow beer, lots of bubbles, and basically no aftertaste. the malt is in the front, a touch starchy, is their rice in this? maybe corn, as there is a moment of that flavor up front too, and even a detectable pinch of grassy almost stale tasting hops, but it doesnt have any of the weird lager yeast flavor the reserve has, and with the freakishly low abv, its a real crusher. save more room in the gut for the sushi right? after a recent trip to puerto rico, i feel like my palate for light lagers has evolved a lot, or maybe got back up to speed with what these are supposed to taste like, and as much as i dislike the style, i have to acknowledge when i find a decent one, and this one in many respects is ahead of its peers. take it or leave it."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.51,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 09Mar15) into a pilsner glass.
LOOK: Pours with a half finger's worth of white foam that shrivels down into a line after 45 seconds. Rising bubbles are medium sized and are moderate in number. Straw yellow in color. Lacing is thin and moderate, but stays on the sides of the glass.
SMELL: Has subtle aromas of rice and and hints of bitter and spicy hops. This hardly smells like anything.
TASTE: Mild aromas of rice malts enter intially and are immediately followed by mild bitter and spicy hops.
FEEL: Light-bodied and so carbonated, that it burns my tongue. Goes down rough and had a thirst-quenching finish.
NOTE: Incredibly well-balanced. Doesn't make it any better tasting, though."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,1.33,"A simply horrible beer, if one could call it a beer. Regular Sapporo is bad enough but I guess the brewers felt like they could do even worse....they were right. Appearance is about what you'd expect from a light beer, pale with barely any color, as if you mixed a spoonful of beer in a glass full of water. Lingering and repulsive acidic taste, flat and empty body even for a light beer. Aroma not completely repugnant but it's nothing that a beer should smell like as it is absent of any trace of fundamental beer ingredients. Smells more like sake without the alcohol. If you like beer made from rice I guess this won't be the worst thing you could drink but don't expect quality here."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.68,"A - Clear gasoline yellow. Light finger of head

S - Average for the style. Lightly astringent but much better than adjunct beers.

T - Slightly boring. Flavor is heavily dependent on the malts themselves. Not much hopping or roasting and no esters to speak of

M - The best part of the experience. It is a thick malty beer. They call it light but I'm curious what the calorie level actually it to achieve this mouth feel.

O - This is an ok beer if you're in the mood for something bland and thick. You can pick up a 6pack around these parts for less than $8. I needed some extra bottles for a batch I'm brewing and this was about this same price as buying bottles."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.27,"pale golden yellow in color. Clear in appearance. rice, simple malt and wet cardboard. Goes perfectly well spice Thai food. Besides that, it's pretty flavorless. Refreshing."
Worst,Sapporo Light Beer,2.83,"Pours to a fine white head and minimal lacing. Color is pale gold. Aroma is vegetal DMS, pale malt and a hint of noble hops. Flavor is crisp and light with a nondescript grain flavor and clean finish. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Overall a typical light low-cal lager."
Worst,Kalik,2.55,"My son brought me this from his recent trip to the Islands with his honey. Poured from a bottle and into a beer mug. This beer is has a light golden color with a little head. The aroma was really skunky and it followed through to the taste. All in all, it was not a good beer for my taste. I will not be trying this again, unless there is nothing else to drink."
Worst,Kalik,2.98,"12oz clear glass bottle. Poured out a crystal clear, straw-yellow color with a small, white head of foam. It left some lacing on the glass. It smelled of caramel, toasted corn and floral notes. Sweet caramel taste with cracker, sweet breads and a very mild bitterness."
Worst,Kalik,2.18,"When in the Bahamas, do as the Bahamians do -- and drinking an islander not named ""corona"" seemed like a good deal to me on vacation just a few weeks ago. Like a lot of things in life, it may look good but things can get a bit crazy once you actually commit: a lot of skunk from this guy and a bit harsh on the mouth, but not a bad overall taste. Not the worst, but definitely, DEFINITELY, not the best."
Worst,Kalik,1.15,This beer had a sweetness about it I just didn't like. It was also kind of cloudy. Not sure why a AAL would be cloudy. I would take about any other AAL over this one.
Worst,Kalik,2.5,"I had one on tap while on my honeymoon in the Bahamas. It was watery and inoffensive. It is typical to its style (an island AAL), so I wouldn't penalize it for that. However, even for the style, I wasn't too impressed with the taste and flavor. It is versatile and works with many meals. However, it isn't a good mouthfeel. The color is decent."
Worst,Kalik,2.88,"There is no date on the bottle. Right off the bat I have to admit that I do like this better than the stronger Kalik Gold, it's smoother. I don't see why so many people are complaining about this beer it's not that bad. I taste a good amount of malts, slight corn with a little bit of bitterness on the finish. I don't detect any corn syrup which is a plus but the aftertaste is not very pleasant. There is not a whole lot going on in the taste it's sort of bland, I prefer Carib Lager. I can't believe this beer has won awards, was it up against Bud Light & Corona Light? Cheers! C"
Worst,Kalik,3.03,"This OK lager does its job. A beverage suitable for tropical weather. Washes down average food. Crisp.
But, it has crummy-to-poor ratings. Why ?
Could it be because Heineken owns Commonwealth Brewery ? Or is it that raters want flavor and alcohol for under $2 ?
So, I try to figure out the ""Why"" of the low ratings and go on Heineken's website. And I was surprised to see how much they are updating their image. (Last time I looked on their site, it was several years ago when they funded the huge Lagunitas factory and brewpub in Chicago's ghetto.)
Amazingly, Heineken is following many themes of local crafters: sustainability, local sourcing, giving back to the community, reducing CO2, and lots of other good stuff. What can be bad if a big company is actually trying to do good ?
Regardless of the answer, I am glad to add the Bahamas to my list of countries."
Worst,Kalik,2.6,"12-oz. can BBD 07/18 needed a strong pour into a 16-oz. mug to get a fizzy very short-lived white head with no lacing.
Clear golden yellow with a few rising bubbles.
Smells of unattenuated yeast, corn and slightly sour malt.
Taste is the same as the smell with faint hops that are more pronunced as it warms.
Hidden carbonation gives the mouth feel a boost, slightly above thin.
Looks okay, the head comes back with a stern swish. Taste and smell are below average."
Worst,Kalik,2.17,"Look: Amber gold with very little white head.

Smell: Ugh, skunked bad. The skunkiness of light exposure in the perfectly clear and colorless bottle has completely ruined the beer.

Taste: The skunk is a little less pronounced in the taste. Other than that, just a bit of metallic bitterness and adjunct malt.

Mouthfeel: Thin and highly carbonated, like soda water.

Overall: Maybe a better container would improve this, but I have the feeling it would only be a typical adjunct lager. In these cheap clear bottles, the beer is ruined by the time it reaches your fridge."
Worst,Kalik,1.35,"I had this on draught in Nassau. It was urine yellow with a quickly fading head of foam. Smelled like wet grass clippings. the taste was overly sweet with absolutely no hops. The mouth feel was very watery and thin. Over all not horrible but not great either. If you happen to be in Nassau, New Providence Island and want something to quence your thirst then ask for a Kalik. I'd reach for one over Bud and other crap from AB."
Worst,Kalik,2.77,"Drink as cold as possible. In fact, feel free to add ice as this will not in any way detract from the flavour and may even improve it. +0.25 for being the only beer in the complimentary hotel mini-fridge. Overall: not utterly vile."
Worst,Kalik,2.6,"when you get down far enough south in florida, you start to find this one all over the place at every little beachside tiki around. its an extremely light offering, even in a style known for being extremely light, it barely even constitutes beer for me, with the grain profile so minimal here that its as much water or soda as it is beer, the lightest of yellow goldens and of perfect clarity. good soda fizz rising up to the next of the clear bottle each time i take a drag. its immediately a little metallic, but not all that bad, honestly the flavor isnt terrible, its just absent, if that makes sense. if had adjunct lagers taste far worse, but by being so minimal in every possible capacity here, this fails to really do much for me, and being a tad off of dry, it doesnt even quite quench my hard thirst as much as id like it to, especially after it warms up even a little bit. subtle lemon and lime here, yellow corn, and an irrelevant lager yeast that doesnt seem to have quite completed the task. its lightness and high carbonation set it apart, and it washes down some chilled shrimp pretty easily, but outside of an island vacation vibe, im not sure how much value this has, even amongst its peers..."
Worst,Kalik,1.26,"Why in the world did I pick up a 6er of this...Why?

This may quite possibly be the worst beer I have rated on this fine website. I picked this up being open minded and reminding myself I have found some gems I thought were turds along the way. Well, this ended up being a sad turd. The look was your classic piss-colored brew, though it did have a nice white head to start off with. The smell and taste were simply not good - no scent of hops or malt, just a skunky odor and taste that was miserable from start to finish. The feel was about the only thing notable as it had a spicy quality to it that was of surprise to me. Overall, I split the difference and I'm not wondering how in the heck I am ever gonna finish the other five I have."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,3.53,"Clear gold with two fingers of white head. Some rings of lace.
Smell is apple and grain.
Taste is sweet apple or pear juice. Some grain no apparent hops.
Mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation. Finish is dry and sweet.
Overall a big beer."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,3.51,"(24 fl. oz can, purchased cold... poured into a Goose Island chalice)

L: crystal-clear, brassy gold colored liquid; foam loudly sizzles away upon pour... looks like sparkling apple cider; no lace, no collar

S: initial aromatic pop includes sweetness/essence of pale malt leaping forward, backed quickly by what can only be described as spiced powdered donut or those Pfeffernüsse cookies... standard malt liquor smells, with only a mild extra kick of ethanol which, as it sits, later develops into an almost watery blended-Scotch and/or spiked used fryer oil scent... the raw booze does eventually take a lil precedence, but the malty wash in each sip snuffs out that sensation

T: malt flavor almost has a lightly-buttery, shortbread/sugar-cookie quality - - that hits first, but a torrent of spicy, sweetish booze charges past, leaving a light peppery note up front in the palate, while the now vaguely syrupy malt bounces back to the middle of the palate behind the wake of fire... not terribly sweet, either balanced enough by the strident booze and/or the carefully-crafted degree of grassy/herbal 'imported' hops added... the more one gets into it, the more it tastes like a malt-loaded, low-abv apple brandy

F: not too carbonated, not all that viscous, not much bite from the alcohol - rather dull on the palate, but it also doesn't quite feel like it's around 12%... I'd say champagne is more taxing to the senses... gotta get warmed up, but this is a walk in the park

O: really not all that bad considering, well, everything about it... my brother and I, during the initial stages of a day-long beer tasting hang-out, shared a half a can last week and we both agreed, while it wasn't terrible, it could be difficult (without training) to get through a whole 24 oz solo... best to drink this from the can and relatively cold... would not be opposed to buying this again if the situation, feeling, and company called for it - could pair well with some battered whiting and a sweet potato pie; a little greasy mound of collards and a knuckle of corn bread would pull it all together rather splendidly"
Worst,Camo Black Extra,4.64,"Goes down about as smooth as silk and it gets you right. Smells like a college basement party in northern wisconsin without a single cracked window in sight, so I suppose that means it smells like High Life or MGD coupled with sweaty baseball caps. I almost tasted alcohol on this one, and although other reviewers claim an apple taste, I'd like to claim a significant pear aftertaste. She's a good beer. The can says it uses imported hops as well, if that means something to you. Only reason she isn't a five is because she's about as flat as a red dog."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1,"This is not just the worst beer I've ever had, it is the worst beverage product period. Flavor pallet includes: Vick's cough syrup, rotten fruit, floor cleaner, and wood glue. This is the beer you buy to give to someone you absolutely despise, and its murderous hate you buy them 2."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.9,"Man this is some gnarly stuff. Aroma really wasn't too bad: fruit, caramel, spice, some corn. Flavor is super sweet and massive alcohol. Body is very heavy and finish was like the aftertaste of sucking on a sugar cube. Can't drink this."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.12,"I bought two of these (24oz cans for $1.99 each) and I knew they would be terrible but they were worse than i thought. The first one wasn't so bad but by the second one it was too much to handle, I ended up puking on the last drink of the last one just trying to force it down."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.05,"I once chewed up dried peyote buttons. Later in life, I sampled a special mineral water from Utah. Both these things tasted worse than anything I have ever put in my mouth. The peyote high was awesome though, after I threw up.

Camo Black is right up there with them. I poured it into a frosted glass, took a sip, and spit it out, then poured it down the drain. AVOID AVOID AVOID. It is TERRIBLE!"
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.84,"Alright so this isn’t going to be the typical beer review like me telling you the audience about the color, smell, and the amount of head. Instead I’m going to review this beer in the practical since because it’s a can of malt liquor.
The sound of the can cracking open is getting me excited. It sounds like someone taking a big bite out of an apple. I’m not going to bother smelling it because it’s MALT LIQUOR and it is meant to be slammed. So here we go. I chugged ¼ of the can before my gag reflex decided to come to work. Taste sweet as hell and also taste like Dynatabe mixed with whiskey. No hiding the alcohol taste in this shit. This shit is revolting, putrid. Alright got ½ the can before the gag reflex kicked in again and gave me the shivers with goose bumps, the taste took my breath away. The label should say CAMO BLACK EXTRA the malt liquor that fights back. They should have a guarantee of your money back if you can finish the can, I doubt very few can. Alright at this point with ½ of the can left it’s a battle of who is going to win me or the CAMO BLACK. I’ll tell you this I ain’t never poured out a beer before but with ½ of the can left staring me down, my body gets pissed off at me right now and wants me to give in. This shit kicked my ass. I killed the can but it took me 30min to do it in, I must be getting old. I sit and do the math, I realized I drank a 6 pack in the form of one can.
Alright overall the beer is good as a novelty at best. If you’re looking to get drunk then CAMO BLACK EXTRA is a guarantee. If you can suffer through the pain, this beer delivers one hell of a buzz, shit one more and I might be in black out mode. If 2 of these cans don’t get you f****d up than you need Jesus."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.5,"Camo Black Extra has a thin, white head, a deep, burnished orange-gold appearance, some bubble streams, and no lacing left behind. The aroma is not so strong, but a deep inhalation reveals cheap, store-brand, out-of-date caramel candy, wet grain husk, and other unidentifiable and unpleasant odors. Taste is of cheap, stale candy, overriding and highly unpleasant alcohol, and even a hop bite, if that can be believed. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a chalky under-taste. Camo Black Extra finishes highly boozy and terribly unpleasant. I poured it out. Bad stuff.

RJT"
Worst,Camo Black Extra,5,"There is no better description of the perfect beer than this. Very efficient, very cost effective, light on the calories for the punch it packs, and the perfect beer for drinking in a trailer park. If you complain about the ""burn"" of this, you probably should just quit drinking now. This is the perfect compliment to some good ol' McNaughton's Whiskey, Southern Comfort, or Wild Turkey. Wild Turkey chased with Camo always reminds me of this scene girl from back in the day who introduced me to Heaven's own blend of the two.
You really just don't get much better than Camo Extra Black. The hangover is probably the best part, it lasts all of about 15-30 minutes, and then you're set to go for the day. Two or three cans of this and a fifth of R&R and you're set for a night of graveyard partying, streaking, and just good old blacked out fun."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.78,"Seeing as how Camo Black Ice was just about the shittiest malt liquor to pass these lips, it was only fitting to try the ""Extra"" version to *truly* plumb the depths of the worst beers on the planet. For science. Here's to bad decisions...

Bright saturated orange color, rapid champagne carbonation, thin layer of white foam on the surface that does lace slightly. Audibly fizzy foam crackles like rice krispies.

Smells like artificial grape flavoring, energy drink, and Flintstones vitamins.

Tastes godawful. Very harshly astringent, vague paper and grape juice flavors, descending into utter malaise and ennui. Way overcarbonated and fizzy, rapidly fades into a numbing boozy aftertaste.

Even drinking this as cold as possible doesn't help mask the terrible taste. If you are just looking to get drunk, whiskey is a far better option.

Delightful story about Camo: http://goo.gl/uKrqxU

From the owner:
“It’s a unique category that appeals to college students and the ethnic market. It’s definitely skewed toward the male market.”"
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.78,"If I was a bum alcoholic, this would be perfect, sadly I'm not yet to that point yet, anyway. I picked this up at a local liquor store for $1.35, I wasn't expecting much, its a good thing I didn't get my hopes up, because this stuff is exactly what you pay for. At first i was thinking it wouldn't be too bad, it had a sweet apple kinda smell to it, the appearance was that of a normal lager, then.... I took a sip... I figured I should have braced myself, but not for anything like that. You can taste the alcohol as if its a boilermaker, however, it had kind of a sweet aftertaste that wasn't too bad, other than that for a lack of better words it tasted... ""Spoiled"" and pretty bitter. Drinking it too fast would make some of the most veteran drinkers cringe. Anyway, bottom line is, if your looking to get drunk, fast, and cheap, this is exactly what you need. For any other purpose, it doesn't really have one."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,3.21,"With ""imported hops and extra malted barley"", how could this not be good? Pours a clear golden color with a short lived golden head. The expected aromas of corn and sugar are there. Lots of apple and banana, but none of those imported hops. Tastes a bit sweet like coconut (maybe from rice?). Corn sugar and a little bit of bread flavor. Not bad, actually."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,4.39,"People really seem to hate THIS beer, but being on a fixed income, I LOVE CAMEO EXTRA BLACK!!! I will the admit the overall taste is, well yuck! I drink a 24oz can by pouring it into a pint glass, then SLAMING the whole glass down in one gulp!! I get two glasses per 24oz. can. And at $1.44 a can here in Portland, Oregon, it is ONE HELL OF A GOOD, CHEAP BUZZ ya all!"
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.91,"Special Reserve Camo Black Extra Ultra Premium High Gravity Lager Beer pours a typical lager yellow with no bells or whistles. A thin bubble ring resides around the rim of the pint. Aromas are moderately unpleasant. Sweet beer funk. This tastes like a weird concoction: PBR, Vodka, & sugar. There is a bad aftertaste of sweet alcohol with a residual thick liquid. At first six ounces there was some nice density, good bubbles, unfortunately masked by the bad taste. Last eighteen ounces no character develops, just the temperature. Overall this was mostly bad. It had some moderate attributes, but in the end taste is everything. I don't want to kill this beer because it is a beer, and if Buyability was a rating category this would be a 5. 24 FL OZ, 12.2 ABV, $1.59. As a beer advocate, I prefer this to an equally garbagy cheap ABV flavored E drink."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.21,"Had a tall can of Camo Black Extra (24 oz., 12.2% ALC)...

It does look decent upon pouring it in a tall glass, but upon a smell test it gives a rancid flavor.

The actual taste is quite an experience: I went from ""this is ok,"" to ""this is the worst 'malt liquor' I've ever had,"" in a matter of milliseconds, from the initial intake to the aftertaste. This brew is distinctively horrid. I'm down with Hurricane, I can do 211, but this is another level of putridness. The aftertaste is a mixture of rotting apricots and maggot-infested grapes of wrath...

The only reason to drink Camo Black Extra is budget and a very, very tight one. Even then, please save yourself the misery and buy a Four Loko or Joose."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,1.41,"24oz can and 12.2%abv, to me, makes for some hell on earth for me, me thinks.

It pours okay; brilliantly clear golden colour with a fast shrinking head of foam.

The smell is bordering on sickly sweet, like most of the style, with a strange aroma of grapes.

Palate invasion! It looks like a beer but is very grape forward. Some nasty sweet notes and alcohol follow after my initial shock towards the flavour of grapes. Lots of heat and more grapes is what follows and I can't take it any more. Down the drain you go."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,2.68,"CAN you dig an early start to the day? We debated this one on a snow day earlier in the year and the CANsensus is - Start when you're ready. I awoke early for some unknown reason following a night with a 2.5 L plastic bottle of Arsenaloye Strong beer and that should make a nice segue into this gem.

From the CAN: ""Special Reserve""; ""Imported Hops & Extra Malted Barley for an Extra Smooth Taste (& Flavor)""; ""Ultra Premium High Gravity Lager Beer""; ""Naturally Brewed Longer with the Highest Quality Extra Malted Barley"".

My initial reaction - Rubbish! The term ""Ultra"" CANjures up MKUltra, the ultra-secret use of LSD on unsuspecting Army GIs and ""Extra"" reminds me of my time in the PI. ""Mama-San, Suzie-Girl tells me there is an extra trick that she knows how to do."" ""Yes, but Extra is extra!""

The Crack & Glug produced two finger's of fizzy, bone-white head that disappeared like it could not wait to get away from whatever had produced it. In fact, it may have set a new record in terms of dissipation time. They may have ""naturally brewed"" this CANcoction, but it smelled as natural as plastic. The odor wafting off of it was of Concord grapes - vinous, but not in a good way and sweet as all get-out. My liver began its internal dance, hoping for the best against all odds. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was sizzling hot! OMFG, this was the equivalent of putting your tongue on the grill at the local Japanese steakhouse. Ssssszzzzlle. As the tears ran down my cheeks, a result of my weeping for those who are reduced to drinking this on a routine basis and for mine own dying liver, I girded myself for another sip. The initial heat behind me and my taste buds seared into submission, it reminded me of MD 20/20! No s**t! It was grapey as hell with a fusel alcohol burn known only to the most hardcore of us. I had a buddy in SoCal for whom that was his drink of choice and I sampled it in its various forms many times until I realized that even I could not hang. Wow, MD 20/20 as a beer!?! Who'da think it? Finish was bone-dry. It might have come off as sweet on the tongue, but from the back of my throat could be heard the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara. It was not unpleasant, actually. It might be attributable to the idea that my Brain Housing Group, not to be CANfused with the Trigger Housing Group, blew off in the first couple of sips, but I was starting to feel mighty mellow, dig? I was now beginning to search for the nearest brown paper bag so that I could join my neighbors in the alley. They are actually a good time, f'real, f'real. In the summer, I will jack up a bomber of some Rogue beer and hang wit' 'em but it's too chilly today. I would NEVER put this in my cooler, but it might make a nice gift to my bros in the alley and it definitely gets the job done. ""Works every time,"" says Billy Dee Wms. Nope, wrong beer, but this works too."
Worst,Camo Black Extra,2.38,"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by alcohol. Taste is, well the 12.2 abv is definatly present. After the initial alcohol burn there is a bit of sweetness to it. Really not much in the way of flavor. Feels light in the mouth with a slight alcohol burn and is not very drinkable. Overall unless you are looking to get wrecked cheap, this beer is best avoided."
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3.08,"I bought a can at the beer store in Ontario 473ml at 5%. Clear and good carbonation
Poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared but left a lace as you drink it.
Taste is light malty apple with a mild bitterness and skunky hop flavor.
It feels like it's watered down.
Overall it's light and easy to drink.
Average .
Cheers"
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.41,"Poured from the 473ml can into a tall pilsener glass. bubbly 1 inch head that diminished to a 1/4"" but remained for longer than I expected. Medium carbonation and attractive lacing for a few minutes after the pour. Smell is faint and inoffensive - the usual hints of grain. Emphasis on the first word in ""Pale Ale""; very little hop flavour up-front, although a bit of bitterness on the sides of the tongue and a mild hoppy bitter aftertaste at the back of the tongue. Tastes watered down, generally. As this is brewed by Sleeman's, it carries the same profile - not too varied, and drinkable. I'm sure this isn't a faithful imitation of the original Ale brewed in Scotland which won awards at the turn of the 20th century. But at $1.95 a can at the LCBO, it's certainly not without its merits."
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,1.51,"What utter crap masquerading behind a label with ""traditional pale ale"" and the association with Scotland. I won't even waste my time going through the indices in describing this concoction... Cheap swill. Period. Even Budweiser and Tsing Tao are a step above this shit!"
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.48,"Wanted to do a formal review of this one so revisiting. 473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. Purchased for $2 CDN.

Appearance - weak pale golden straw color. Decent finger of head was poured but doesn't last long. Some visible bubbles and the tiniest string of lacing left behind. Looks like a macro.

Smell- some grainy notes and a bit of a cooked vegetable wrapped around metal vibe as well. Smells like a macro.

Taste - very bland, I guess some coarse grainy flavor. Tastes like a macro, although probably a bit better than some.

Mouthfeel - it's wet and has a little less than average carbonation. Feels like a macro.

Overall - there's not too much good to say about this other than that it rates on par with macros, and as far as English pale ales go, it's pretty bad. I suppose there's a bit of bang for your buck here, but in this area, why not pay 10 cents more and get Spaten for an incredibly more satisfying brew?"
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,3,"Having sampled many Maclays Alloa Ales from the Thistle brewery in Alloa before it closed I was eager to sample some of the Canadian brewed efforts brewed under licence by Sleemans. I contacted Maclays (Now Maclay Inns) in Alloa and they sent me four cans. I have to say they are not anything like the Maclays Alloa brewed ales and more like a typical Canadian style beer.

Quite gassy, extremely pale and with some after taste. Not bad as an everyday budget range beer and is certainly drinkable but cannot compare with the original Maclays ales from the Thistle Brewery in Alloa (Scotland).

Certainly not the same as a traditional Scottish style IPA."
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.63,"Smallish white head slow recedes above a clear bright washed out golden colored beer.

Light sour grain malts aroma with a light soapiness to it.

Light grains come through in a lightly sour and lightly bitter tasting beer.

A light dry aftertaste without much taste to it with this light bodied beer.

Not to much going on with this beer, might find a home on a beerpong table if the price is right."
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.42,"473ml Can

Appearance - Clear yellow colour with a small size fizzy white head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing. There is some faint lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for only a few minutes before it was gone.

Smell - Bread/grains, corn syrup, malts, apples

Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and I can taste corn syrup, breads/grains and just a hint of malt. There is also an odd vegetable like taste to it. It ends with a grainy aftertaste with a bit of a spiciness.

Overall - There are much better options in the cheap beer category. This one had an odd taste to it that i couldn't put my finger on. I wouldn't buy this one again."
Worst,Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,2.5,"Tallboy can from the LCBO. Had it before, but not in a few years.

Pours a familiar golden-straw colour, with slightly more than a finger of pearl-white, fizzy head that is mostly gone within a few minutes. It's pale alright, but looks more like a lager to me. The aroma is grainy, with definite adjunct tones and some grassy hops.

Other than the fact that it is very mild, it has very little in common with legitimate EPAs. Grainy malts, with some corny/rice sweetness. Light apple juice fruitiness. Some weak, grassy hop notes toward the end. Clean finish without much aftertaste. Very watery and light-bodied, standard macro levels of carbonation but plenty drinkable.

When I was attending university (in Guelph, where Sleeman brands are popular - perhaps with logical reason because they always seem fresher there), I lived in a house with three friends and each of us would take turns buying 24s that we consumed collectively. Each of us had our favourite brands, and by the end of the semester, one side of the dining room was filled to the ceiling with cases of James Ready, Sleeman Honey Brown, Moosehead, and of course Maclays. We hauled the wall of bottles in and traded the deposit money for a couple more 24s of the same brands... and some Fosters, because we wanted to try something more exotic, I guess?

Maclays might technically be an ale, but they really shouldn't advertise it without putting an asterisk beside the word. For a buck-a-beer, it's reasonably good value though and if I were comparing this to other macros I'd have to give it at least a C+... but taken as an English-style pale ale, it's total garbage. If you are looking for comparables, think Lakeport."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.26,"Wouldn't normally go anywhere near this sort of beer , but a situation meant it was that or nothing else
I'm far more into quality over quantity these days , and as I was about to drive home , a non alcoholic decent ginger beer would be a far more satisfying choice
Tasteless in the extreme , I honestly don't see the point of drinking this ...truly awful"
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.27,"Asked for Australian beer on a Qantas flight and this was what they had. Clear golden color with white head. Light grain smell. Light feel with plenty of carbonation. Light malt flavor with a dry finish. Ok, but nothing to recommend it."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.98,"A clear, pale and lively golden yellow with a small, fading white head. Aromas of grass, grain and corn following onto the palate similarly. Light body and a watery mouthfeel, medium carbonation and a low-intensity, short length bitterness in the finish."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.24,"Had this early while watching hockey. Figured light would be best at 10am. From notes.

A - Poured golden, bright, one finger of fluffy white head. Good drapes of lace all the way down and a film of retention.

S - Light malt, sweet grain, dried leaves.

T - Dried leaves again, sweet grain. Quite grainy. Not overly good.

M - Quite dry in the finish with good carbonation, light body. Seemed really dry.

O/D - Unpleasantly dry. An odd beer. The dryness was funky and the flavours weren't pleasant. Wouldn't get it again. The alcohol doesn't exactly give you any bang for the buck either. Even though it's so light, it still has an unpleasantness."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.73,"On-tap at local on a driving night...

Usual one-finger head and no aromas due to serving temp.

Flavour was unusual tho. Not hoppy, but rather some sweet toffee-ish butterscotch flavours. Chalk and cheese to Cascade light.

Mouthfeel zippy and zingy....

Not bad actually."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.39,"Well I don't normally review these types of beers but here goes.

A - Pours a Golden colour with a thin white head that disappears real quick.

S - Nothing of note except some metalic aroma.

T - Urgh, fizzy water with nothing in the way of flavour.

M - Light and overcarbonated.

O - Avoid"
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.69,"Pours a pale golden colour with slow carbonation but quite a lot. Head is medium, resembling an old cobweb at parts, but retains for the most part. Lacing is a thick curtain, as per most Aus lagers.

Uneventful nose, a bit sweet like it has traces of rice in there, slightly metallic hop. All very weak. Unimpressed indeed.

Taste is similarly weak. Mostly watery with a slight sweetish buttery taste. Aftertaste is very metallic and chemical, with a sharp chemical hang, but again nothing too strong. Yes I know this is a light beer. That just makes it piss weak and flat. If taste were there though it would be horrible. Nothing to recommend."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.33,"Golden pour, small head that quickly fades to nothing.
Aroma is very tame, with some cereal and a very faint hint of hops, and some skunk.
Sweet sugary malt and corn makes up the taste. Very low bitterness.
Light mouthfeel with huge carbonation.
Boring, but does a good job at being inoffensive."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.46,"Look.... had this having no choice really... was driving, had already knocked back a couple of decent beers, so took a draught middy this.

I'm not going to analyse it any great depth... it's a light beer. But I will just mention a strange sense I was drinking a mild. For a moment, if I closed my eyes, I detected some richer malt notes that would have tricked me into thinking the beer was darker than it was.

Strange.... maybe some very pale crystal in there to give this effect.

Still not a beer I recommend."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.24,"Don't ask me why I have a bottle of this. I think I grabbed it from a free event because I figured I'd never reviewed it, and I wasn't going to fork out my own cash on it... Anyway, here we go...

Pours a clear golden colour. Lots of carbonation. REasonable fluffy white head. Look alright, all things said and done.

Absolutely nothing on the nose whatsoever. Water has more smell than this (I mean, at least Sydney water has that chlorine character to it...). Hmm. No, alright, there's a (very slight) grainy or vegetative arome, but this is very, very faint.

Taste is inoffensive, slightly metallic and very thin. Not much to it, but you'd be hard pressed to call it ""unpleasant"".

It's bland, no two ways about it. But it's not undrinkable. I've had much worse beers than this - beers that you can't finish, or want to tip down the sink. While this ""beer"" is insulting to the true breweries out there, it's not something that's truly unpleasant."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.63,"Appearance - 2.5
Poured only half a finger of white head, even after a reasonably hard pour, but it remained at a thin layer for quite a while. Looks highly carbonated, the colour is a clear bronzy yellow, not unlike that of their full-strength lager.

Smell - 2.0
No skunk, so it must be pretty fresh, considering the clear bottle. A rather weak smell which doesn't strengthen with warming, but there is some malt sweetness and grains.

Taste - 2.5
For a light beer, this is really not too bad; it's refreshing and doesn't have any real nasty flavours. Truthfully, it doesn't really have much flavour at all, there is a whisper of sweetness, cheap white bread, grains, slightly metallic and a very slight bitter hop presence in the dry finish. Slight sour aftertaste with no real flavour.

Mouthfeel - 3.0
Moderate to highly carbonated, feels light in the mouth, but not quite watery. Pretty thin, but that is expected for the style.

Drinkability - 3.5
Definitely scores points for the low alcohol, but anyone who wants flavour will be bored in no time.

OVERALL - 2.55
For its style, this beer stands up pretty well. Overall it's not a great brew, but I would usually choose it over a soft drink, so it cannot be that bad. Inoffensive, refreshing and sessionable for those who don't mind the lack of flavour. It's also cheap which is a plus, but just a little more money and you can start to get some truly decent beers, which would always be my preference."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.76,"Pours a light golden color with lots of white chunky head that seems to stick around for a while. Not much in the way of aroma. Very faint yeast smell. Not a whole lot of flavor, some sweetness and a little chemical bitterness, and a lingering nasty metallic taste on the backend. Might be the aluminum can, but I've had other cans without that taste. Mouthfeel is very watery with a slight rasp from the carbonation. All in all, a below average beer. For an aussie macro, still below average."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.52,"Whilst it appears inviting being clear light gold with an enthusiastic bead and head, things deteriorate somewhat dramatically.
There is a toilet soap dispenser smell , that thankfully isnt carried through to the taste. instead there is surprisingly little.I should have scored them a little more for taste as there must be a skill in extracting all the flavour from whatever the tip into the container to make this.
It is sort of like drinking fizzy water from a public convenience.
The only saving grace is that it doesnt come from Victoria"
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,1.83,"beer started foaming up as soon as the bottle was opened! didnt expect that.
pours a typical golden color with a nice sized white head. however, it left that sickly melted-marshmallow looking stuff on the side of the glass as the level dropped.
again, typical sort of candy like sweet aroma.
taste, at first, isnt all that bad. it has some kind of metallic quality to it that just gets more and more off-putting as it warmed. pretty odd since its out of a bottle.
mouthfeel is crisp while still cold, but goes downhill from there.
keep it in the boottle, keep it cold."
Worst,Hahn Premium Light,2.07,"decent, but only just. It pours an ice cream cone looking head, which can be used as a joke towards the designated drinker of the night. their drinking light so they have to expect a bit of ribbing. There's no real taste to the beer, it's a macrobeer, what do you expect."
Worst,Old Style Light,2.54,"Poured from a cab into a plastic cup. Pours golden straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of corn and cereal grain, underwhelming. Tastes of watery grain, no hops of any sort. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a below average beer."
Worst,Old Style Light,3.26,"L- Just to as close to water as possible. Lots of carbonation, one-finger bubbly white head.
S- Sweet grain smell.
T- Suprisingly good. I will drink Old Style especially at Wrigley. It does have some good grain and malt taste, especially for a light. Way better than Bud, Coors and others.
F- Crisp, light and refreshing like it is supposed to be.
O- As good as macro gets. I will drink this, Pabst and Moosehead."
Worst,Old Style Light,4,"Old Style Light | Pabst Brewing Company. Poured from the can into a pint glass, this brew's head is two fingers thick, with spotty lacing, and a rather pale light golden clear body.

Smells like corn with a touch of other full-bodied grains.

Lighter on the corm/malt than others, but still enjoyable nonetheless. At least it actually has a flavor to it.

The mouthfeel is medium-light with mild carbonation.

I'll give Old Style Light an overall rating with a solid 4. I could chill on these on a nice hot day."
Worst,Old Style Light,4.18,"Old Style Light brewed by Pabst Brewing Company, with an ABV of 3.80% This brew pours out a golden amber color with a small white head. There is a nice amount of carbonation to this light brew. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass nice. The smell of Old Style Light is rich with grains and malts. Lots of corn and other malts in the smell. You pick up a hint of hops in the smell of this brew. This light brew has the look and smell of most light brews on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, light and crisp with grains and malts. For the style this brew is pretty decent. Not the best but it is smooth. I like how smooth this brew goes down. There is nothing overpowering about this light brew, Old Style Light has an decent balance to it. The mouth feel of Old Style Light is Light, crisp, clean, smooth,and refreshing. Overall I'm giving Old Style Light a 4.25 out of 5. Not a bad drinking brew, it would go down good on a hot summer day. I would buy this brew again. Pabst Brewing Company, did a nice job with this light brew."
Worst,Old Style Light,2.28,"Painfully average, but heavier a light beer than I expected. I thoroughly enjoy Old Style, despite a lot of the divided and often negative opinions it merits (my father cites it and Miller High Life as the two worst beers he has ever had), and this light alternative is almost the same in terms of matching how filling its brother beer is. Other than that, it brings a middling taste to the table, but after Miller 64, everything seems so exquisite in flavor."
Worst,Old Style Light,3,"Left the night shift early to hit the casino with a coworker. He had a case of Old Style Light in his backseat. We shotgunned a few of them in the parking lot each. I then walked in like I owned the place, put $100 down on red, and lost. After we each lost a little more money, we laughed about the whole thing over some more Old Style Lights and an illegal cigarette.

Overall: Old Style Light isn't Weihenstephaner Original, but it's now the traditional casino beer."
Worst,Old Style Light,2.28,"I have maintained the original is not absolutely terrible. But with the lightening of the beer somehow the corn adjunct is more painful, and the grains are now more noticeable in the taste. But for a light macro, this strangely does have a decent malt present while being fizzy and watery. Pass on this"

T: Malty and medium sweet, caramel malt, very little hop, hint of skunk at times.
F: Highly carbonated, has a crisp bite, light body, bite may be a little harsh at times.

GLASSWARE: Penn State pilsner... pours the picture-perfect image of an adjunct lager: shiny golden, lively with small bubbles, with a thick, fluffy head akin to a mountain top.... the metallic ping of the macro lager is apparent and sharp, with crackling toasted oats, hay, and some light flowers... otherwise, rather passive in its presence.... refreshing, lithesome in its weight, swift in its movement with a light lagerish finish in the throat... soft and sweet--water in essence--with a subtle hint of garden hose, this doesn't move the needle much... I can cross this off the list of the unreviewed, but in the midst of Oktoberfest time, this presents a sad departure from taste, craft and quality..."
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.81,"Look: Clear gold. One finger of fizzy white head with low retention.

Smell: Unusual sweetness with moldy cardboard.

Taste: Bready malt, sweet corn.

Mouthfeel: Average, with mild carbonation.

Overall: Bland."
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.86,"Taj Mahal is a crystal clear, pale amber colored lager. Thin streams of CO2 support pe

Taj Mahal's aroma starts off sweet, a combination of refined sugar and ripe, sweet corn. Up front sweetness is supported by soda cracker and lightly toasted cereal grains. Aromas of corn adjunct sweetness persist throughout the aroma. The finish is crisp and clean.

On the tongue, Taj Mahal is light bodied and fairly smooth and crisp. Taj Mahal tastes like pale malts and toasted cereal grains with hints of adjunct sweetness which contrast the cereal grains without actually adding anything to the proceedings. Center is slightly rounded and refreshing with the finish being dry and lasting.

Taj Mahal's chief flaw is that is simply tastes like every other mainstream adjunct lager on the market. It's kind of forgettable in that way, sadly."
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.44,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention fading over time to leave a tiny bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a grainy smell mixed with some aromas of cracker malt and a touch of grass.
Taste – The taste begins with a cracker malt taste with a touch of caramel and some light grainy flavors. These flavors constitute the base flavor of the brew and last throughout. Toward the end of the taste a little bit of grass and some hay come to the tongue, leaving one with a rather crisp lager taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is rather high. For the style the feel is good and makes for an easy drinker.
Overall – An alright lager overall. Crisp, clean, and decently flavorful."
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,1.84,Pours a straw color with a white head. Medium carbonation. Malty hops aroma which seemed reasonable. The taste was very light and I didn’t think it was flavorful....I’ll pass on this one unless it’s the only option on the menu.
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.37,"Solid beer. Very underrated as most Indian beers are. If you are looking for a classic beer to have with spicy food or sitting around the grill, this is a good choice. I can only find it in 22 ounce bottles here in the states but it is always one to pick up when I see it."
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,3.36,"(330 ml brown bottle, MFD 01/19, batch no 682; purchased cold single at Shangy's... poured into a fat tulip)

L: polished-clear, pale gold liquid; crackly white foam sponge... keeps and tight. bubbly collar and, surprisingly, leaves some webby lace

S: stale apple-cinnamon, pils malt and toasty adjunct... lightly-toasted corn syrup

T: mild flavors, more corny than malty... sort of a mellow malt liquor on par with say a Colt 45, but a couple notches less buttery depth... weak peppery spice, weak toasty corn syrup

F: bit of prickle up front; expansive carb burst upon first sip; whisper-quiet, almost over-attenuated, bone-dry finish (its dominant pro)

O: maybe an appreciated reminder of the home country for some, hardly flawed, but this is an otherwise pointless import (1616)"
Worst,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,2.41,"A little tough to drink - bottled in February, lots of residual skunkiness that made it fairly unpalatable. Clear golden color with scant head and no lingering lacing. Smells skunky, a little malt and grain and sweet corn in the background. Tastes similarly. Too sweet and artificial tasting for me. Thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Maybe a fresher bottle at a restaurant would have been better?"
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,3.68,"Smells like unripe feijoas!

Nice lager! Smooth drop so don't drink it fast because it will put you on your ass!

Although nice semi warm it's a dream if nicely chilled but do try it for yourself.

If you like TSINGTAO you will convert.

If you can tolerate KINGFISHER then I think you'd like the taste of this beauty."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.66,"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of green apples, grains, not a good sign.

Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.75,"I had this beer while travelling in China on business in April 2015. Likely to never get there again, so I decided to try as many different China brewed beers as I could. This was 1 of 6 beers I tried in my travels and in doing my research before departing the states this was considered a Top 10 China (Euro Lager) beer! The ABV was 5.3 according to my language assistant. I poured from a clear glass, 600ml bottle after purchasing at a restaurant; quite a different look from the picture depicted.
A - mellow yellow, with very slight head and almost no carbination
S - grainy, mild to the nose
T - watery and bland with some sweetness
F - light, no lacing and thin

If you must have a beer while in China, then give it a go - but it is not much to write home about!"
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.47,"Format: a 330mL dark green bottle with a pretty ordinary macro label. Looks... suspicious.

Appearance: pours out a fairly thin-looking light yellow with okay carbonation. A fizzing white head drops from a finger almost immediately. Doesn't look great.

Aroma: there is a touch of cereal grain there, but much more adjuncts - particularly rice. Smells cheap if not offensive.

Taste: I don't mind some Asian adjunct beers - some actually make the rice taste quite nice. This is not one of those beers. An awkward fug from the rice, and only cheap and light cereals to back it up.

Aftertaste: more rice awkwardness on the finish. Not a great beer.

Mouth feel: light in body to the point of being somewhat watery, with a moderate to higher carbonation.

Overall: a fairly cheap lager at AU$38 a case, but there are better quality beers even at this level. I'd rather spend a few bucks more and get some VB."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.26,"Drank it directly from an ice cold can (that's how you drink macro lager). 4.3% ABV.

Typical adjunct with very minor skunky taste. Poor malt presence, plenty of rice though.

Good to go with Chinese food. Especially crayfish stirfried with szechuan peppercorn."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,3,"Touch of grain, some bit of skunk, definitely more ""beery"" than the weaker Pearl River beers, with some extra bitterness that's not entirely metallic. Quaffable, cheap."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.67,"330ml Can from Yue Hwa, Chinatown, Singapore (SGD$ 2.30):
Light, golden straw that is clear and thin with a bubbly white head on top that sets as a patchy lacing that barely covers half of the surface area.

Sweet with water and light, grassy hops making up most of the rest. There are a few adjuncts but that's about it and it is very light.

Water with a hint of sweetness and the faintest of grassy hops on top. There is a bit of biterness but not much else to speak of other than a hint of citrus towards the end.

Thin and light with medium carbonation and a strange, semi-sweet feel with a hint of skunk and bitterness.

A very poor beer and up there with some of the worst I have tried although by no means the very worst. The beer was cheap and thin with little in the way of taste or smell."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,3,"A rather unremarkable Chinese beer. When poured a very light pale gold coloured beer; a small white head. Good carbonation. A strong aroma of rice is present, but on tasting this is a weak bland beer, water like is one of the first things that come to mind. At the same time, it didn't put me off (like other Chinese beer)."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.25,"Pours crystal-clear golden body without visible effervescence topped by half an
inch thin non-lasting white head.

Sweetish malt aroma with noticeable yeast character reminiscent of green apples.

Medium-light bodied, crispy and dry on the palate, slightly malty with green apple like fruitiness and slight carbonic acid bite. Bland with no hop flavor/aroma to speak of. (330 ml without BB indication, into tulip.)

Chinese should stick to what they make best - food - and leave brewing to others."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.17,"330 ml green glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Disneyland thimble glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are rather low.

Served refrigerator cold. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.

A: Pours a one finger head of no real cream, white colour, okay thickness, and average retention. Colour is a clear dark yellow. No visible yeast particles. No bubble show.

Sm: Cream and barley. A mild strength aroma. Not particularly appealing, but not repugnant.

T: Cream over a clean barley body. Very simple, boring, and bland. There's very little to say about it. Not layered, complex, or subtle. Very dull.

Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours of the body generally. Weak. Too thin. Carbonation is adequate but not ideal.

Dr: Drinkable in that its ABV is average and no flavours are particularly bad. But it's so damned boring. I won't get this again, nor would I recommend it - even for the price.

Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.5,"As with most things made in China, this is a very bland and ordinary beer. It is flat and watery and there is way too much carbonation for my liking. The beer pours a very watery yellowish color, with an excess amount of head. The beer barely has a taste. It tastes more like a light beer out of a can. This is a very bad beer."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.37,"This is a direct import from China, and my can is greater than or equal to 4.3% alc/vol. Ingredients: Water, High Quality Malt, High Quality Rice, Hops...

A- Comes in a cool can that has the pull off tab and members of the Chinese National Basketball team, with Yao Ming as the focal point. The brew itself is urine yellow in color, with very minimal head...what there is quickly vanishes into nothingness. This is very highly carbonated and resembles pop..providing a carbonated ring around the glass at the top of the brew. There is also no lacing to speak of but instead an oily looking film covering my glass. Not very impressive to look at!

S- Typical Chinese lager aromas, being very similar to BMC type beer. Sweet malt/rice adjuncts dominate...it smells very similar to a piece of fermented rice cake dessert that I tried recently...not super appealing to be honest. I don't smell any of the hops that are said to be used in this either.

T- Well it tastes better than it smells, but not by much...it follows fairly close to the aroma. Again, there is sweet malt and/or rice, which actually keeps it clean tasting. The flavors are light overall and have a typically synthetic character about them. There is little to no hop presence either.

M- Thin and watery, which isn't unexpected...afterall, this is brewed for the Asian population and I think for the climate it's intended for, it works. It's very carbonated and scrubs the palate accordingly.

O- It's a very forgettable Chinese lager, and it's not one of the better ones. However, I would drink this again if necessary, as it's not offensive or anything, and makes a nice hot weather adult beverage if you just want something simple....I wouldn't purchase it though if I have a choice..."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.32,"Pours a pale gold colour, head is white and bubbly, disappears very quickly. Stream of big carbonation bubbles don't revive it. Not very interesting.

Smells carbolic and...meh. Sweet grain with rice and a sour acidic 'beer' aroma. Maybe hints of bittering hops, mildly metallic. Inoffensive but very generic.

Taste is sweet upfront with weak rice notes and hints of corn syrup. Develops mild cereal grain note with pearl barley on mid-palate. Bit residually sweet on the back, with nowhere near enough bitterness, just sweet and grainy, and overall very bland.

Fizzy feel but gently so, it needs fizz to cut through the sweetness but not enough, not a great job.

Meh."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.67,"330ml bottle poured into a 16oz pint glass.

A - Fizzy white, one finger head. Fizzles out fast. Looks like apple juice. By the end of the review, I can honestly say that this is the worst looking beer I've ever seen. No carbonation left at all, seriously just looks like juice.

S - Rice and something really metallic. Really odd...

T - Some extremely light malt and rice. Really, really watery. Almost nothing going on here. Not even some infamous green-bottle-skunk. Not offensive, but not really anything...

M - Low carbonation and watery, thin mouthfeel.

D - Really not all that enjoyable. Seriously lacking in the flavor department."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.43,"When in Rome, or in this case a Chinese restaurant.
Looked OK to start but the white fizzy head disapated almost instantly, leaving a dark straw coloured beverage. Probably should have left it in the bottle than poured into the 1984 Calgary Olympic tulip glass.
Smells like a lager but with perhaps a bit more of some honey and grassy notes.
The taste was somewhat sweet and had very little else to offer.
The mouthfeel was flat and has a semi dry short finish. Had this not been cold and with a meal I most likely would not have finished it. The glass may have helped class this beer up a notch."

I won't be picking it up again but I didn't dump it down the sink either"
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.14,"Chilled 330ml bottle poured into a tall pilsner glass.

Very pale body with straw chardonnay-like gold hue. Pushes up a big effervescent and lively bulk of head that falls away all to quickly.

Aromatically this is rather boring with only the stereo typical run of the mill lager hops, yeast and malt notes.

As with the aroma, taste is very bland and almost a perfect imitation of the mass produced corona like lagers.

Where this beer works is its ease of consumption, its light body, clean after taste and its crisp refreshing mouthfeel - its a winner.

On a hot afternoon and/or evening you will be very happy with two or three of these. Likewise, a perfect accompaniment with a sizzling Tieban of szechuan or chili beef

I originally stopped in at my usual beer merchant to pick up Tsingtao (a personal favorite) to have with that evenings hot and spicy meal. When I learnt that Tsingtao was all out I was offered this is a replacement. Can't say this is worthy of replacing Tsingtao but still good all the same.

The best score for this one is drinkability."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,3.01,"Appearnce: Highly carbonated, lots of bubbles, medium sized head, gold colour

Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,2.33,"Pale lager yellow with a large bone white head that receeded to a thin cap & ring. All in all an average looking lager.

Very faint graininess and not much else comes to my nose here. Certainly lacking any spicy/floral hop that one would associate with a Euro Lager.

Watery is the first thing that comes to mind here. Some faint grainy-sweet malt and a touch of hop bitterness. Some mineral water taste from the 'Pearl River' perhaps is also present. Finishes quite dry, almost turning citric acid like minutes after tasting.

There are better Asian beers out there my friends."
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.59,"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color lager with a medium foamy head with good retention and good lacing.

Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,3.21,"Appearance
Clear, straw yellow; nice, substantial and quick-to-rise white head; head subsides quickly, leaving no lacing

Aroma
Familiar, skunky lager aroma, similar to Heinekin or Corona; nothing too appetizing

Taste & Mouth Feel
Very light, crisp, and clean; surprisingly good! No nasty aftertaste  very clean-cut; light mouth feel, good, high level of carbonation; pleasant bready/malty/yeasty taste

Comparisons
Its very similar and on par with the other H.K. beer I tried, Kingway; theyre both very refreshing and clean; aromas not great, but the flavor makes up

Overall
Great for a hot afternoon; one of the better cheap lagers Ive had; Im doubly impressed with Hong Kongs offerings as I liked the other one quite a bit for the style"
Worst,Pearl River Lager Beer,1.56,"Consumed in mass on a fishing trip off Hainan Island in the South China Sea.

Appearance: Ultra pale almost white yellow, moderate carbonation, minimal white head.

Aroma: Light malts, rice, corn, grass.

Taste: Sweet loads of corn or rice. Grassy and some grainy hops.

Mouthfeel: Thin, watery, sweet, dirty.

Drinkability: Low. If I wasnt stranded on some secret island, at some secret military base, unable to leave the dock and with nothing to do but catch scorpion fish and drink this beer until the guards returned with some German Shepard that our boat had been Shanghaied by the Red Army to transport, Im not sure that I would have cared for this beer all that much. Considering the circumstances I was drinking this under, Im still not sure I liked it very much."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.41,Tastes better than most adjuncts. Has some fruity hop flavors and lots of corn which tastes pretty good. This plus weed smoke transports me back to high school since everyone's dad drank it so that's what we had. Worth the price in my opinion.
Worst,Labatt Blue,5,"Ah, yes.. the beer snobs are at it again. Start ranking beers for what they are, not what you want them to be or what you would like to be drinking. Ffs. Ridiculous."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.25,Poured from a stovepipe into a pint glass; no birth date. Pours fizzy piss yellow with no head but plenty of carbonation. Tastes of sweet corn adjunct with no real backing to tame. Meh.
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.53,"Had this one at one of my local Farmer's Market outings. It was hot as hell and they were selling them at $2.00 a can. Brought back memories of drinking these in the past. Used to like this beer way back when but as I've grown older so has my taste in beers that are fuller and with higher ABVs.
Definitely not as good as I remember. If offered, I would not turn it down but I would not seek it out."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.63,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds. This one is pretty decent - no offensive smells or flavors. A light-bodied, easy-drinking bready malt I would be happy to revisit."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.16,"Nothing jumped out at me but the straw of the barley taste, the corn and other adjuncts made it taste like how I think Canada's beer tastes. I see this as another Molson, but I do like it. It is just not a beer I would get again, nor would I turn it down at a party. I liked the flavor of the water, I liked the malt but there is something about it that is just not my style. I would hate only to overall this a 3/5 But I see others rating it 63/100 so I would agree."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.47,It’s one of my go to beers at the grocery store. A 6pack is cheaper than American beer at Publix. Try it with a little real ginger ale for a ginger beer.
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.77,"Good ol Labatt Blue, the Bud of the Canadian market. In University I always remember folks considering Labatt and Molson the typical Canadian macro, and Moosehead was ‘the good stuff’.

Pours a classic light yellow straw colour. Fizzy finger and a half head foams and dissipates as fast as it arrives.

Sweet aroma on the nose, corn and sweet wheaty notes. A little bit of generic cereal grains. Mild and inoffensive.

Taste follows closely to what you smell. Recommended, like many macros, to drink ice cold. The sweetness opens up as it warms to the point of stickiness, like when you get a mouthful of mushy alphabits cereal or rice krispies that have been sitting in a bowl of sugared milk for an hour. Slight bitterness that has a slight metallic flavour to it, but still retains a slight edge of grassiness of the hops.

Light bodied with medium carbonation, very crisp mouthfeel, not a very long finish, finishes fairly bland with a slight graininess.

As I say for most of the macros I revisit, it’s not worth just buying something else at the same cost or an extra quarter per beer to get an explosively better experience. Especially in Canada where our alcohol prices are terrible, it is absolutely not hard to find another macro or even plenty of cheaper microbrews and craft. Most of the high ratings have to do with nostalgia, which is a powerful motivator of course. Nothing wrong with that. But for a beer many describe as ‘that easy drinking workhorse/good for mowing lawns/etc’, there is absolutely no doubt you can find better for the same price.

That being said, if you like Labatt, then go for it. It’s not my thing anymore, but if you like it, that’s what BA is for. Ranking beers on your own preference. You don’t gotta try to justify it based on anything else than the fact you enjoy the taste yourself."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.25,"Finally got up north enough to grab a 12 pack of cans. Haven't had this in years/decades
pours out a typical light straw gold, but more color than i expected. Fizzy one inch white head dies down pretty fast.
Smells - it's basically a light sweetness, like a hint of sweet corn. Not awful, but very basic.
Taste is light, sweet ,basic and pretty decent. Clean enough finish .
Overall, it's pretty much a cereal/corn flake type of taste that can be slammed easily and enjoyable with cheap food."
Worst,Labatt Blue,4,"This is a good basic beer. I'm a working man. I don't have a budget for a lot of craft beers. I buy this regularly and it satisfies me the way my old Ford Escape gets me where I want to go even in a foot of snow. Sorry to be basic. Feel a little out of place here. But if you can't afford steak, there's nothing like a good hamburger."
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.83,"Pours a typical pale straw. Eggshell white head comes on all frothy and then pulls a vanishing act. Tiny little bubbles lazily float towards the top of the glass. It doesn't look terribly appealing but it looks the part of an adjunct lager and so you can't rate it too harshly. Smells like lightly sweetened cereal and not much else. Alphabits without the marshmallows? Maybe a little grassy if I dig deep. Tastes, you know, pretty much like it smells with a mild bitter hop bite. It's not especially tasty, but it's far from offensive. *shrug* Very crispy up front, though it does mellow a bit on the finish. Yeah; not much to say. This is perfectly drinkable swill that reminds me of my youth. Hard to believe I used to think this stuff was objectively good."
Worst,Labatt Blue,5,This the beer you can get in a keg. Take that bad boy to your cabin up north and put it into the garage. You and your friends can easily kill in one night. Best beer jands down
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.7,"I'm gunna go ahead and purger myself here and say, I love this beer. The only real downside to me is they can charge more for it not being domestic. If I was Canadian, I would fight Molson fans over this. This beer is like the winner of basic go to of Canadian beers. Put this up to a bud and I will take it 5 times outta 5. Deport me now I'll gladly go. You can taste the hops. It has weight. It doesn't come over as watery or cheap. It also isn't a hipster ipa level bitter. Bitter should be a slight part of a beers flavor profile, not the whole thing. This beer does it. If they refined it a bit to get it outta that value level flavor it would be a killer. I like it and I'm not ashamed"
Worst,Labatt Blue,5,"Guys, this was a 70s beer - back when it was a canadian owned company - the stuff you drank while you were driving around with your highschool buddies, smoking weed, listening to Led Zep with the windows rolled down on a Sat night in the dead of an upstate NY winter - so about zero degrees far or colder. the beer was cold and crisp - kinda like your face - you were basically numb so taste didn't really enter into it and who really gave a Fk? one thing you noticed, when the car skidded to a halt on the snow covered asphalt and you stumbled out to take a p*ss, the color of the beer matched the color of your stream - if that ain't poetry i don't know what is? Fkn A."
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.68,"This time it came from a tap into a clear pint glass. Light amber colored and bright, but very translucent. A reasonable head and glass lacing accompany the visual. It's an adjunct lager and a Pilsner at that, so the lack of aroma is expected, not disappointing. What is disappointing is that it provides a hint of a good Pilsner up front, but the finish is pretty bad. There's absolutely no sharp, dry and clean finish, as a good Pilsner will have. Instead, it's blandly malty and characterless, with a little unwelcomed yeastiness. In Pennsylvania, we don't need beers like this to travel hundreds of miles to get here. We've got local mediocre beers aplenty."
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.87,"Solid shitbeer. Yes this qualifies as a shitbeer in my opinion. Though the flavor isn't bad it's just nothing special. A bit watery but still serves a solid beer taste. I could see this coming in handy at a party. Very easy to chug, the carbonation is not overwhelming like other shitbeers. Wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't complain if it was my only choice."
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.68,"First off, aggressive pour, little to no head retention. Looks like Wal-Mart apple juice. Smells like almost nothing. I work at an asphalt plant, so that may just be me. Taste? Slightly sweet (ish) carbonated water, absolutely NOTHING off- putting about this pilsner, better from the bottle straight out of the cooler, or fridge, than a glass or mug, IMHO. Good carbonation, mouthfeel is nice and crisp. ULTRA refreshing, especially when cold. This is a great fishing/ beach/ mowing/ whatever the hell you do on the weekend beer, especially at just 4.7% ABV. Not bad, but I prefer beer with more flavor...and more alcohol.... It will definitely fill you up before you get tanked, that's for sure. Overall, a solid weekender when you actually have to get shit done."
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.02,"I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario 473ml at 5%.
poured a 2finger head into glass that left a lace as you drink it.
slow carbonation with very little bitterness.
very easy drinking average beer .
cheers"
Worst,Labatt Blue,3.37,"This pours a golden hue with a good amount of carbonation and a decent head that sticks around for a while.

The aroma is slightly bread like but sweetness mostly dominates here.

Taste-wise at first it seems slightly more robust than your average American Lager however there is still that sweetness in the finish. Also a bit of grain is present. It finishes pretty smooth with very little bitterness.

All in all this isn't a bad beer whatsoever. It is easily drinkable but there are still better examples of this style from the American side of the border."
Worst,Labatt Blue,2.75,"11.5 oz Bottle - Twist Off - Unknown Freshness Date

A: Pours bright golden yellow. Clear. Strong visible carbonation. Two fingers of bone white head. Above average retention with some nice lacing. Looks good for the style.

S: Malty and grainy. Very light floral aroma. Sweet. bread.

T/M: Light bodied and crisp. Strong carbonation. Dry feel. Aftertaste is malty and dry. Light floral flavors are noticeable. Mostly cereal and malt grains. Crackers and yeast.

O: Not bad for the style. Good look and has a better taste than most adjunct lagers. Still weak and grainy with little hop flavors.

Cheers!"
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.25,"This one's a real high school memory beer. Back in the day this was one of our favorite beers. It was cheap and we could always get it, and it was good. Still not too bad but you definitely want to drink it ice cold. Enjoy!!"
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.87,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into my pils glass.

On the pour a light 2 finger fine head forms, then over the course of a couple minutes it dissipates to a ring around the glass. The body is a light golden straw with relatively lazy carbonation for the style. No lacing.

Aroma is quite malty with some nice crackery notes, and the yeast is also quite detectable but in a slightly estery generically beery sort of way. Everything smells very light. There is a slight hint of grassy herbal hops. For the style this isn't half bad. As the beer warms diacetyl does become noticable.

Flavor is quite similar to the aroma but with some detectable adjunct sweetness. Hop bitterness is present but vague and the malt is quite sweet. Again once the beer warms diacetyl is present, keep this one cold and probably don't pour it into a pils glass.

Feel is crisp with a high carbonation bite and a nice foamy head to make the beer feel softer. This is a very cheap beer and for the price it could be a whole lot worse, it's pretty dang drinkable.

Overall this is a cheap full flavor lager that isn't terrible with a nice malty character. There is some off but as long as it stays cold it's a pretty good budget option."
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.86,"They said Ohtani couldn’t do it in the Manor Leagues. They said Orson Welles couldn’t eat 30 hot dogs in one sitting from Pinks. They said Nicola Tesla was a quack… And they said Raul wouldn’t like Genesee. But not only does Raul, he Genesee’s through all the haters.

Get some.

Ok, maybe Genesee is now sliding… All of a sudden the word “Play Doh” seems appropriate…"
Worst,Genesee Beer,1.09,"In any category, this watery corned water is probably the lamest beer I've ever had in 40 plus years of drinking beer.
head is gone instantly, no aromas, very little cornish hint of flavor, no hops noticed. Flat as a fart in under five minutes.
I expected it to be a mainstream cheap crap lager, and it was worse than I expected."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.75,"Poured from a 16 oz can purchased at 802 store in Arlington, VT. Pours light yellow with very light head. Stale, adjunct corn taste with slight carbonation. For what it is, it's not terrible. Decent garage beer."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.6,"The beer of my youth. I was weaned on Genny’s nipple.
Best beer EVER!
But seriously, it’s a decent regional favorite that rinses down hot dogs on a summer afternoon.
How about that nostalgic “5” I gave it, Overall? Bam!"
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.36,"Being from northeastern Ohio this has been a staple of my beer consuming years. Genesee is not a complex lager and is an easy drinking beer. There are no off setting flavors to speak of and its simplicity makes it very drinkable. Barley malt, yes, corn grits because that's what American and Canadian brewers use to brew for the masses and then finally
hops. Genesee ""red eye"" doesn't have the off putting vegetable oil flavor of MHL or the wet carboard flavor of A.B. You can drink 1 or 6, the flavor is consistent and if your in the mood for a boiler maker this is the perfect choice hands down."
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.81,"24 oz. can from Jackson’s. Nice looking with high tightly beaded head. For a lager not bad, light on the palate and not too much evidence of the adjunct grains. Crisp, clean, refreshing. Certainly better than some of the big boys, a good summer thirst quencher."
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.65,"It is true to the AAL style: yellow, corny, minimal head. However, it isn't that bad. It is inoffensive, and I'm certain that it many of your guests wouldn't complain if you had some at the house. Also, your pockets won't complain when you see the price you'll pay for it! I like the Cream Ale way better, but if I was at someone's house and they had some of this, I definitely would crack one open."
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.55,"25oz can. Poured out a crystal clear, straw-yellow color with a small, fizzy, white head of foam. It left no lacing on the glass. It smelled of corn, grains, caramel and some grasses. Sweet caramel taste with notes of corn and rice. Subtle bitterness."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.26,"This is one of the BEST CHEAP BEERS I can find!!! $16.99 for a 30 pack??? It blows ""Natty LIGHT"" out of the ""Throne"" of Bargain Brews by a MILE.... It actually has SOME Flavor and what IS there is actually VERY DECENT...
I see why it has a Loyal Fan Base... Good sub for SCHAEFFER since it seems NO MAS!!! Great beer to put on Top of your cooler at the ""Cornhole Tourney"" At least if your're going to get cornholed outa some beer, it'll be ~ $.50 cents apiece!!!"
Worst,Genesee Beer,1.69,There’s nothing better than getting crocked on some cheap beer... but this is just bad. The alc % is low and still tastes like Natty Ice. I can’t get over the after taste. I bought a 30 pack and could only drink two. This made me appreciate Old Crow! Lucky streak or Old German are better alternatives for a cheap buzz.
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.81,"24 ounce can into pilsner glass, canned on 5/22/2020. Pours crystal clear pale golden straw color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas and flavors of big lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, herbal, grassy earthiness. Some DMS fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, herbal, grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very good adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery. Nice clean pils/grain showcase, and earthy hop balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and impressive style example."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.06,"Do you have exactly $4 to your name, and want to get blitzed? This is the beer for you. Pretty simple AAL. Smells like corn, tastes like corn, looks like corn? Throw a shot of old crow in there to really get the party started. Kinda rough out of a can, but just fine in a glass. Nothing abhorrently wrong with this beer. Might be better off spending the extra $1 for narragansett. Hard to be too hard on this beer, as some are. Don’t expect a world class
Beer, but excels at what it is meant for."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.05,"Living in rochester, this is a staple its cheap, easy, and cheaper than bud. Light gold color, short light head goes down smooth. Also tastes about 4x better than other cheap beers, its actually solid but if you care about taste vs cost try one of gennesee craft flavors like the Ruby Red."
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.82,"(12 oz can, E309; purchased cold single... poured into Stella Artois glass)

L: clear, yellow-gold liquid; bit of dusty sediment floating about; white static sud-pad on pour, thin bubbly collar remains, no lace

S: relatively floral, grassy-herbal hop presence (fades off after a few moments), bit of a corn bread undertone... overall, like a bobo Bo'Pils-y; pretty poppin' for its ilk

T: odd sort of melon note up front, quickly followed by lightly-toasted corn meal and maybe a hint of nutty grassy grain... second sip, more of a dry cereal graininess, with a subtle peppery-spicy hop (or phenol?) swell in the finish, which grows in subsequent sips... really just flowers and corn bread halfway through, soft touches of fruit and spice

F: fairly dry, bit of spicy glow lingering; relatively shapeless, frayed-foamy texture... indeterminable start and finish (zips by), but the delicate afterglow is nice

O: intriguing, certainly worth revisiting... some odd quirks to dissect at first, but not an unusual adjunct lager by the end; actually moderately flavorful, with enough bottom-end dryness to allow for 5-6 more (1559)"
Worst,Genesee Beer,3.29,"24oz can stamped A259 1112:44 poured into a my vintage Spuds MacKenzie mug at fridge temp, no ABV specified on label. The beer pours bright straw yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes to a nice cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is acceptable by AAL standards with light grain, a bit of sweetness and faint vegetable tangy notes. The taste is mostly nuetral with slight cream corn and a little tangyness. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Just a hint of butter in the finish but cleaner that a lot of premium AALs. Overall, good. If I happened across a $6 / 12 pack in my travels, I'd probably bite. Thanks @woodychandler"
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.25,"A very clear pale yellow with a slight fruity smell when opened and poured. It does pour a frothy foamy head. It has a slight taste, a slight tinge of malt. The beer was quite slippery, watery when drank and it did leave a slight aftertaste. It tasted as if it would go well with cheese and crackers, making for a nice snack after having cut the grass. This beer, though not the most fabulous beer I ever had, would make a great summer-sessions beer. A great laid-back party beer with the boys while playing cards. (Between this one and the cream ale I do prefer the cream ale.)"
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.18,"I've been around awhile (64 years of age at time of this review), and Genesee at one time was a well made, tasty beer. It's lost much of its character over time.
Pours a deep yellow color, with a white head that vanishes quickly. Somewhat overcarbonated, no malt or hops in the nose. Light, VERY light malt flavor with the slightest hint of hops coming in late as you swallow.
I'm glad to see this brewery is still around, especially with the onslaught of takeovers in the late 70's and 80's, and I wish it many more years, but this old mainstay beer needs to return to its glory years when it was one of the better mainstream beers on the east coast."
Worst,Genesee Beer,2.27,"Poured from the can into a standard pint glass.

A: clear yellow, big, white, large bubbly head that dies down quickly into a collar leaving slight lacing.

S: Sewage. I can't describe it any other way. It smells like sewage. I've drank this on multiple occasions Their light beer, which I am guessing is a similar brew, does not have this nose. It's off-putting to say the least.

T: Luckily, it does NOT follow the nose. once you get it past the ol' sniffer, it's pretty much average AAL fare, corn and little hop.

M: Slick, medium bodied, standard AAL mouthfeel that's kinda refreshing once the corn dies down.

O: Right down the middle of the typical AAL. Crushable. I'd recommend the light version over this if you're just looking to drink outside in the heat."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.46,"The local beer store has been really good about single purchases of their beers and this was another that I picked up. Poured into a clear glass and the color was a light golden with a small white head. The smell was beer-like, nothing really special. Taste was okay and not as good as I expected. Would I drink it again? Sure, but I can’t say that I would seek it out."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.5,"24oz can. Poured out a clear, straw-yellow color with a small, fizzy, white head of bubbly foam. It left no lacing at all. It smelled of caramel, grains, corn and some grassy notes. Sweet caramel and grain taste with a bitter bite. Crisp and sharp."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.2,"Purchased as a single bottle from the nearest Citgo for $1.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear gold, with a minimal pale white head.
S - Corn flakes, biscuit, and grass.
T - Follows nose exactly. Finish is very clean.
F - Light-bodied; well-carbonated. Super drinkable. Refreshing.
O - It's a cheap macro, with simple flavors and barely a smell. However, this is one of the more palatable ones. I'd put this on-par with Natty Ice or Bud Ice, but there are definitely better macros for the price point that fit the vibe of this one. Probably won't buy again, but it's not too bad."
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.15,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds. This one is pretty decent - no offensive smells or flavors. A light-bodied, easy-drinking bready malt, but not as good as Labatt Blue all-around."
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.36,"24oz can stamped B19127 poured into a becher glass at fridge temp 5.6% ABV. The beer pours bright light golden in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Minimal lacing. The aroma is faint with vague corny and grainy notes. The taste is semisweet corn plus stewed mixed vegetables and vegetable oil. Minimal bitterness and a hint of tart. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and somewhat dry finish. Overall, not great, but it appears to be over two years old from the stamp. I'd drink again in the right setting with a fresher sample."
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.36,"It is a Canadian Adjunct Lager that you can only get in Canada. If you are in America you will only be able to get the ""Brewed in America"" water, grain, and freeze method. This is watching hockey or football beer. This is a summer and it is a hot day, or Oktoberfest is over. or your hockey team made it to the playoffs. Not sure why it is only getting a 65 but I liked it! It is smooth, drinkable, and has taste notes of adjuncts. The Maple leaf on the front fools Americans into buying a 30 pack for dirt cheap, calling it Canadian and even making a joke about the metric system, saying eh or cracks about geese, moose, and maple syrup."
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.4,"Okay, so as the first ice brewed beer ever made I have to give it props.

That being said, I put this in the freezer but the alcohol content isn't NEARLY enough to keep it from completely freezing. I don't understand the purpose of an ice beer if it can't be served ICE COLD.

Anyway, it is reasonably priced.

The flavor is pretty standard for an ice beer. Better tasting than Milwaukee's Best Ice.

I'm not really a fan of ice brewed beer, especially Keystone Ice, but this one is tolerable for what it's worth.

It's nothing to write home about. Just an ice brewed beer or how they say in the Frenchy part of Canada ""bière""."
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.67,OK SO ICE BEER Look strong amber appearance. Smell mellow slight red wine smell as well as aftertaste almost has a mouth feel of a dry red wine. Taste compared to a lot of other iced beers does not have a strong alcohol after taste. Mouth feel is average. Above average.
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.95,"$6/12 pack at my nearest Country Fair; fuck yeah, I'm buying that shit! Looks remarkably similar to the lo-cal IPA I just finished, just with a less attractive, more airy, faster dissipating head. Smells sweet with an almost candy apple undertone. Doesn't really smell bad at all, honestly. Taste kind of follows; lightly sweet with apple undertones. There's not a whole heckuva lot there. Low bitterness and too much carbonation. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was underage and didn't know any better. Now that I do, I kind of wish I had kept my six bucks."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.75,"Been a little while on this one. I thought it was an enjoyable ice style brew. In all things it was just below average, hence the overall rating of 2.75."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.56,"Sunday, November 11, 2018
12 ounce can poured to glass
Sight: Light yellow liquid, white foam
Smell: aroma of malt
Taste: low bitterness, low sweetness
Feel: good carbonation, good follow through, abrupt finish bitter aftertaste
Overall: good beer, not to repeat, not to look for"
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.56,"As ice beers go this one is reasonable. The color is a clear golden amber. The smell is weak. Not much of an aroma worth noting. The taste is good but not lasting. It isn't floral it is just a tinge of alcohol that has been 'beefed up' from the icing process. The feel is probably the best thing about this beer. It is certainly noticeable a little bit overwhelming, giving one a flush feeling. Overall, it would be a good party brew for a few friends while grilling burgers."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.61,"24 oz Can.
This doesn't look or smell any different than most macro beers. I am a fan of this style - but I only drink it if the weather is hot.
The Taste is fairly straightforward, nothing too complex. Getting lots of grain, some malt, some corn, taste the alcohol at the end. Moderate to high carbonation. Fairly enjoyable but very very simple beer. This is basically just plain 5.6% ABV beer. Would buy on occasion but there are better options in this style in my opinion.
Grade is a C"
Worst,Labatt Ice,3.38,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 11/10/2017. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness/carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery finish. Very slight increasing lingering warmth of 5.6%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink for the ABV. Definitely a bit more flavorful than the base beer as expected. Clean pale malt/grains and solid earthy hop presence for the style. Solid barley presence, not too heavy on the corn. An enjoyable and well made offering."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.02,"Isn't terrible for when you're on strict budget. The first one always has a funky taste but after that it's not bad. It is drinkable and gets the job done. It's hard to describe the taste, sweet, stale candyish?"
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.58,"Pours a pale yellow color with two fingers of white foam, quickly recedes to half a finger in size.
Smells...off, stale corn, light alcohol, cardboard, cut grass, maybe some malt.
Wow...light corn sweetness, bittering hops, and then straight to bread.
Mouthfeel is thin with a crisp, dry finish.
Overall, a bit less than average in my book. I like Molson ice more."
Worst,Labatt Ice,2.09,"Nabbed a 24 fl oz pull-tab can at a crappy bodega in Brooklyn, NY. Hey, where's my ""extra"" 1 oz the 25oz macros offer!?

5.6% ABV.

APPEARANCE: I knew what was coming and it delivered...pours your usual thin quickly-receding head (~20 second retention) and has that classic fizzy yellow body. Well, I guess it's more of a pale copper, but it's superbly clear, lacking any yeast/lees or other particulate. Appears undercarbonated and of low quality, tending towards the syrupy side for an adjunct lager (I prefer watery adjunct lagers, for the record).

AROMA: Corn syrup/extract brings the adjunct sweetness to the table, joining cheap 6-row barley and some syrupy graininess. I actually like the graininess as it lends some needed perceived bitterness. No luck on the hop front here - not even a generic floral hop aromatic. A blip of metallic character, but it's barely noticeable.

Certainly seems too sweet and suggests a syrupy brew, but it's not boozy and I don't get any DMS or other off-notes.

Aromatic intensity is quite light.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Too sweet and too syrupy, but not egregiously so on either count. I'll be able to kill this 24 fl oz can, and it's not boozy. No DMS, but there's some buttery flavour that might indicate potential diacetyl. No brettanomyces off-flavour. Corn syrup adjunct eclipses any graininess or 6-row, unfortunately.

Imbalanced and off-putting. Too thick for an adjunct lager and for its lack of flavour. Unrefreshing. I'd prefer a lighter body or even a watery feel. Smooth. Wet. Unappealing.

OVERALL: It's a pretty subpar brew across the board, with shallow depth of flavour, painful simplicity, and no hop flavour or interesting yeast character whatsoever. That said, I've had worse and it's not as sweet, syrupy, or off-flavour emphatic as many beers in the style. I'd be after Miller High Life, Hamms, Schaefer, or Genesee at a ball-game or summer barbeque over this, but it's preferable to many budget expressions of the style and I'll enjoy finishing the can. My low expectations were met but not exceeded, and sometimes you're in the mood for a mundane adjunct lager.

D (2.09) / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.53,"Clear, medium gold body; very nice carbonation; very little head, thin and patchy. Weak aroma; faint grain scent. Fairly bold grain flavor and sweetness; corn; mild hop bitterness. Medium body; smooth with a slight velvet feel and a mild warmth.

Not a bad lager for what it is.

Poured at 58 °F; the can label lists this is now a ""Classic Lager"" and brewed by Hornell Brewing Co. (part of Ferolito, Vultaggio & Sons, if I understand things correctly)."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.32,For a beer that's only $0.70 per 12 ounces is absolutely nothing to complain about. It's Better than most other cheap beers. It is not going to win any awards you will be pleasantly surprised how it taste for being so cheap.
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.31,This says lager on the 24oz can. For 1.25 for 24 oz I was intrigued. Popping the top I get grape juice. Pour is classic Amber with a weak head. On the taste I get grape juice with angostura bitters. Like a weak old fashioned. For $0.05 per oz I am not complaining. Not offensive and a great looking can. I think I found a new chugged to hang at the BBQ in 95 degrees.
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.66,"This isn't your normal type of beer, for 1.25 this is a friendly type of beer. Many may say "" oh it has a metallic taste"" but what were they drinking metal? Can't be compared to natty cause it doesn't taste water downed, can't be compared to let's say Heineken cause it's a bit malt liqour. This beer can hit the spot when you're in the dumps. Besides this the only other beer that can live up to it is the olde English 800. Too bad they don't make 40 oz of this cause damn that would sure turn the market around. God bless the U.S of A"
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.31,"Was unexpectedly heading to the local commuter train and passed a bodega so I decided to grab a beverage to enjoy on my hour long trip. I spied this wonderful looking 24 oz. can in the cooler and was immediately inspired to take a closer look. Hand crafted, the ""label"" said (BTW what do you call the outside of a can? It isn't technically a label, but I digress). American made. Original even. And a Classic Lager. How could it get any better? Than, in the upper left corner of the aforementioned ""label"" was the coup de grace. $1.25! How could it be possible for such a highly touted product to be priced at such an inviting level? And for 1 PT, 8 FL OZ of anticipated golden nectar. It could only because prime example of American ingenuity at its finest. I had to have it and have it NOW!

Caught my train by the skin of my teeth. Found a seat and prepared myself for the journey, both in the physical and the emotional. As the train departed the station, I cracked open the plebian tab that stood between me and the experience I so longed to have.

How to rate this libation? How to describe it? The question of look remains unexplored. It is truly unfair to fault the beer for this so I fairly (I feel) out this required rating smack dab in the middle of the field. How could one even consider using and vessel but the magnificent aluminum that naturally covers it. Luckily the aroma is able to we escape through the approximately inch wide circle created by the escape valve commonly referred to as the tab. I can think of no other words to describe this than sickeningly sweet. This is not a value judgement, mind you, but a descriptive fact. A negative? Who am I to make such a judgement on an esteemed product like Crazy Stallion.

But we know why you all are here. To discover the taste, the flavor, how does Crazy Stallion tickle the tongue. I can only confirm that I absolutely got my $1.25 (actually $1.50 once you calculate the government's share of the experience) of value. And what more can one truly ask for. Indeed, what more. This Crazy Stallion was possibly one of the finest travelling companions I have ever had on a commuter rail journey."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,1.25,"I picked up a 24oz tallboy at my local bodega for $1.25. I drank about half and poured the rest out. Has a awful sour metallic taste, like it’s been sitting in the can for years. I won’t buy it again."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,2.95,"$1.25 for a 24 oz beer can't beat that these days. I was pretty surprised how good this beer was. Tasted pretty good and if it's 5.9% abv then that is amazing. Doesn't really taste like its 5.9% seems about maybe 5% or somewhere between 4% to 5% abv but it says 5.9% on here so I guess that's what it is.

I was thinking this was gonna be more crazy than it was you know since it says Crazy Stallion I was thinking it would be some pretty good stuff like Natty Daddy but was quite mild for the name crazy stallion. Should probably just be called grazing stallion or something like that.

Taste reminds me of those cheap no brand beers they sell at some places that are about 4% to 5% abv. Taste reminds me of that cheap beer they sell at walgreens you get the 6 pack for like 3 or 4 dollars or something.

The taste is pretty good for the price kind of a low carbonated flavor beer pretty decent. The main thing is the type of buzz you get really which seemed to be like a sleepy beer. Had to take a nap felt drowsy after drinking this. Not really a stimulating beer. But probably gonna definitely give it some more tries to see what its like some more. Maybe I may try this beer again but seems like that beer they sell at walgreens and has the same drowsy effect.

This crazy stallion is like the arizona ice tea of beers pretty much cheap and its just beer."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.09,"Pours a clear golden/amber with a ton of head.
Smell is hard to peg. Sort of a metallic malt.
Taste is not as horrible as expected. Malty of course and mildly sweet.
Not to boozy.
Drink to get hammered, not to have flavor. Extra credit for cool ass can."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,3.26,"I about sprayed my shorts when I found this at the corner store for a whole $1.25, so I couldn't resist. I figured it couldn't be any worse than some of those other gut-wrenching malt liquors I've tried lately so I gave it a go. Needless to say I wasn't impressed nor was I dissapointed. For $1.25, it wasn't bad. I was expecting that overwhelming malt liquor taste but instead I was hit with a mouthful of aluminum tasting smooth. I have no idea what the alcohol content is as the can doesn't mention it anywhere to my knowledge but not to long after binging it, I felt a wee bit buzzed. I think after downing about 6 of these in rapid succession I will gain a new perspective on life. In conclusion if you're looking for something tasty, this isn't for you. If you are however seeking something buzz-worthy I'd give this a go."

D / NOT RECOMMENDED

03/23/17 2nd impression from a 24 fl oz can I couldn't resist picking up for a scant $1.25 in Brooklyn.

""Ale."" ""American made."" ""Strong lager."" ""Brewed by Hornell Brewing Co., La Crosse, WI.""

APPEARANCE: Off-white head retains for about 2 minutes, leaving no lacing as it recedes. Body colour is a clear yellow-copper of average vibrance. Clean, with no yeast/lees within.

AROMA: Malt syrup/extract, corn adjunct, metallic off-notes, graininess, stale grass.

The graininess is nice, but the rest suggests an abysmal overly sweet sticky brew that will be a chore to finish. Aromatic intensity is subdued.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Syrupy and sweet, with an off-puttingly thick hefty presence on the palate that's quite poor when coupled with its sharp overcarbonated. Metallic off-flavour really cripples this brew, but it's cloying and corn adjunct-emphatic besides. There's not a lot to like here, and I think I'd take a watery thinness over this syrupy consistency.

Alcohol isn't disguised, but it's not a hot or boozy beer by any stretch.

OVERALL: Quite poorly executed fare for a malt liquor (or ""strong lager,"" as they style it). The adjunct isn't necessarily what bugs me; the bigger issues are the mouthfeel and off-flavours. I've encountered more offensive beers with far more imbalance, but this isn't a beer I'd revisit over others in the budget category, and I think Ballantine XXX is worth the extra ~4 cents per ounce more, unless your only goal is intoxication (in which case, why aren't you drinking St. Ides or High Gravity Steel Reserve?). Certainly a student beer to put it politely, but neither the worst nor the best of them. I'll finish the can with some effort, but I can't recommend it to anyone.

D (2.12) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
07.13.17 impression from a budget can acquired at a wrap party after a film shoot:

Clear pale copper body with a thin white coloured cap atop. Head retention is okay; 2-3 minutes but reducing inconsistently and with abrupt ""pops"" of head loss. Leaves some inconsistent cobwebby lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes.

Aroma is of corn adjunct, slightly syrupy 6 row sweetness, and a borderline funky skunkiness as though the beer is lightstruck in spite of coming from a can. Has an off-putting stale metallic edge. No real hop aromatics aside from faded grass. Reticent aromatically but nevertheless suggestive of a largely insipid brew aside from its evident off-flavours. I've encountered far worse aromas and it doesn't seem *that* syrupy.

Taste isn't awful but it has an off-putting syrupy mouthfeel coupled with a style-inappropriate dryness on the finish that really brings it down for me. The adjunct isn't actually all that noticeable, hiding beneath the more overt up-front cheap 6-row barley sweetness. Hops aren't a factor in this build, with none of the stale grass the aroma suggested coming through...though it'd be strangely welcome.

Not dreadfully overcarbonated, nor is it watery - which is more than I can admit about many a beer offered at this price in the U.S.A. to its credit. One can imagine the off-flavour(s) more prominent.

It's a poor brew, no doubt, but it isn't repugnant or egregious in its bad execution. I've had worse, and this isn't as syrupy or boozy as many malt liquors. Its main draw for any drinker - casual or discerning - will be its price, but that has no effect on my rating. It's a rough garbage brew that even buzz-hungry students in its distribution region will turn their noses up at, and you can do far better even with less money in terms of purely-for-drunkiness beers, but all things considered it's not abysmal...and that might be the best thing I can say about it.

Low D / AVERAGE"
Worst,Crazy Stallion,1.73,"This beer doesn't deserve a fancy review, much the same way a frozen dinner wouldn't be admitted in a cook-off. This beer costs a buck, and you get exactly what you'd expect to get - you get trashed for a couple bucks. This is a great later-in-the-night beer when your taste buds are already fried, or for beer pong and other fast & loose drinking games, or for severe money-savers. Either way, don't expect much. Really, don't expect anything except a metallic, very hoppy yet somewhat easy-going-down ghetto swill. I'm no beer expert but you really don't need to be when the price is blaring on the can: 99 CENTS. So enjoy your dollar beer or four - hell, it's still a great value."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,1.25,A totally crummy beer that tastes like liquid aluminum and smells like it too. But hey it was 99 cents. Wouldn't buy it again unless I had only a dollar to my name though.
Worst,Crazy Stallion,2.69,"It's a cheap Malt Liquor, pretty much just a session beer. Tastes exactly like the price would lead you to assume. This is more of an ""I want to get drunk"" kind of beer than a fancy, tasty beer, but at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can, can you really argue with it?"
Worst,Crazy Stallion,1.06,"I happened to be at a local deli. Scrapping spare change and decided for only a dollar
Why not give it a try.

This beer is downright gnarly.

Out of the can its even worse

The taste is metal
And the smell is also a metallic funk

Hands down the worst beer I have ever had. Try it for a review, that's about it."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,2.78,"40 ounce bottle
Served in a pilsner glass

A - It has a golden hue to it. Generous amounts of rocky, white head cling to the sides of the glass.

S - I get the typical grain and grass of a malt liquor, but I also get some soap which leans toward some floral hops.

T - It really lacks flavor. Typically, malt liquors have an alcohol taste and some off flavors. I get a little of the grain and grass, but it tastes more like an adjunct lager.

M - Thin

O - This is a pretty tame malt liquor. It is weaker tasting than most. It goes down easy and was a great way to celebrate today's holiday."
Worst,Crazy Stallion,1.08,"A - Pours dark nasty gold with a one finger head. No lacing.

S - metal, aluminum. That's it.

T - Metal, aluminum. That's it.

M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation.

O - Overall, pretty much a nice big load of garbage. Perhap s SLIGHTY above Steel reserve."
Worst,Gallo Draft,1.21,"This is literally the second worst beer I have ever had. If you're ever in Guatemala, TAKE YOUR OWN BEER.
Looks like piss
Smells like sour skunk, and not the good kind
Tastes worse
Feels like a decent-ish macro, so it's go that going for it

You should try it if you go to Guatemala, but only for that nostalgic moment of ""So when i was in Guatemala, I had this horrible beer called Gallo..."""
Worst,Gallo Draft,2.68,"A: Looks like MGD

S: Smells like Miller Lite + metal

T: Tastes like Miller Lite + 1 drop lemon juice + metal

M: Fizzy water

D: Good when you're in the hot jungle

The really sad part is I'd probably have chosen this over bud lite. At least you could taste some malt in there somewhere."
Worst,Gallo Draft,1.03,"A: An ugly yellow urine color, decent head of foam;

S: Clear essences of tepache (drink pinneapple-based alcoholic fermented);

T: Mixture of mineral water, sugar and rice;

M: Watery and sour;

D: I don't finished it, this beer took away the taste of some tamales i was eating."
Worst,Gallo Draft,1.83,"Gallo Draft pours a clear light yellow color with a foamy head and almost no lace, Lots of carbonation; Not much aroma, maybe some corn and hops, some skunky; Taste is thirst quenching and refreshing; Mouthfeel is thin and watery; Drinkability... not impressed.

¡Salud!"
Worst,Gallo Draft,1,"No taste, no aroma, slow malt, and much rice, again like its style, this style is not my favorite, by way, i tried this beer a few months ago and only one time purchase because its low drinkability, appearance like a MGD, but dont touch its heel, aluminum can not have a good design, its very ugly."
Worst,Gallo Draft,4.1,"Perhaps a combination of Gallo and Dorada draft. BUt it is nice, a little tiring but it would be great for a party or a football match at the television. The hops are there, but they are not tiring, what it is tiring it is a little the yeast. HOwever, they managed to have a bubbling beer."
Worst,Quilmes,2.57,"Sep. 2011: 330 ml bottle, as Quilmes Cerveza, from Super Cor, La Manga (Spain). ABV is 4.9%. Pale yellow colour, pearly carbonation, low and short-lived head. Sweetish aroma, notes of maize, grass and citrus. Tolerably fresh flavour, notes of citrus. An okay refreshment on a hot day, nothing more."
Worst,Quilmes,2.82,"The pour is straw yellow with a moderate flow of carbonation. The taste is Oh well, at least now I can say that I have had a beer from Argentina. Cheers! C"
Worst,Quilmes,2.8,"Body is light golden yellow, medium to high carbonation. Head is around 1.5 fingers that quickly diminishes leaving a slight froth. Smell is some sulphur and grains but is quite faint. Taste is straw and grains, quite astringent and thin. Finish is sparkly and a bit soapy. I didn't find it especially refreshing which is no good in a pale lager. It's only worth trying to tick off a country. I believe it's ""the"" beer of Argentina so there you go."
Worst,Quilmes,3.46,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving just a touch of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is light overall, but is heaviest of a slightly grainy and bready smell mixed with some smells of caramel. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a caramel malt taste that has a bit of grain and a decent shot of doughiness. As the taste advances some flavors of a light herbal and hay taste come to the tongue. All the while the sweet caramel fades a bit and the doughiness gets more cracker like in nature. These transitions cause the taste to crisp up a bit and leave one with a somewhat lighter and more crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the flavor profile the feel is rather well done and makes for a very easy sipper overall.
Overall – Nothing spectacular, but very easy drinking and rather refreshing overall. A rather nice warm weather session brew!"
Worst,Quilmes,2.15,"My tour of adjunct lagers continues. Quilmes pours a thin gold, with little to no aroma and a light straw aftertaste. It’s largely forgettable. I'd pass, if there's better options."
Worst,Quilmes,2.8,"As usual, the inventory at Total Wine at The Forum in Selma, TX, is messed up so this beer isn’t on my itemized receipt. Therefore priceless. Reviewed 9/27/19.
Stamped on bottom of label “10/22/19”. On shelf at store, stored and served at reefer temperature.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Very light yellow, nearly colorless, clear.
Body – Light yellow, clear, effervescent.
Head – Average (Maximum three cm, aggressive center pour), white, high density, average duration, diminishing to a two to three mm crown and complete thin cap.
Lacing – Good. Wide band of small bubbles with stalactites and some thin columns connecting.
Aroma – 3 – Initially, some weak grain and some dimethylsulfide. Fades to nothing. Unoffensive.
Flavor – 2.5 – Slightly bitter without any hop taste. No alcohol (4.9% ABV) flavor or aroma, no diacetyl.
Palate – 3 – Thin, watery, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation – 3 – Not very good or very bad, just bland and wet. Drinkable if desperate, dehydrated, or broke but certainly nothing to seek out."
Worst,Quilmes,1,"Es una cerveza ligera, espumosa, de carbonatación media. Tiene algún detalle de malta y cebada en su sabor pero es un producto de baja calidad con un sabor final casi inexistente. En sus publicidades anunciaba ""beberla bien helada"". O sea, a una temperatura incorrecta."
Worst,Quilmes,3.31,"Bright gold body; crystal clear; lively carbonation; thin yet sticky, white head. Mild, grainy aroma; a touch of sweetness with a little fruitiness. Toasted malt flavor; low hop bitterness; clean. Medium-light body; crisp and dry.

A decent, malt-forward lager. Satisfying."
Worst,Quilmes,3.36,"Served in a pint glass from the bottle.

Appearance: Pure yellow with medium bubbles and an easy carbonation on the body with a head head rising about one finger's legnth off the body.

Smell: Hops and a tad sour scent.

Taste: Bland but super refreshing considering how humid it is today in New York.

Mouth: Medium carnation and semi sticky but a little on the lower side.

Overall: Second time I had this beer in don't know how many years. Did the job, and considering the low beer selection I had at the place I was visiting it will do. Salud!"
Worst,Quilmes,3.43,"I thought this Euro Pale?/American Adjunct? Lager was alright, in the acceptable range (nothing pro, nothing con, just a flavorless lager), but my wife says it is too thin, watery. Could this be the reason why I'm okay with these lagers? Flavorless, refreshing when cooled down, go well with any food. I appreciate this having grown up on the truly bad Euro Lagers of Central-Eastern Europe. So I say it is okay, and I don't expect anything more."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.82,"Taste: very crisp, light malts, hint of honey sweet, mild hops. mild earthy grain nose. Very pale straw colored hue, clear, with white foam head and small lace. light body. Mild to a fault."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,1.51,"Another in the Northern Series. Cold Spring just keeps on keepin on.

Pours a finger of white head that fades down. Decent retention for the ring that is left. Color is a clear golden orange.

Aroma: Sweet and malty. Caramel malts stick out the most. Grains.

Taste: This beer almost reminds me of a watered down bock. All malts. Caramel and bready. Candy-like sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Kind of bland. Light bodied with a higher amount of carbonation. Ends dry and bland... a very bad aftertaste.

Overall, another beer that is cheap and I could drink if I had to, but I would never actually seek this out. It is more flavorful than bmc beers, but the mouthfeel is just off."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,3.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, some corn. Taste is crisp, slightly sweet, grains and malts, very refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer on a hot summer night."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,3.86,"Despite my (seeming) many hatas, I am proud to say that The CANQuest is going to CANtinue unabated! I walked into one of my locals in search of a DFH Ancient Ale, found two and proceeded back to the coolers, where I found a couple of new CANs! CAN you dig it?!? And just in time for New Beer Sunday ...

The woodland pattern on the CAN reminded me of hunting season and the Crack really got me in the game. The Glug produced nearly two fingers of dense bone-white head that seemed determined to hang around even in the heat and humidity that had reduced my collection of chocolate Easter Bunnies to syrup. Dang! Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity and with the current price of gold, I felt like I had a bargain. Nose was filled with cereal adjuncts, but I have come to expect that from the style. It was nothing new nor terribly unpleasant. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste reminded me of coconut oil. I kid you not, it was like massaging oil onto some honey honey's back while down at the shore! This is CANsidered unpleasant by the majority? Dudes, do you know how coveted Maui's Coconut Porter is?!? The flavor on this may not have been intended, but it is a winner. Stylistically, it is out of bounds, but I am not a style guideline guy and it barely shook the needle. The finish was crisp and lightly sweet and I did not mind its getting warm, which is not something that I CAN say for the majority of AALs.

Drinakbility was rather good. I would definitely be taking this to the beach, especially at its price point. Maybe I should take a cue from this and put the doll's coconut oil in the cooler also ..."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,1.48,"My buddy brought two cases of this stuff up for fishing opener, and I felt obliged to pour one into a glass and review.

This beer pours pale golden yellow with a foamy white head that quickly settles to nothing. Smell is rather metallic, with some gariany hints, and a slight floral character. This however, all fades within a few minutes. The taste is not much better. Grainy with some slight grassy hints, along with a tinge of musty water. This is the typical case beer they brew up at this location. Will they ever get anything right? Or will they just keep making cheap beer for the Minnesota masses? This is just downright bad beer. Can I even call it beer?"
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.48,"pours out a brilliant golden colour with an egg shell white head supported by some big bubbled carbonation. head quickly reduces to some sparse lace. definite adjunct aroma...corn syrup with a hard to place light malty nose and maybe a hint of spice like hops. semi-sweet malty flavour and dashes of caramel corn. a definite metallic twang that is way out of place, also. carbonated metallic mouthfeel, like sucking on a penny...semi slick with a dose of spritzy crispness. drinkability is ok if you chug this ice cold. as it warms it becomes a mess and certainly less enjoyable.

well, this is certainly better than the gluek lineup that was so rightly villified. but only marginally so. would be good ice cold on a hot day or a beer to boil brats in."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,1.45,"DOES ANYONE KNOW THE ABV. OF THIS BEER??
-
I picked this up at Grocery Outlet for $7.68 for a 12 pack of 16 oz. tall boy cans. Pretty good deal! I haven't been in a Grocery Outlet in over 20 years. I only stopped in to see if they had some cheap beer and they did! two choices! This was one of them. The other had Hook in the name and was an ale but it wasn't Red Hook. I like lager better.

serving type: can.
apopearance: drinking from the can. :)
smell: malt, citrus
taste: touch of hops, some very small malt (i think), grass, lemon.
mouthfeel: water. that slight lemon finish is all there is to this beer. nothing offensive about it.
drinkability: i thought rolling rock was the wateriest beer I'd ever has but now the prize goes to this bad boy. it was worth it to buy. For 16 beers that you get here (twelve 16 oz. cans = 16 beers) it's worth it. It's cheap and drinkable. I like the labeling a lot but it's a lot more attractive than the flavor of the beer and makes you think you're getting something higher class than the cheap ass brew this is. Any more than two and your desire to want more will lessen and lessen. Very boring but cheap and cheap WINS if you're asking would i purchase this again!!"
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.85,"Pale gold, rapid trails of visible carbonation. Flimsy cap of foam that dies down after the initial pour.
Pretty textbook appearance for the style.

Dusty wheat, minerals, faint apple sweetness.

Flavor is sort of odd, mild peanut butter (trace specialty malt?), apple astringency, otherwise a watery and flaccid feel. I'll hand it to Cold Spring, this doesn't taste like your average macro lager... but what does it taste like? There's some husky grain chaff and malt complexity actually, but it's very faint and never fully develops. Carbonation is weak, and the overall feel is dull.

When cold it would quench on a summer day, but that's about it. Novelty ""craft"" lager."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,3,"a: pours a pale yellow color with about a quarter inch of head that disappears quickly leaving a slight trace of lace around the edge of the glass
s: sweet corn malts a faint hint of hop bitterness to balance. true to style not overly impressive
t: sweet corn malt standard macro lager taste. there is a hint of bitterness to make it palatable.
m: light bodied beer, slightly less carbonation than other examples of this style

If you want a cheap beer pong beer, this is a decent choice. If you want something to pair with food, this style is not what you should be looking for"
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.68,"Appearance is light straw in color with a thick crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell of grainy adjunct rice, corn and minimal hops. Taste agian of grainy adjunct that has a light sweetness that finishes fairly clean. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. For $8 bucks a halfer its not all bad."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.72,"From two year old notes.

Pale yellow with a big fizzy greyish white head that melts quickly. The nose is mostly corny grits and used up hops. The taste is light and slightly metallic with a just the ghost of fruity hops. Light bodied with high carbonation. A pretty average example of the style."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.08,"Pours a brilliant, very pale yellow, topped with a creamy-white head which dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lace in its stead.

Well-carbonated.

The nose is not what I expected; sweet, cooked vegetables with more than just a hint of vanilla. A Pilsener this ain't.

The taste is a little more like what I had been expecting, but only a little. Sweet, almost overly sweet, with almost no bitterness. But wait! There's a little pale, biscuity malt poking through here and it is a relief, it saves this beer from use as Slug-bait and/or Drainpour Land (although the first would certainly be a good use for this stuff...).

Smooth, yes, but very thin-bodied, very much like a Diet or Light lager -- I'm guessing that better than 30% of the fermentables bill is corn syrup. Mouthfeel is about the same as the taste...

This one would be perfect for playing Beer Pong --or filling water balloons.

Served chilled, in a shaker pint."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.49,"Cheap macro beer. It will always have a special place in my heart. Not this specifically, but in general. Dinkytown Wine and Spirits recently added this to the shelves so I had to buy a case.

At less than $10 a case, you can't really go wrong. If you don't like it, give it to you friends when they are at a heightened state of inebriation and they will gladly take it. There you go, no love lost, and despite losing 10 bucks, hey you tried.

I actually prefer this to most macro's and light beers. Its really not bad. Very drinkable and good amount of carbonation. Its light and smooth with sweet malts detectable. The only downside is the awful smell. Maybe I got a bad batch, but it was putrid."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,1.77,"hmm, don't know what i was thinking with this one. Grabbed it out of a fridge, the only thing available--figured, why not. i'll give it a go.

Clear gold, little head fading to no head, obviously no lacing. Smell is corny, taste is standard american macro with a little something else, nothing good, its off, maybe it tastes a little like vanilla, can't really place it or figure out where it would have come from. Mouthfeel is so watery with high carbonation, pretty terrible.

This beer drinks like tainted water, so i guess it goes down pretty easily but it leaves you with nothing that would make you want another."
Worst,Northern Reserve Golden Lager,2.64,"This beer pours a clear pale golden color. The head is small to begin with, and disappears completely after only a cople seconds. The aroma is of caramel with a splash of grapefruit, and is very strong for the style (which I like). The taste, on the other hand, is not nearly as strong as the aroma, but still shows hints of caramel and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is watery thin, with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this beer is quite a bit better than I had expected. However, I still would not drink it again."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,"12oz green bottle stamped 2731 17:55 poured into a vintage pint glass at fridge temp 4.8% ABV. Label says it's brewed and bottled at Matt Brewing NY. The beer pours bright, very pale gold with off white head. The head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island leaving rings of lacing after each sip. The aroma is skunk, hay and light malt in that order. The taste is semisweet, slightly skunky, with a hint of malt and hay. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, ok rice beer."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,1.86,Put off trying this one for a while because the bottle suggests over compensation was likely. One of the worst tasting beers I've ever had in my life (from a bottle). Somewhere in the ballpark of Tsintao but none of the clean qualities - had a dirty taste closer to animal urine. Would probably be a more useful weapon in a barfight than addition in an esky.
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.2,"L: Poured a pale gold with a frothy white 2 finger head that quickly disappears, leaving be hind a thin white cap and little lacing on the glass.

S: Lightly hoppy aroma with a little spice.

T: Peppery hop taste with no malt flavor to back it up.

F: Smooth and lightly tingly on the tongue, easily quaffable. No alcohol burn.

O: easy to drink several in one sitting. Much preferred over Tsing Tao. Not as dry as Asahi. Overall, not bad for a rice beer."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.35,"Total panther piss. But the coolest bottle ever, well worth the purchase. Immerse the bottles in ice, serve mind-numbingly cold, drink directly out of the bottle and everyone's happy."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.25,Simple flavors as expected so i had it with dinner. It has a slight skunky smell but it didn't translate to taste which is a guy thing. Slightly sweet. On par for this style as i thought it would be.
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,4.07,"I really liked it. It has some lime notes, it is light and refreshing. Its smoother then I thought it would be which is great. Delicious summer drink, and the bottle is beautiful!"
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.43,"Let's address one thing to start. This bottle is the coolest I've ever seen for any packaged beverage in my opinion. 5/5 for sure on the packaging. The beer, however, is very average and similar to every Euro green bottled lager of all time. The beer pours into the classic straw color of most green bottle brews, but does produce a fairly frothy white top for a beer as session-like as this. Corn and grain notes are prominent in the scent and thats really accurate for the taste too. Not really impressed, but it is smooth, crisp and refreshing. Would I enjoy it if I was having a steak dinner? Probably not my choice for the ""only one beer tonight"" night. But, the Buddha will protect you from the next morning hangover if you crack one too many of his enlightened beer. I had good fortune and luck the day after crushing a few."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,5,Great tasting beer. Crisp. Easy drinking. Taste like a typical European green bottled beer. Very pleased. The taste matches the beauty of it's bottle.
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.98,"L: Pours straw yellow with a nice two-finger white head with decent retention.
S: Sweet grains, malty, corn, bread.
T: Taste certainly follows the nose, nothing to extraordinary about it though.
F: Light-medium bodied, high carbonation, crisp, refreshing & crushable.
O: Not a bad brew at all, certainly one you could session."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.94,"Bottle is awesome but didnt match the brew inside. Very non-memorable and very ho-hum compared to some other asiatic lagers. Easy to drink and not unpleasant, but not worth the price just for cool bottle"
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.66,"besides having one of the coolest bottles ever, this brew is lacking anything resembling a personality.
however, if you are looking to just hammer a six out and could care less about *how* the brew get you there, you probably won't be disappointed. it is pretty ""lively"" compared to say Coors or Miller etc.
just don't mistake the cool bottle for housing anything unique.
this is a pretty great sessioner though, especially given the novelty."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.48,"330ml Buddha bottle

Smells and looks like corn. Corny. Actually looks very beautiful, clear, piss-yellow, very carbonated with a champagne like foam. But the smell and taste is all burned corn and alky hol

It's very average, bordering on below average. Extra points for Buddha bottle"
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,2.91,"Appearance slightly darker than a usual lager of this variety, a little brown. Usual 12 finger head that quickly vanished into
ring of froth, (it gains a plus 0.25 for a unique bottle). Slight vegetable aroma. Taste is relatively tasteless save for a bit of rice and corn coming through. Mouthfeel is slightly soapy and fizzy. I didn't care for it."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.7,"Thanks to JLindros for sharing this beer. Very cool Buddha bottle.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice crystal clear golden hue with a fat one finger white head that fades to leave thin wisps.

S - Aromas of sweet malts, almost corn like, decent rice element however the rice develops a bit of a burnt quality. Very little bit of skunk like aroma.

T - Taste is similar to the nose with big malt sweetness and a flash of rice. The rice element is pleasant but it's almost got a burnt flavour. Almost skunky.

M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, crisp, clean.

O - Overall this was a solid enough rice lager, my only knock is that it's on a skunky side...plus the rice has a bit of a burnt aroma and flavour. Still, solid enough.

Serving Type: Bottle"

POurs a med foamy frothy head with moderate retention, a bit of lacing, crystal clear golden straw color

Nose is interesting, lots of raw malt and rice wine like, lots of Asian but soft lager, a bit of floral hops, a bit of toasted burnt rice, grainy malt and sweet rice mostly, touch of skunk

Taste more sweet rice and grainy malt, doughy like lager malt, light in general but fair malt character, toasted rice, some sweetness and sugar character, light herbal hop with a hint of bitterness, a touch of skunk again, a bit of burnt rice and old malt character

Mouth is med to lighter bod, low to med carb, light in general

Overall surprisingly better than I thought, but still skunky and thin, but malt was decent"
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,3.02,"I didn't know this was a rice lager when I bought it, sad I know. Anyway, it is not a horrible beer....it just is not a good beer. The taste is kinda weak and the feel is skunky overall but the bottle looks great. Maybe it is a great rice lager?? But I just can't say it is a great tasting beer overall."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,4.6,"I tried this be er because it said it was a rice logger, so I was hoping it would be gluten-free. First of all the bottle caught my eye. Having tried many gluten-free beers I really enjoyed the taste and the smell of this beer. I noticed the feel in my mouth afterwards was a little grainy feeling but that is also common in a gluten-free beer. As long as the malt in it does not bother me I would definitely buy this again."
Worst,Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer,1.94,"Tastes like Rolling Rock had sex with a Heineken while high on skunk piss. The bottle is really cool. I mistook this beer as being from Funky Buddha. Big mistake. It says Lucky Buddha, but hopefully it's luckier than it tastes."
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,2.77,"From bottle, Clear pale gold, no head and flat looking. Aroma mixes wet cardboard with grainy malt. Light body and lightly fizzy. Worth a try on a hot day."
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,1.76,"This beer is a no carb beer. It is very weak in colour, reminding me of your standard American beer rather than an Australian beer. However the taste is not totally watery. I would still rather drink this than Budweiser!"
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,2.11,"Straw yellow color, no head retention, very light smell of fruits, crispy taste is slightly grainy and slighlty sour, semi-dry finish, watery feeling, very low body"
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,1.48,"Bottle: has a child with an enormous head on it. Enough said.

Appearance: considering this is a 'no-carb' beer, not too bad. That said, it looks a bit weak and flat, with a bubbling head that dissipates too quickly.

Aroma: very little in the way of aroma. What vague whiff is apparent is standard grains. Quite dull.

Taste: I don't really see the point of beers like this. Breweries have to understand that if a beer has almost no flavour, the only flavour that will come through is an awful, skunky off-metal grain. Mighty unimpressive.

Aftertaste: disappears quickly, thank God. Still, that's half the problem - there isn't that much flavour to begin with.

Mouth feel: thin and watery, with limited carbonation. Just keeps getting better...

Overall: a pointless and hatefully awful beer from a brewer that ought to know better. With their range of fantastic beers, this is a truly awful deviation from the norm. Add to that the fact that it is the price of standard full-strength, it is actually quite insulting. If you want a beer, buy one. If you really want a decent boutique light, get a Rogers Beer. If you just want a reasonable light lager, go for your standard macro White Stag, XXXX Gold, Cascade Light, etc. I can assure you they are much, much better value, and taste a whole lot better. Rant over."
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,1.61,"@tobeerornottobe said ""Do you have a lighter beer?"" Oh yes, I sure do...

Pours very clear and very light, with minimal body and a filmy, pure white head. Lacing is relatively persistent and leaves a pleasant frothy pattern down the inside of the glass. No, it's not a brilliant looking beer, but it's very decent for the style.

Nose is crisp and adjuncty, with a note of corn or DMS, and a slightly sharper I-almost-want-to-call-it-hoppiness. But then it sinks back to sweet corn syrup and light vomitous astringency. No, not for me.

Taste is almost devoid of character, even feeling—it's as though this beer disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth. Very thin and only leaving a hint of that corn because it has to. Really reminiscent of a wet tortilla. Appalling.

Really horrible beer., of the kind that makes you scream out in disgust as to why it was ever brewed. No carb beer? It should be illegal."
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,1.68,"Pours gold with a very small white head.
Nose is massively skunky. Underneath is... nothing.
Flavours show sweet vegetal notes at first before transitioning to cardboard characters. No bitterness.
Carbonation is a bit over the top, body is watery.
I'm somewhat confused as to why Burleigh brewed this?"
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,1.68,"Poured from bottle into the glass.

Not of good beer. Claims to be be a no carb beer, better described as a no taste beer.

Almost clear in appearence. And lacked any sort of smell.

Given the lack of colour and smell it was not surprising that it lacked a certian amount of taste. It wasn't an offensive taste, it just didn't taste of anything. It was refreshing I give it that, and if it was really, really hot, it would be a plesant drinking experience, but if you actually want your beer to taste like beer, I'd give it a miss.

It seemed to have gone after the gimmick (nop carbs) rather than trying to produce a flavoursome beer. It's a shame as I hear the rest of the Burleigh range is okay."
Worst,Burleigh Bighead,2.13,"Australia's first NO-carb beer...um ok.

A- Golden and clear, medium head which dissipates quickly leaving little to no lacing.

S- Very little of any aroma, some malt sweetness and very light fruity hop aroma. Very light

T- Light sweetness, simple grain bill is obvious. Little to no malt character. Some Dyacetyl. Very light bitterness. A slight hop flavour of apple skin. Overall very bland

M- Low carbonation, doesnt help things. Thin and watery body. Quite smooth is the only positive, it doesnt seem to show as many of the tinny, chemical, artificial and over filtered feeling you get with a macro beer.

D- a pretty disappointing beer. I can see why they would want to get on the bandwagon with the whole (frankly usless) low carb influx but its disappointing to see it coming from a microbrewery. I know its low carb so not to expect much but... why bother?"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.54,"Red Horse Extra Strong is crystal clear and pale amber in color. Thin streams of carbonation support a cloudy bone white head with fairly average retention.
Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is generic, almost sugary sweetness. Soda cracker comes in second, lending support to the up front aromas of sugar. Aromas of malt and sugar lead into a center where I smell corn adjuncts and the lagery whiff of sulfur. Mix in the alcoholic burn of this beer's 8% abv and the aroma takes on a vaguely white wine quality. The finish is full of the leafy, fresh cut grass smell of European hops.
On the tongue, flavors of corn adjunct and alcoholic spiciness dominate up front. Those flavors lead right into flavors of sulfur. Those flavors combine in a way that isn't very flattering or enticing. Flavors of soda cracker or baked bread are nonexistent. Sugary sweetness provides an interesting through note, adding just enough to the proceedings to give an unflattering illusion of white wine. Bitter is crisp and bitter.
It's just not that good a beer. It's almost as though the brewery took every thing people hate about lager and distilled them together into one product. Red Horse Extra Strong's only real redeeming feature is that it's inexpensive and it's strong. Beyond, I'd give this beer a hard pass."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.13,Bought this at the local Filipino market in a pint can four pack. Pours a large foamy head but then dissipates quickly - clear golden color. Aroma is very bready and malty not much else to speak of. Taste is surprisingly light given the high ABV. I would compare this to Steel Reserve - but the taste is lighter and a bit more bitter yet sweet at the same time. Not a bad beer and worth a try if you're curious.
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.62,"A - Pours a clear crystal lager colour with a white head that reduces quickly.

S - Nothing of note except some small malt.

T - Again nothing of note that is different to any other mass produced lager.

M - Light body with medium carbonation

O - Not worth the effort. This beer is just an ordinary lager with very little to warrant the extra layout."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.71,"Recently introduced to TJ's (at least here in San Diego), Red horse is a smooth malt liquor clocking in at a stout 8.0 ABV. Similar to Steel Reserve in strength, it's a bit smoother and possibly akin to Carlsberg Elephant. Good value at $4.49 for a four-back of 16.9 oz. talls, all served up in a cool can with horseshoe and chess knight motif. To the reviewer who complained about the venerable 'Trader carrying it? Don't like it, don't buy it, wuss!"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.18,extra strong crisp clean easy smooth to drink with little head that goes away and some carbanion to it overall a not bad beer when best served cold. at 8%
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,4.48,"Funny how I am reading many of the ratings for Red Horse. The first time I tried this beer I knew I finally found something that I would truly enjoy. This is truly a situation of ""to each his own."" I fell in love with Red Horse, the flavour for me is outstanding. I love the higher alcohol content as well as the fact that it is not filling, at least not to me. Loved it the first time I tried it. Not really a fan of lighter beers either. For me, this beer is a keeper and I just recently tried Hurricane, and it is very similar. Found another one that is a keeper for me. Enjoy and drink responsibly."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,1,"This is easily the worst beer i've had in my entire life. Reeks of a high gravity like hurricane/steel reserve but this turned my stomach. Bought this at a Trader Joe's, what the hell are they doing carrying something like this..?

Mouth feel: very carbonated
Overall: good beer for the hot weather in the Philippines, and not to get drunk since it is soda the most inexpensive way"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.75,"Finally an American Malt Liquor!
I know it's nothing to praise but still, as many legends grew around this type of beer I just had to drink it.
Looks a bit darker and intense than a pale lager but somehow you can tell that it's perhaps the coloring. The smell is also not that powerful and the taste also lacks the impression that makes a great beer - but it feels good to drink! As cheap as it is, as poor as it is, it is easy to drink and it is enjoyable.
That being said, I became even more interested in these malt liquors. Looking forward to drinking Mickey's Fine Malt Liquor and that Ol' English 800!"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.41,"From a bottle, pours as clear bubbling yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is very subtle, perhaps bread and corn. Flavor is a train wreck from the beginning. Although there are sweet malt flavors, it's just sad when corn, rice and metallic tastes are more prominent than things like ... well .. hops. Not sure the point of continuing, but OK, despite decent carbonation, the body is thin and unsatisfying."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.54,"330ml bottle from Chung Ying supermarket, Glasgow (£2.09):
Definitely a surprising beer & a lot better than I'd expected it to be without it being a must try or anything like that. It opened with a fairly light nose considering the strength of the beer & thankfully it wasn't an offensive or unpleasant aroma, I got some touches of corn & the odd adjunct coming through alongside a basic corn & lager malt body. The taste followed on in a similar vein with only the odd touch of alcohol grain coming through & the sweetness from the nose featuring here as well. It's not exactly a must try offering but it went down a lot better than I thought it would & it's not one that I'd run scared of were I to stumble across it again either."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.46,"Red Horse Extra Strong has a thin, quickly-dying white head, a clear, extremely bubbly, golden appearance, and no lacing left behind. The aroma is mild, but one can detect sweet malt and grain. Taste is also mild, for an 8% malt liquor- sweet malt, mild hop bitterness, and not cloying. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Red Horse finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.27,"Color: light yellow, clear. White foam melts very quickly.
Aroma: slightly floral, slightly malty and metallic.
Taste: malty note, a little wet cardboard or ""pharmacy"" and less clear metallicity.
High saturation, beer without a body."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.98,"Make way for one of the best of the worst strong beers on the commercial market. Imported straight from the dungeons of a strange Filipino brewery and right to your local liquor store, this beer trumps over stronger beers in it's class like Colt 45 and Labatt Blue Dry which clocks in at 8.1%. Red Horse lacks the obnoxious taste carried by the greaseball beer of choice, Colt 45 , and still manages to stand at an impressive 8% which you'll feel pretty quick. Sadly, I don't have the nose to detect a lot of the smells most of the other reviewers do. Taste does a fantastic job of hiding that alcohol taste and still manages to procure a good, stable taste which does not offend or cause projectile vomiting. My first experience with this was a 6pk purchased from a kindly Iranian couple's liquor store. Chuck in a few 2L wine coolers and some Counter Strike: Global Offensive and you end up with the terrorists winning and a killer hangover.

My second and perhaps last encounter with this bucking stallion was a mid-autumn day drink wherein we ended up inside the husk of a broken down combine/tractor wreck drinking Red Horse in 500ml cans and 6pks as well as some more 2L ciders and a few alcoholic energy drinks. The night ended with some Chinese take out prepared by a chef who won the 1983 Hong Kong Peking Cook Off. In short, Red Horse is a hell of beer that, for the ABV and taste, is a great choice for a wild night."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,2.99,"Ben drinking quite a few of these in a bamboo treehouse on the beach in Boracay, the Philippines. As a beer, it tastes a lot like a Budweiser with that same grainy sweetness but with a little bit more alcohol in there to add a bit more color to these island sunsets. Nothing special taste-wise, but when it is one of your 3 options (the others being San Miguel and San Miguel Light), it becomes a perfect pairing to this vacation."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.34,"I am drinking this cold, of course!
very pale, foam disappears immediately,
Pilsener malt, little continental hops, some booze
Very clean, mineraly, spicy hops are present, some booze
Thin, refreshing
Not a bad beer, surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV and the style.
One of the more drinkable pale strong lagers as it is not overly sweet. This beer is a real surprise for me. I expected so much worse."
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,4.5,"In the Philippines, this beer is delicious! Similar to a Budweiser but MUCH MORE FLAVOR. One of the best beers of this style I have tasted.
If purchased in the states, however, I was terribly let down. It isn't much better than a Budweiser in that case. I don't have the details why. Frankly, I don't care. It's just one more reason for me to visit the Philippines again. (y) I would guess though that the Philippines uses all natural/organic ingredients, and the Americans are stuck with the preservatives and toxins as usual.
FYI: At 8% alcohol, it kicks butts. You'll have a short night if you stick to these. :)"
Worst,Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,3.55,"I'm judging this in the context of its being a malt liquor, and—considering that generic fact—it's surprisingly tasty and well-executed. Compared to your Old-Es and King Cobras, the is exceedingly solid: sweet, but not sugary, with a strong malt-bite that succeeds without a heavy or excessively-thick body, which would undermine its adhenerence to the malt-liquor tenets. A bit of head, and minimal lacing, meets a malt-fruity, yeasty nose, all of which portends well; yet Red Horse tastes even better than those notes would suggest.

Again: it doesn't rank up with the greatest beers, but self-described ""malt liquors"" rarely do (shout-out to Three Floyds' Region Riot). This is imminently drinkable, however, which is more than can be said for Naty Ice or, say, Steel Reserve."
Worst,Cobra,2.84,"Bottle at Punjab, London, England

T: The taste has flavors of pilsener and sweet malts. There is a slight amount of bitterness.

Worst,Cobra,2.51,"Light orange colour, no carbonation, no foam. Weak sweet malt smell. Taste is sweet and watery and strangely reminiscent of apple juice. Refreshing, yet liveless and watery. If given the choice between this beer and Kingfisher, please take the latter. Please do."
Worst,Cobra,2.22,"Bottle: embossed 330mL brown label with a rubbish macro label.

Appearance: light golden in colour with a big bubbling head that dissipates quickly. Not flattering.

Aroma: light grains as expected from an adjunct, but with a light yet unmistakably thick off fug. Not a massively pleasant aroma.

Taste: cheap corn with more of that thick fug. Not much more to it.

Aftertaste: dissipates quickly, thankfully.

Mouth feel: thin body with big, bubbling carbonation. Kind of harsh.

Overall: not a brilliant beer, to be honest. Some vegetable and floral hop notes, but it is overpowered by an unpleasant and awkward funk."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.34,"Nothing nuanced about this beer, including the bottle art that no doubt will appeal to those young at heart. The color is not bad, sort of an orangish golden color, no real head or lacing. The smell is the weakest thing here, not sure what it is. The taste is simply boozy, and not a particularly pleasant booziness. Maybe a hint of anise. Anyway, not a repeater"
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.44,"Poured from a bottle. Orangish in color with almost no head. Smells of dark fruit, yeast and alcohol. Sting of alcohol, old fruit and leather in the flavor. Nothing much to be happy about here. Take a pass here"
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.2,"16.9 oz. bottle:

States on label - Beligian style and Quad Bock - Whatever that is supposed to mean:

Pours hazed to murky orange with a thin wispy head. Minimal lacing.

The smell is of overripe fruitiness (tough to pick out any individual fruits - just a fruity character in general). Boozed-soaked caramel comes through loud and clear.Maybe a subtle hint of cotton candy? (Maybe that's the ""Belgian"" part?)

The taste is something like sweet fruit punch with caramel. Raw alcohol is present in a malt liquor way. Harsh.

This is a rough one. Doesn't really fit a style - maybe a doppelbock - but close to a malt liquor/Euro strong lager hybrid. It's cheap and high in abv."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.04,"500ml bottle. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of booziness, caramel and toffee. So sweet and boozy. So hot."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.12,"Pours with virtually no head, has an orangish amber color. Not the best smelling beer, has a malty smell with an odor that is best decribed as over ripened fruit, most people would not find this appealing.

But when it comes to taste this seems to be ok for what it is, stronger beers like these are hard to find that are smooth or good tasting. Now this beer unfortunately is not an exception the taste is something along the line of over ripened apple, and there is definitely some alcohol burn with this one, not for everyone. Also very little carbonation. But definitely a bit better than most beers of this category. this is the type of beer you drink when you want to find your date more attractive. Defintately a kicker but worth a try if you like stronger beers, was found at not a bad price $2.00 for a pint at tone &country liquor on 47th and Richmond Chicago"

L: Pours a clear reddish orange without any discernible head.
S: Alcohol......and for lack of a better phrase, ""a rotting taffy apple"".
T: The 14% ABV hits you right upside the head and finishes with an unpleasant rotting fruit taste.
O: Without a doubt, one of the worst beers I've ever head. It's so bad that if I had a trip to Lithuania a planned, I'd cancel it."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.6,"Rinkuškiai ""Hell On High Quad Bock""
16.9 fl. oz brown glass bottle, coded ""L.10443""
$2.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Against my own better judgement having already had one of the strong beers from Rinkuškiai I'm going to go ahead and try ""Hell On High"". At least the label is good with a devilish looking character petting a white poodle. So, even with a rough pour I was unable to bring up a head. There's a little bubbly foam here and there but not much. That really hurts it in terms of appearance. The body is a very hazy deep amber with an orange sheen and golden highlights. The aroma is malty and caramelish with a light bit of apple-like fruitiness. The flavor follows and I'm quite surprised, it's much better than I thought it would be. The rich caramel maltiness is pleasant and not overdone, and there are no off-flavors. The alcohol does show slightly but I think it's actually helping to dry it in the finish along with its median bitterness, some herbal hops, and refreshing apple-like fruitiness. It could be a more carbonated but it's not bad, it works well with the full bodied maltiness. I'm going to guess it's around 2.0 volumes of CO2 where a standard beer is around 2.5 and a cask ale is more like 1.8. I keep smelling it, swirling it, waiting to find something bad come out as it warms but it hasn't happened yet. However, more and more alcohol is showing but we'll see if all of that malt keeps it in balance ... ... ... hmm, it's stayed pretty much the same except that it has lost some carbonation which leaves it even softer, and that hurts it on mouthfeel despite it's chewy maltiness. The bottle label did say it was bottle conditioned but I highly doubt that, and even if it was, it's hard to coax enough carbonation out at 14% ABV. So, what to say? It's perfect for malt heads, and those who just love strong beers. For anyone else it's more like a golden caramel flavored dessert beer, and even in that it's pretty one-sided. I'm surprised it's as clean as it is, and so not-hot with alcohol, but that's not enough to pull it beyond a decent beer despite it's ""quad bock"" status."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.52,"We gotta call it for what it is. This is kind of an over-ABV joke label from Lithuania.
a) Flat dark whiskey body, no head, nothing on top (fail).
s) absolutely fine, with sweet fruit predominant, alcohol laden, fruit cake, cider, b&b.
t) The taste follows nose but more complex, and nuanced with sweetness, whiskey soaked fruit, fruit cake, tempered by smokey malt and grain backbone, again whiskey like. A bit harsh after a few sips. (perhaps a good cooking liquid?)
f) Sharp, cloying, not crisp, on the thicker side w very low amount of carbonation.
o) Sub-par overall. too sweet, too harsh."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.78,"Appearance: cloudy orange color with a few surface bubbles as a head.

Smell: over ripe golden apples and alcohol are most notable and unappealing.

Taste: grainy malt base with honey, over ripe apples, pears, and lots of warming alcohol.

Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Smooth from start to finish. Long lasting sweet and burning aftertaste.

Overall: this beer is way too sweet with a rancid apple flavor with loads of alcohol burn. Not for me."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,3.17,"This unique brew was enjoyed from the bottle in a snifter. Pouring a very nice
clear and bright amber this beast produces a thin ring and subtle pool with very
light lacing. Nose of heavy apple cider, light brown sugars, and strong grain alcohol.
Flavors follow the nose with brown sugars and golden raisins awash in apple cider
and beaten to death by strong warming grain booze. Decent mouth feel, warming and
lightly coating. Let it warm and be lightly rewarded, yet know that the strength of the
grains and booze increase as well beating you over the head with strong booze.

Decent but a touch over the top without enough depth.

Cheers"
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.98,"If there was a beer equivalent to getting punched in the head this would be it. It tastes extremely grainy smells as dank as it tastes. That being said, I love this ish. For a 14% beer it is still comparatively drinkable.

Give this to your buddy if you want to here him talk about his divorce for two hours."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.94,"From the bottle, it pours amber with virtually no head. Somewhat malty aroma - lots of grain? Alcohol and some grainy malt in the mouth. This beer hits you like a freight train!"

Buckle your seat belts, its going to be a bumpy ride. Orange golden body with small creamy head. Musty malty aroma, somewhat funky. Doubting the doppelbock classification here. Malt liquor, strong lager, etc... Taste is also pure sweet malt, corn, cooked vegetables. Slick, slippery body, no finish, just heat."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.43,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellowish amber in color and has a light amount of carbonation. It poured with a short white head that quickly died down, leaving only a thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.

T: The taste is quite sweet and malty, having lots of flavors of apples, brown bread, caramel, and raisins along hints of alcohol.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. No stickiness is perceptible.
O: For a 14% abv beer, this does a good job at hiding most of the alcohol from the taste, although the flavors can seem more like fruits that were soaked in alcohol. The taste also seems to be somewhat rancid, which impacts the drinkability more than the alcohol does.

Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.83,"This thing was awful! Initial aromas of apple, corn syrup and alcohol. It was mostly yeast and sugar as it reached room temperature. Taste was too sweet with a nasty metallic aftertaste. Highly carbonated. Nasty! Only fans of fourloko would enjoy this nasty liquid. Don't be swayed by the $2.19 price tag and 14% abv. No bueno!"
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,1.42,"I found this single 16.9oz bottle at Springbrook Liquors in Bloomingdal, ILe for $2.69. Cool name and nice looking label, but that's the only cool thing about this beer.

The beer poured a cloudy honey gold color with a 2½-finger dish soap looking white head that lasted a little over a minute but left no lacing whatsoever.

The beer had only one smell - that of mild caramel.

Yuk! This is total drain pour. It tastes like hard rock candy dipped in caramel and then re-dipped and soaked in alcohol. Absolutely horrid.

Disgustingly sweet and alcoholic with zero carbonation.

I'd like to meet the brew master of this stuff so I could tear up his brewing license and punch him in the mouth for passing this vile stuff off as beer."
Worst,Hell On High Quad Bock,2.95,"I picked up a bottle of Rinkuskiai's Hell On High Quad Bock a couple weeks ago for $4.69 at The Beer Depot. This beer really caught my eye and It's been a while since I've tried one of these crazy Lithuanian beers, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle poured into a teku.

A- The label is awesome, it goes great with name and it's really eye catching. It poured a nice orange color that took on more of an amber color with just a small ring of head that quickly faded away and it didn't leave any lacing behind. This beer looks ok, but it would be nice if it had some head and lacing.

S- The aroma starts off with a high amount of sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart lots of sweet malts, caramel malts, apple juice and raisin like aromas with a little bit of a brown bread aromas also showing up. Up next comes the alcohol which is pretty noticeable and it's followed by a little more sweetness. The aroma is ok, but it's very sweet.

T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a high amount of sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in aroma with the all the aspects seeming to show up pretty evenly. Up next comes the alcohol which is pretty noticeable, but it's not as boozy and warming as I was expecting. On the finish there's more sweetness with a candied aftertaste. This taste was Ok, I was expecting a little more flavor, but at least it's not super boozy.

M- Not smooth, cloying, not crisp, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a low amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel isn't that great and I wish it had some more carbonation.

Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was an average example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I expect from these high alcohol bocks, but in the end it seemed to be lacking on the flavor. This beer didn't have great drinkability, one glass is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer was the label it was awesome. What I like the least about this beer was the high sweetness and the lack of carbonation. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but it isn't something I feel the need to revisit. It's worth a try if you like these strong bocks, but I can't say I recommend it. All in all it's not bad and it's not as boozy as I was expecting, but I wish it had some flavor to it. It made for an ok first impression for this brewery and it's average for the style. Nice job guys, but a little more carbonation and less sweetness wouldn't hurt."
Worst,Genesee NA,2.4,"Picked this up for when I have to drive. Nice carbonation, good thirst quencher. Not much depth on flavor, very shallow. Good tho for when you can't drink alcohol. Better than water."
Worst,Genesee NA,2.81,"Genesee NA brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. This Non Alcoholic brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a small white head. The non alcoholic brew has an ABV of less than 0.5% Genesee NA has a beer smell to it. You pick up on a hit of grains and malts. There is a slight sweetness to the smell of this brew. Not a whole lot to write home about, but it is what it is. Now for the taste is light and watery. You pick up on faint notes of grins and malts. For what it worth this is a nice clean crisp drinking brew. Has the mouth feel of water. Now I giving this non alcoholic brew a honest review. I have tried other non alcoholic brews on the market and for the most part they are all the same. This one lacks flavor. I thought there honestly would be more to this brew. However I would buy this brew again to charge it up a bit. If you are looking for a non alcoholic brew with flavor this is not it. Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co., Did a decent job with this brew.
I will give it this it is a refreshing brew.
Overall I'm giving Genesee NA , a 3 out of 5. Not the best NA brew I have had but not the worst."
Worst,Genesee NA,2,"A-Pours a straw color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has slight malt hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a slight malt flavor
M-A light bodied well carbonated beer
O-A decent beer"
Worst,Genesee NA,1.34,"12oz can (no date code) into Dartington ultimate lager glass. 2 finger white head goes to a little ring around the edges quickly. A few minor spots of foam cling to the glass as it's drunk down. Sparklingly clear straw yellow color.

Aroma is hint of grassy rubberyness. Taste is water with a tinge of corn and lightly sweet cornflakes breakfast cereal. Carbonation was low to medium low.

Finishes starting lightly sweet then the taste of tap water. No body at all, pure wateryness. Like drinking a low sugar watery soda or taking a poor pale lager and watering it down with semi-flat seltzer water.

I got an itch to try some non-alcoholic beers, and when I saw this at the market for $2.99/sixer, I figured for that low a price, how could I lose? After drinking this, I feel like I totally wasted $2.99!"
Worst,Genesee NA,2.14,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with no head to speak of. Smell was also virtually non-existent, a hint of grains. Taste was also weak, to put it mildly. A bit metalllic, slight bitterness. Feels watery in the mouth and has average drinkability. Maybe it is just this style, but I didn't enjoy this beer at all."
Worst,Genesee NA,3.46,"This should have been part of The CANQuest (TM) just past 300 reviews, but I could (past tense of CAN) not lay hands on it. Many thanks to tone77 for his CANtinuous CANtributions in support of this madness.

I had an initial pour of just under a finger's worth of bubbling, bone-white head that tried to reduce to wisps but could not quite achieve it. Instead, I got a film of head that CANtinued to bubble and burble away. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me of an adjunct lager in terms of its inherent honey and grain-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was much too thin to be of any merit. Way watery and I CANnot forgive that! Still, it had a light sweetness, lager-like, albeit muted. Finish was pleasant, slightly refreshing, worth drinking, if you are in the mood for an N. A. beer, as my uncle was this past Saturday, then this has to rank up there, in my book, for the style. Put this in your cooler for the people who request such things."
Worst,Genesee NA,2.05,"From can no. 0610-R-10:25. Sampled on May 23, 2010. About the only thing you can say about NA or LA beers is that they moisten your throat on a hot day. Pale straw colored pour followed with quickly dissolving fizzy white head and no lacing. The aroma is like malt-flavored water and the taste is a bit more grainy but also very much like malt-flavored water. Thin mouthfeel. There is not much else to say about it."
Worst,Genesee NA,2.18,"Ok, I'm going to explain why I review low-alcohol beer. I've always been under the impression that beer with no alcohol is basically malty water and tasteless. So, even though I have hope that there will be non-alcoholic beer that has a bit of flavor, I really don't think such a thing exists.

Pours a light golden color with a one-finger head and what appears to be ample carbonation into my glass.

Aroma is sweet and grainy and not much else. Seems about right for the style.

Taste is light, sweet and grainy. Seems rather rough in the middle and fades to nearly nothing in the back.

Mouthfeel is the same I guess. Lingering sweetness, graininess and etc, etc.

Not as offensive as I thought it would be. Less of the ""ginger ale"" taste and more of the malty, grainy beer flavor. I suppose you could enjoy this more than a few other NA beers that I've reviewed."
Worst,Genesee NA,1.47,"Appearance: Clear, yellow body with a thin, bubbly, white head.

Smell: Light pale malt and corn with the scent of a filthy dog's mouth equally filthy mouth. Bleh.

Taste: Light pale malts with some corn husks stirred in. Very unclean. They scrubbed out the alcohol and replaced it with, well, I don't know, but it's all kinds of awful. Like a dog belched up something awful in the brew prior to canning.

Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Terrible! Some of these NA beers can be quite ghastly. And needlessly so!"
Worst,Genesee NA,1.2,From a 12oz can - Pours a clear light pale yellow. Not pretty at all. Smells exactly like an ashtray or cigar smoke. Worst smelling beer ever! Below average carbonation. First sip is almost flavorless with just a tad of hops and malts ...almost water like. I can not imagine consuming this product.
Worst,Genesee NA,1.63,"Genesee NA pours a very pale straw color with a thick fluffy white head from a twelve ounce can. Doesn't smell very good, a bit sulfury. Well, I really want to say it hardly tastes like anything. Maybe a slight sour flavor, and some leftover chemical flavor. Not recommended."
Worst,Genesee NA,2.15,"Pouered a pale yellow with large white puffy head that quickly faded. Smell is so minmal as to almost non-existent, with maybe a slight sweetness present. Taste is also very minimal with a starnge sweetish texture. Finish is somewhat unpleasant. There are much better NA's avaliable."
Worst,Genesee NA,1.38,"It is with extreme displeasure that I rated this ""beverage"". It was 4.49 for a 12 and I'm wondering what to do with the other 10. Maybe I can use them as paperweights?

It's light looking, it has almost no smell, in the mouth it feels like any other beer beverage, but that's the good part. It's flavorless. Oh, there is a little taste, kind of like drinking a sour-tasting soda water. I kept swigging/swishing/hoping something would come around to my palette but other than a slight can taste, NOTHING. I'm only trying the NAs so I'd have something to drink on New Years, but YIKES.

I tried mixing this with a shot of liquor, and two sips later , down the sink it went. Steer clear of this ""brew"" unless soda water that tastes metallic and a little sour is your thing. Go with Old Milwaukee NA, at least that resembles beer!"
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.09,"16 oz. Can poured into mason jar
Look: one and a half finger head does not stay long, golden color. Good lacing.
Smell: Malt with hints of sweetness.
Taste: Medium bitterness, not extraordinary, not bad. Finish is ok.
Feel: Nice carbonation, stays on tongue after swallowing.
Overall: I could take it or leave it. I would not seek it out if there were others of the style.
Pair with seafood."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.51,"24oz can, date code SEP2721. Poured into a pint glass.

A - pours a clear yellow with a thin white head that leaves a little bit of lacing. Head retention is fair; lots of small bubbles rising through the glass.

S - Primarily malts and adjuncts; there's a bandage-like funk that shows up near the end of the nose that's a bit off-putting.

T - Malty with a caramel-like sweetness; no discernable hop character. The funk present on the nose doesn't reveal itself in the taste.

M - Medium-bodied with average carbonation and a smooth, sweet finish. Drinkability is good, provided it stays cold.

O - For a regular strength ML (5.9%) it's serviceable, but better options exist. YMMV."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.82,"I have one idea what it looks like, drank it straight from the can after fishing it from an iced down communal beer cooler in the middle of a Pakistani Valero at IH-10 and Fry are. on the outskirts of Houston.
It was, as you might have guessed, ice cold. I only detected a sulphurous, slightly putrid smell. The taste is as slightly sweet, artificial grape drink (drank) (purple), slight alcohol warmth. It tastes a lot like, despair. I’m so glad I only had 16 oz to drink.
It will get the job done if you want a buzz, but there’s much better ways to achieve that for the same price."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.68,"(16 oz can, DEC0919; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip)

L: brilliantly-clear, pale yellow-amber liquid; tall, semi-tight, silky white foam builds high, slow crumble... thin collar remains, a few islands of suds as well; some lace, but much of it slides away

S: dried apple, hint of white grape atop a powdered-donut doughy malt base; soft clove spice, subtle cookie-ish baked grain note... no one element really stands out, fair-moderate potency... malt fades in favor of spice and dried pomme

T: expected a little more base sweetness upon first sip, but it's merely a mellow, white-bready, dry malt foundation; the spice is even rather subdued, lingering with a delicate boost of booze in the aftertaste... taste gets more muddy as it goes; bit of a medicinal alcohol builds in the back halfway through; slight nutty yeast aftertaste by the end

F: satiny smooth, little afterburn... arguably a tad watery in the finish; arguably needs a lil more heat; otherwise dream drag and drop

O: last saw this summer 2015, but failed to pull the trigger - been looking for it since... an open-minded venture into an anecdotally seedy dive bar in my buddy's town reaped its reward, of sorts (basically just the review)... disappointingly a little too bland of a taste, but fantastically drinkable (1518)"
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.11,"First impression:

D / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
07/08/19 can:

A bit sweet and a biteen syrupy but not as off putting as many budget malt liquors. Corn, 6-row, cooked grain. Has a warm alcohol undertone that's unpleasant but not intolerable.

No overt hop flavours are present to any extent. Not metallic or otherwise off.

Unrefreshing but drinkable. I've had worse student tipples in my day. Wouldn't be a repeat buy with Mickey's on the market...

D+ / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3,"To me, the king of Malt Liquors. Overall I would rate it as average, because there are none from this category I would consider outstanding. Is a sweet smelling and tasting brew, light bodied but extremely poundable. Let's be honest, if your drinking ml's you're not looking for sipping brews."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.62,"L: Thick head, decent lacing, deep golden color.

S: Sweet malt and corn. Fairly weak.

T: Very sweet, basically no hops, inoffensive but not very rich or grainy.

F: Medium bodied with very clean finish. Not as carbonated as the X.L. Schlitz malt liquor (Red bull)

Overall: You could do worse than this one but it's not even better than OE 800. I like the Red Bull X.L. Schlitz better as it is not as sweet. A middle of the road malt liquor that is worth a try but not worth going out of your way for."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),4.94,"This economy Beer is a major contender with top notch brews. For the price, I recommend you skip pabst, miller and coors. Go for the Bull. The look is super clear, light straw in appearance. The presentation of the can is fair. Since this is a economic Beer, I suppose the design is not bad. The nose is sweet and yeasty with some slight spoiled grain smell. Meh, the smell is boring. For flavor, this is not exceptional but very similar to Miller high life. Top end sweetness with faint yeast/white bread notes, quickly goes into some maltiness and hop bitterness in the middle. The finish is a little wet. I really enjoyed the body of this beer. Good sting carbonation that pricks your pallet with a fantastic creamy texture as it goes down. Very nice medium body. As you drink, the hops and ethyl acetate build up on your pallet, rendering your taste buds useless. I believe Schlitz malt liquor tastes much better than Miller high life due to the fact high life has a thin body and a overwhelming canned vegetable taste. This beer has none of that! If you are looking for something with more flavor and more alcohol hit, I recommend this beer!"
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.67,"Pours a clear bright golden yellow with medium head.
Smell is pretty light corn and grain.
Taste is sweet malt, grain, and a hint of apple in the finish.
Better than expected."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.1,"One of the better Malt Liquors out there, and I have tried about all of them. I remember the old commercial ""don't say beer, say bull."" If I want a little ""boost"" during an afternoon of draining cans, I generally alternate the bull and whatever aal is in the fridge at the time. Not wonderful, but it does the job, and I have never sputtered in disgust when taking a sip/chug of one of these. Then again, I don't ask for much. Between all of the smoking I did in my younger days (thankfully behind me) and all of the spicy foods I like now, my taste buds may be sub-par. Good for me, 'cause I will drink about anything."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.7,"The Stroh Brewing Co. ""Schlitz Malt Liquor""
32 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, coded ""JUL0317..."" and sample on 2 October 2017
$2.76 @ New Stop Discount Liquor Outlet, Camden, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Risking life and limb in Camden, NJ (currently #10 in the country for murders) I picked up a 32 oz. bottle of Schlitz Malt Liquor. It wasn't until after I left that I realized I'd screwed up. I thought to myself, ""Damn, you was supposed to get a 40!"". Oh well. It's got a fingerprint-through-the-glass clarity in a light straw gold body beneath a foamy then creamy white head that holds surprisingly well and leaves some very nice lacing behind. What is going on? And there are also some hops found in the aroma - not just background hops, but clear hops along with sweetish golden malt. I must be having a very good ""nose day"" because I don't remember ever having a malt liquor that smelled of hops. I'd say they're floral and a bit herbal. There's also some fruit there as well, apple-like. Ahhh, and yes, that carries over into the flavor, there's a clear note of juicy red apple amidst the sweetish malt and hops. Keep in mind, these hops are not to the strength that most craft beer drinkers will think of, but they're there nonetheless. I was just about to say that there are also no off-notes, aromas or flavors due to a high fermentation but as I'm looking at the bottle I see that it's only 5.9% ABV - that explains a lot. Budweiser is currently 5.0% so it's not really that much higher. There's just a light hint of extra alcohol that actually works with the slight bit of extra malt. It's not bad, and in fact, it's pretty good - at least for a malt liquor. So let's sum up so far. It's got surprisingly good head retention and it leaves very nice lacing, and the aroma is nice. There's a hint of alcohol that I didn't find at first but it's not bad at all; and the flavor is very well balanced as well. Could it be a touch more bitter to balance the malt and give a drier finish? Perhaps, but this is a malt liquor which is supposed to be a little sweet. It's medium bodied and moderately crisp, which accentuates it's sweetish adjunct-laden golden maltiness but still it's smooth and quite nice - I'll give it a 3.5 as I think it could be a little crisper, but then again, I have to keep in mind that this is an American malt liquor and it's supposed to be more malty and smooth. Hmmm, I don't know, maybe it should get a 3.75 for being to style. So, the only thing left to judge it on is it's overall character, and in that regard I originally thought that it was one of the best malt liquors I'd ever tasted, and the fact that it had some hops and very nice lacing was a huge bonus."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),1.65,"Hard to drink an entire 40 compared to OE, my go-to. There is a faint sweetness that tastes artificial, like corn syrup. Paired with the high-gravity flavor and the blue bull design, I feel like I'm drinking a terrible mix drink. It was on sale at my bodega though, so I bought it a few times."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),3.02,"Malty and bold taste, which at least is more interesting than AAL's. Slightly bitter. In college we had SML on ice with a twist of lemon, called it a Schlitz Twist. It vastly improved it, and was great on a hot summer day. But - we would drink anything back then..."
Worst,Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),2.51,A decent malt liquor. Bought at some hole in the wall liquor store near St. Louis on my way to Lake Timberline. Poured a golden straw color with a head that didn't stick around too long. Aroma was corn with a whiff of booze. Can't seem to find it here in Massachusetts.
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.03,"Poured from a 32oz bottle best by Apr 2023

On the pour a 3 finger white head forms with some light fizziness. After a while the head dissipates to a more fizzy rocky 1 finger head. Fine plentiful carbonation in a golden yellow body. For the style head retention is pretty nice.

Aroma is old and almost skunky in the hops. Corn is present and lager character is quite present. A very ""mexican"" import aroma. Despite that it is full bodied while maintaining a lighter and refreshing presence. High carbonation while still being quite smooth and a nice dinner beer.

Overall this is pretty good, but there are a few off notes, traditional cervesa corny flavors and a bit of that corona like skunk, but a bit more rich and sweet than a lot of light Mexican beers.

Taste is light and ""cervesa"" like with the skunky off note gone on the palate almost entirely until there is a faint note of it on the very end. The main flavor of this is corny crackery malts with a slight sweetness. This beer is not very bitter but would be quite good on a beach with canitas tacos and lime.

Feel is bigger than a lot of other pale Mexican lagers. Decently long finish from the malt and somewhat full bodied while maintaining"
Worst,Carta Blanca,2.14,I had this beer with some pasole at Gabriel’s near Santa Fe. Poured from a bottle into a tall half pint glass. Clear yellow color with a good white head with decent lacing. Faint hint of corn in the smell and taste. A bit of citrus. Not much taste overall. Just thought I would give it a try.
Worst,Carta Blanca,2,"This is like the miller of Mexico. Miller light. It's definitely corny, slightly sweet, much lighter than you would expect. I mean that's all there is to say. Without the import markup it would be right next to the cans of light and ice beer we know and love. It's fun to explore new stuff that rolls in to the gas station, but if it's rollin in there I really shoulda known better"
Worst,Carta Blanca,5,"8 oit of 10 STARS. DOES anybody like DON CHELADA CUPS!?!?!?Ñ?!?!?
They are the best COMBO EVER IN THE WORLD!! I was PTAINET (PATIENT)(""& Lord and behold"") it was the best thing I drink and The only Vice I wish I had... Lol J.K. i'm Chicano & Love this CÈRVEZA with the deepest depths of my heart to be honest!"
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.22,"Drank from the bottle, so to be honest, can't really give informed opinion about appearance and to a lesser degree aroma. Most AAL's have similar look, had a tinge of citrus flavor, smooth feel to it, easy drinking. Middle of the road beer."
Worst,Carta Blanca,2.03,"L: Pours straw yellow with a bitchin two finger white head.
S: Sweet-grains, malts, hay barn funkiness.
T: Taste follows the nose, has a sour flavor to it that is just kinda strange.
F: Light-bodied, semi-dry, crisp, refreshing.
O: It's not horrible, certainly can session on these, just not my first choice."
Worst,Carta Blanca,2.91,"I am pleasantly surprised that this is as decent as it is. Not a great beer by any means, but it is something I would not complain about too much if it was the only beer available at a hot summer event. The flavor is a bit bland, but not bad. A bit of a funky aftertaste but nothing that would ruin your drinking experience."
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.62,"The best mexican beer I have tasted. Light and crisp not too filling, not a strong flavor and lacks character but still very drinkable if you add a lemon, lime or clementine."
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.87,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep golden or light orange color. An appropriate white head. A touch darker than your average lager. but pretty average SRM of 8. (3.75)

Aroma: Light aromas. Some dry pale white cracker and bread dough. Some seawater. A touch of grass. Then some light fresh paint phenols from the yeast. (3.50)

Flavor: Light flavors of dry flaked biscuit and cracker. Some ground stone and mortar. Hints of grass. Some yeast allows it to finish very dry and clean. (4.00)

Feel: Medium to light bodied. Great carbonation and yeast. Very sudsy and clean. The carbonation and yeast clean the palate well to leave just enough sweetness on the palate. Well-constructed mouthfeel. Hits the mark for a lager. (4.00)

Compared with Warsteiner Pilsner: Similar appearance, a slightly sweeter aroma and flavor. Much more German biscuit and yeast. Less lemon and grass. A much more salty, sudsy, biscuit and yeast profile.

Compared with Peter's Brand: Similar flavor. More light yeast and stronger carbonation to provide a bump, rather than a twangy malt body.

Compared w/ Dos Equis 3/27/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. Less aromas. More dry ground flaked cracker and stone mortar. Less corn and sweetness. Overall, lighter, dryer, and more yeast.

Overall: *Impressed by this one. Great German biscuit flavors, yet the body is right on for a lager to make it finish clean. The flavor and body are just right. I would rank this among some of the best Mexican lagers*
**Very different from my first review which shows huge German biscuit flavors in which I gave it a 4.22. It's very dry, clean and light. Sudsy and well carbonated.** (Final Rating: 3.87)"
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.53,"(12 oz bottle, no date; purchased single off shelf... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: clear, golden-amber liquid, bit of speckled sediment; soft, spongy foam on pour - did not immediately disintegrate... thin smatter of lacy lace at the top

S: toasted caramel malt, pretzel-like baked grain character; golden-brown bread crust overtone for sure... after a few secs, bit of a clove phenol edging out... malt liquor aromas - just a bit... vaguely German coloring?

T: hit of band aid, then pretzel, then a combo of both, with a finish of bubblegum that swells up in the aftertaste - one of the most baseball-card-pack, spicy bubblegum notes in memory from a junk lager, taking me back, wow... bit of an apple-y, white grape fruit-skin note springs up by the second sip... clove-y bubblegum quietly hums after a few moments, lingering, along with a mildly toasty, granola note... relatively bold malt foundation, mild-moderate earthy bitter bite with a rusted metallic back end - those both take over midway through

F: lively sudsy activity; tapered, lean malt body... clings a little going through, but slinks away ok; relatively dry bottom

O: cerveza it is, but a bit mixed-up, drawing perhaps from too many disciplines... marginally more robust compared to the similar Corona Familiar I had earlier... a head-scratcher; good things going on, but would only get again in a moment of spontaneity (1459)"
Worst,Carta Blanca,3.18,"From the bottle, it pours a clear yellow gold with a modest white head that lasts a bit. In the nose, it is light grain. In the mouth, it is the same. Drinkable."
Worst,Carta Blanca,4.68,"Of all the Mexican beers this is my favorite. I have no scientific basis for this statement-- other Mexican beers taste like they come from some hot musty Mexican factory, however Carta Blanca beer could pass for an American or German beer any day. Smooth, crisp and consistently crafted. No lime needed."
Worst,XXXX Bitter,2.99,"A solid macro lager. L. Light gold with frothy, white head that fades quickly to lacing. Not much retention. S. Slight grain, but not much. T. Similar, light grain with a dry finish, a touch of astringency from the high carbonation. Can have a metallic tang, so I have always avoided drinking from cans. F. Light, a touch fizzy and the carbonation can have an astringent effect. O. I grew up on this stuff, it so dominated the Queensland beer market in the 1970s and 80s. So I have a soft spot for this beer and served cold it is an acceptable thirst quencher in the Queensland heat."
Worst,XXXX Bitter,5,The epitome of brewing. This fine Qld lager is the best to come out of Australia. Fond memories of the grain and hop scents rolling through the grassy hills of Milton and Auchenflower. I'm salivating while I reminisce.
Worst,XXXX Bitter,1.5,"I supposed the Bitter means English pale ale but it is not. We have this kind of adjuncts everywhere, and this one isn't any better than others nor cheaper."
Worst,XXXX Bitter,1.63,"Had at the recommendation of a waiter in Brisbane. He should be fed to a crocodile.

Pours golden with a slim white head. Retention is fine. Decent amount of carbonation rising.

Aroma is unassuming.

Taste is of adjuncts. Quite offensive.

Mouthfeel is a bubbly mess. Light bodied.

Overall, don't bother with this one. It is popular, so I'm assuming that is why it was recommended...but not all things that are popular are good."
Worst,XXXX Bitter,4.45,"This is my beer of choice for a good session. It has a bad rep that is not deserved.
(For some reason it is not cool to drink XXXX in Australia)

If I was at a bar to have 1 beer I would pick a beer with more flavours in the palate.
When I want to drink 12+ beers I choose to drink XXXX.

The beer has a lot of carbonation and must be consumed cold.

It is the most refreshing beer I know. More exotic beers will cause bloat/tiredness after a couple but XXXX can be consumed in large quantities without taste or thirst fatigue.

The hangover is light compared to other drinks. No headache or nausea. Only laziness and a mild resentment towards other people and the world in general."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),2.68,"Poured a clear golden yellow color with a light white head. It had as a very mild flavor that is not too bad. A little too much carbonation but overall, it's a refreshing summer beer for those hot and humid days."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.1,"Sampled multiple times from 1981 onwards. A typical commercial American pale lager, quite refreshing and better than it’s reputation, after all. Contains some rice. Tasted good in the heat of a Californian summer, but when I had it again in Norway, the magic was gone."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.04,"Pours a clear golden straw color. The head is two fingers high and white in shade; retention is pretty damn poor. The aroma offers a nice (yet subtle) hit of grassy hops, backed by the sweet malt backbone. Simple, yet effective. It seems to taste a little sweeter than the nose indicated, but only just a little bit. There's a touch of darker malt character to this beyond the classic white bread and cracker notes coming from pale malts; touches of toasted bread and nut comes through. The finish has enough hoppiness to cleanse the palate, no more and no less. It also seems to be a little buttery on the back end, maybe even a touch grainy. This is one of the few beers I've sampled that I can truly call bone dry. It manages this without being ridiculously over-carbonated. The dryness helps counteract the decently full body, though it does seem slightly astringent at times. Look, I know it's a 64, and that sucks. And while I definitely wanted a little more from this, it's not really BAD. It just isn't all that great. But hey, it's cheap, and better than Budweiser (and FAR better than Michelob Ultra). In the right place and right time, that's all that matters. There are other cheaper lagers I'd take over this, but it'll get the job done in a pinch."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.27,"Poured into a pilsner glass

L; 3.25. Nice coloration but the carbonation leaves much to be desired. Thin head.
S: 3.75. Barley. Spicy German hops. Light on adjuncts, Corn.
T: 3. Quite malty. Barley. Corn. Light bitterness from hops.
F: 3.25. Medium bodied. A bit heavy for a lager.
O: 3.25. This is a go-to. Not too expensive and the quality is pretty good. One of the better American lagers."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.34,"Found some 6 packs of 12 oz bottles with twist offs
The pour revealed a crystal clear american lager whaddaya know. Head isnt all that fine and dissapeared as quick as it was poured. Visually cant differentiate between any other macros, except that its darker than light beers.

The smell has a strong corn aroma but hops do shine through unlike other macros which is a nice surprise. My sense of smell still isnt 100% here though. Almost smells like a grainy pils.

Flavor is even better than the smell. Bitterness from noble hops is obvious and appreciated with much of the grain covered by them while cold. Surprisingly dry for a macro full flavor. Quite nice for when you dont want something heavy but also not grossly sweet and grainy, but also dont want to shell out for a german import.

Feel is actually very refreshing the strong carbonation combines with the bitterness of the hops to create a refreshing experience with just enough grain sweetness to balance it out but not weigh it down.

Overall, one of the best cheap beers ice had, idk why irs rated so low here, for the style and brewery it's actually quite good. If you see it and havent tried it but like lagers, I'd pick it up, maybe if enough people buy it we can give it a new lease on life."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),2.81,"A vigorous pour produces a tightly packed white head that quickly recedes to nothingness, no lacing is left on the glass. Some bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass, but otherwise it looks like apple juice. The smell is of malts with some bittering hops. The taste is ok, there are no off flavors and the balance of malt and hops produces a decent bitterness that's correct for the style and the beer, but it's nothing special. The mouthfeel is not good, there is a prickly carbonation that can be a bit much especially if you have more than one."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.61,"Haven't had one since the ABInBev buyout. It's got that sour finish you'd associate with Bud or Coors, but at this point it's somewhere in between. It used to be smoother. Sad ending for what used to be a great lager, but glad there's still a lager coming from AB that's not brewed from rice. Bring back the old recipe and the old bottles, and I'll gladly pay more for it."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.69,"lost carbonation with the twist-off cap, otherwise this is damned tasty! i havent seen one of these in over ten years or more! low scores due to the weak carbonation. but it tastes great!"
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.12,"12oz gold can - review from notes

I actually really like this one... well, it's alright. Sorta skunky, but with a great beer hiding in there. I wish I had this 30 years ago before the recipe changed, I bet it was amazing. As it stands, this is still above average for an American adjunct

Solid stuff"
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.85,"I first began drinking Michelob in high school. It was usually Busch and Budweiser, but we got Michelob for special occasions, such a dates. I like IPAs, Scotch Ales, Doppelbocks, and Belgian ales. But I have no problem drinking pale lagers. And as far as American pale lagers go, this is just great. I'm amused at the low scores and critical reviews saying there's no flavor, or it's like drinking water. These reviews are just beer snobs and their bias against ""big beer"", especially Anheuser-Busch. I did a blind tasted test involving Michelob, Hofbrau, and some others pale lagers. Michelob was not more watery than any of the others. And I could barely tell the difference between Michelob and the Munich helles lagers I tried."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.71,This might be the best american lager i've tried. A truly hidden gem. Just the right amount of maltyness and hop balance. One of the cleanest tasting beers i've had period. This is pretty much my go-to everyday beer now. You owe it to yourself to seek this out and try it at least once.
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),2.81,"Still readily available in my area. 12 oz bottle, aggressive pour leaves 4 finger head. Not much lacing, but some. Smells a bit sour, maybe the yeast is imparting that. It is what it is. Best compliment i would give it is that its clean. Thats about it."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),2,"Neutered of most taste, Michelob is essentially like drinking water from your tap in a large metro area. Slightly acidic, and boring. There are better macro American Lagers for sure."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.96,Remember my dad’s fridge being stocked with michelob teardrop bottles in the mid 80’s . Stands toe to toe with any of the German lagers out there. AB needs to market this and bring back those shorty teardrop bottles with the gold top. If you enjoy a craft lager look no further. Great maltiness with grassy hop note on the finish . Pleasant lingering taste keeps you coming back for more . AB’s hidden gem .
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.76,"Since Michelob Lager may not be around much longer, (May already be discontinued) does anyone have a recommendation that tastes similar to the great beer? This has been my beer since 1979. I drink other beers with meals or at gatherings. My beer for the taste and aroma alone has been Michelob Lager. Nothing tastes better and goes down smoother with just the right lingering after taste. I’m gonna miss this beer and Budweiser is not even close."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.78,"Yellow colored, with hint of gold hue. Aroma was, pleasant, bit of bread/malt mix. Taste was better than I remembered from 20 years ago. Just a slight metalic aftertaste. Pleasantly enjoyable. Not wide!y available but found a 12 pk bottles for $14.99 + tax."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),3.62,"12oz bottle coded 20069 (3/9/20) poured into a pilsner glass at fridge temp 4.8% ABV per label. The beer pours bright golden straw yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin ring. Minimal lacing. The aroma is faint with with vague grain, dusty dried grass and a hint of floral hops. The taste is yeasty with pale malt and moderate bitterness throughout. Mild dusty, dry, earthy hop flavors. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with just above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Fairly clean lagering. Overall, ok. Frankly, there is not a lot of flavor here, good or bad. Nice bitterness and it drinks clean."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.49,"Pours a healthy head that dissipates slowly. Nice smell of light maltiness. Nice crisp, smooth taste.

As far as macros go, this is tied with Amberbock in my opinion and would be tied with Busch Copper Lager if they still made it. A lot fewer compromises in this beer than in it's lesser tier siblings Budweiser or especially Busch.

Quite hard to find in 2020, but when you know a place that still has it and has it on sale, you jump on that deal. Long live Michelob Lager."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.7,"Of all the brands I tasted, Michelob Original Lager stands head and shoulders above the rest. I was offered one at a cook out 20 years ago and it's been a favorite since. Something about the taste blends perfectly with grilled beef. I haven't found a beer yet that even equals it. I wish I could say the same for Ultra. I bought it once by accident and gave 11 bottles to a friend."
Worst,Michelob (Original Lager),4.42,"This beer basically amounts to the cleanest macro adjunct (vienna/munich) style lager that could be brewed. Heavy barley backbone. Despite the maltiness, the 'noble european' hops are able to cut through the two row barley just enough to give it the perfect bitterness you want in a lager. Incredible that AB is capable of such great beers yet neglect them at the same time. Sadly an endangered brew. Get it while you can. My fav AAL, only schmaltz comes close to this"
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.48,"I used to enjoy this beer---I drank it real cold and real fast (being a small bottle it works well for this.) Apparently it's not very good, based on other reviews. But I enjoyed it!"
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.17,"I recently got this beer. It pours golden, a little bit hazy with a very mild white foam head. Aroma is very sweet, malty and some adjuncts, no hops. Taste is very sweet, lots of residual sugars there, overwhelming and not very refreshing. It´s a very good looking bottle, with a poor content."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.83,"This is possibly the most commonly available French beer where I live. I kind of like the tiny 250mL bottles too!

This beer has a nice deep golden colour to it. It's slightly cloudy, with a thin creamy layer on top.

The aroma is fairly standard. Malty with a slight creaminess. There is also some faint alcohol smell.

The flavour is slightly watery. There is a little bit of creamy malt flavour too. Towards the end, it gets a bit strange. There is some hoppy bitterness, but it isn't right. It becomes sort of metallic tasting.

Overall, this is nothing special. Drinkable, but I wouldn't seek it out ever again."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.35,"Good packaging is what motivated my wife to pick up this intriguing-looking euro.

Pale appearance, unimpressive head and rice smell. Medium carbonation.

Taste is fairly bland, very macro-esque, lots of corn-grain vibe.

It's what my wife calls a ""soda-pop"" beer: It's fizzy, comes with alcohol and it's sweet and doesn't have a strong enough malted grain taste to offend the wine-cooler and party-drink crowd.

Keeps you drinking without thinking. Not impressed."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.53,"250ml bottle, quite reminiscent of Euro-Cokes, but un flacon? Je ne sais pas...

This beer pours a clear medium golden yellow hue, with one finger of weakly foamy, bubbly, and soapy dirty white head, which flees rather hastily, leaving some sparse blobs of cob-webbed lace around the glass.

It smells of semi-sweet cereal malt, a bit of wet cardboard, rice husks, a bit of astringent apple skin, and weedy, musty hay-like hops. The taste is lightly biscuity, bready malt, of the corn-fed variety, a sort of plastic, metallic character that I'm assuming comes from the underlying alcohol, and wet grassy, floral, weedy hops.

The carbonation is moderate, but also a wee bit sharp at times, the body medium-light in weight, and smooth enough, I suppose. It finishes with a weird warming sweetness, and a more than off-setting solvent stink, to no-one's surprise.

I couldn't sense much of a typical Euro-skank wafting from the glass, initially, but it slowly builds as things progress, the booze seeping in. Not a particularly pleasant experience, as the adequate graininess just gets lost in the musty mire."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.75,"Look: Pale golden in color, transparent and with a little bit of white foam crown that does not lace much.

Nose: grainy aroma

Taste: Grainy / rice-like notes predominate without any bitterness to finish.

Mouth: Thin or watery mouthfeel

Drink: The beer has a relatively favorful appeal, and is, therefore, easily drinkable (if un-skunked, that is). But it does not dazzle or possess the entirely subjective Wow!-factor, and thus, it can only excel so far."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.18,"500ml can looks great but beer in glass does not look good.

A- Darkish gold. Head dies down in a matter of seconds. Unappetizing patching and ring remain. Good number of bubbles rising.

S- Corn syrup. Lightest malt. Strong brewer's yeast.

T- Brewer's yeast all the way. Vitamin D pills. The brewer's yeast taste is definitely interesting yet borderline disgusting. I guess you could learn to appreciate it but I think the flavor should be finer or show more complexity to become interesting and ideally appreciated.

M- Ordinary macro mouthfeel tending toward watery. Seems viscous and dry at the same time which is strange and not particularly enjoyable.

D- Not high for me since I don't like the taste.Goes down kind of easy though.

Bad beer. Interesting because it's different though. I'd like to try a good beer with this ''brewer's yeast profile'' flavor if it exists."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.62,"Sample- 250 ml bottle- Very faint aromas here....not sure what they are. Herbs maybe? Taste is ok....mild hops, and I'm getting herbs here too. Maybe it is just me..haha. Light golden body that looks like a lot of other pilsners. Decent pils though....I like it. Thanks for this one Doug!"
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.86,"A: Pours a clear light yellow with a few fingers of white head.

S: Light apple, a little bit of malt.

T: Mild - light hops, light malts, pretty bland overall.

M: A little watery, medium carbonation.

D: Drinks easy enough, but not much there to keep you coming back for more."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.51,"From a 500mL can.

Pours a bright, clear, golden color with some fairly active carbonation that creates a thin wispy white ringed lace.

Slight esters in the nose with a base of cooked cereal grains and hints of buttery notes in the back; hello, you're not supposed to be here.

Mouthfeel is near medium, with a slight chewy water consistency. Lively and crisp carbonation on the palate. Mildly sweet with more cooked cereal grains, hint of berry-like esters, and dab of caramel. Powdery malts. Light herbal hop note; very light, and that's it for hops. Light metallic notes. Fairly clean finish, but there's something lingering that's kind of lackluster.

Nothing offensive here, but it's a bit bland and one-dimensional overall."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.7,"There's a listing for ""Boris"" and one for ""Boris- Le Flacon D'Alsace"", I figure it's the same thing so I'll just review it under the more popular name. Picked up a tallboy can at the LCBO, I thought the packaging was cool, didn't know it had such a bad rep on here. Alright, let's give it a shot.

Yellowy-amber appearance, with a small, fizzy white head that recedes to nothing quickly. Skunky smell with a rough, yeasty edge, nothing overwhelming.

The taste is watery, nothing spectacular, just yeasty and a bit bitter. Sort of that dull, skunky Heineken-y aftertaste. Bitter, earthy finish, weak hops. Thin mouthfeel, but still quaffable and inoffensive. Overall, tastes stale and uninspired.

It's still not bad, and I still drank it down without any complaints, but I definitely won't be paying for this again."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),3.01,"Pours yellow, big foamy head that sticks around, some lacing quite carbonated... a good looking lager.

Aroma of continental malt and a faint delicate aroma of fresh grassy hops. Flavor is a malt backbone being haunted with a bit to much dyacetyl and oxidation. Bitter finish is adequate but overall the beer seems a little sweet. After closer examination I realise the can is past its best before date by a few months.

Actally quite a respectable european example of a common lager, I'll bet it's quite good of a fresh tap in Alsace."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.95,"Poured a clear straw colour, 4 cm of head dissipates quite quickly. Little carbonation visible. Smells yeasty and grassy. Little jumps out in the taste; some generic grains/bread taste, with a bitterness that sits heavily on the back of the tongue. Slightly drying. Light body with slight carbonation.
The can is fairly striking, with the logo of a man running with a flag. An individualist slogan is printed overtop of the logo. Somewhat ironic given the bland nature of this beer. While never offensive, this beer is simply too middle of the road and boring for me to recommend, or try again."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.69,"Purchased bottle at Bishop's Cellar in Halifax.

Appearance: Pours a pale amber colour with a small bone white head, resides very quickly to almost nothing.

Aroma: Sweet, musty grains, a little bread and a little grassy.

Taste: Sweet, light struck, low bitterness. Not very nice.

Mouthfeel: Thin body, higher carbonation.

Final Statement: Not recommended."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.36,"Tiny bottle, poured into a fluted glass.

A couple centimeters of foam soon rise and fall. Clear amber yellow coloration. Stubborn yeast ring at the bottom. Spotty patterned lacing.

Very skunky smell, husky grain.

Taste is fairly bitter, with a watery mouthfeel. Toasted cracker. An apple aftertaste, the only redeeming quality...suggesting yeast was actually used in the process.

Picked this up for $1 on a whim at Dobbys in the burbs, based solely on the label design & price. Won't be buying again."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.6,"500ml can..no date code

Hard pour puts a crystal clear gold lager in the glass with a instantly disappearing cap and no lacing ( uh-oh is see adjucts)

Aroma...like wet paste board soaked in weak corn syrup ( uh-oh is smell dextrin syrups)

Taste: fizzy, bland, watery, wealk malt presence, over filtered with the prominenece of stale over-boiled cheap hop pellets..finish is dry, fast and there is a malt/corn extract cardboard after taste (uh-oh I taste malt extracts and dextrin syrup suppliments)

Now I know why I waited years to buy just one to sample because buying six would leave 5 to go bad waiting for me to revist this bland over-processed concoction....in the vein of domestic extract-brewed buck a beer swill, but priced like a premium import...pass it up."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),1.78,"Brought over by a friend a few weeks back. Really not good at all. Unpleasant aroma, and even worse flavour. Adjuncty. Light mouthfeel. Something off (rotten vegetables?). Way high on the carbonation, and a dull, icky aftertaste. Drain poured the remaining three."
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.85,"cute as hell bottle..250ml..certainly a wordier slogan on the label than ' I Am Canadian'. There goes 1/2 of the canuck market right there.

lager amber yellow, bit cloudy as there was some sediment in the botton of the bottle. Poor head retention aand equally poor lacing.

smell is unobtrusive..faint sweetness..some malt

taste: sweet initally with subtle malt, a taf metallic in the middle and then a kick of hop bitterness.

has a dry finish..ok mouthfeel


appearance and smell bring down this score..but certainly comparable to Grolsch or Heiniken.

note..although it come in a green bottle..the packaging is sealed..hence no light struck hops..ie..no skunk"
Worst,Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),2.63,"500 ml can. Best before 05/08.

A- A clear pale gold beer with white head. Minor effervescence. Head settles far too quickly.

S- Faint hops. A little ""funny"" smelling (mushroomy). Faint grassy notes and very faint fruity notes. It barely has a smell.

T- Very watery with slight bitter hops up top and in finish. Basic unispired macro lager. Not skunky, probably because its in a light-blocking aluminum can. There is a mildewy note in the middle that does not fit and just tastes off.

MF- Light and watery, but not bad for the style.

D- Easy drinker to wash food down with. But there are much more pleasant ways to achieve that end."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.41,"This is a great starting point if your not familiar with double IPA's. Not to strong, but enough of a kick! Yes, there is a slight aftertaste that is kinda weird. But this is a totally drinkable beer and so affordable! Give this one a taste! I will definitely buy this again! Thank you Trader Joe's!"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.19,I love the reviews I read for this beer I was given a 6-pack by my daughter's boyfriend I think it's pretty good and now that I know it's so cheap I like it even better
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.4,"This is an odd one.
It tastes like a Belgian ale trying really, really hard to be an Imperial IPA- and not a great Belgian either, too thin to be a Belgian. Almost no bitterness. Not a lot of complexity in the flavors here. Could be improved by picking, once and for all, what this beer wants to do with its life, and then either adding citrus peel to make it more Belgiany or more hops to make it more Imperial. It does not taste double hopped, but it definitely hits like a double IPA at 8.4%, while also being five bucks a 6-pack at Trader Joe's... so, that does sway my review here. If it were any more expensive or tasted any worse, I'd say it's not worth it. But, as it's less than a dollar a can for a drinking experience that is not overtly unpleasant, I'll say it's a good value for its price. Will likely buy again next time my job cuts my hours."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.04,"This is my 1st attempt at submitting a ""rating"" on this site.
The plethora of ""beer snobs"" and their command of ""beer speak"" on this siteis impressive.
Here's my ""review"" . . .
I agree with the notion that this brew's taste is more Belgian, than IPA . . . Nevertheless, it's ""in-your-face"" flavor is pretty good
With an ABV of 8.4% and a price point that can't be beat . . . this is the perfect ""get buzzed quick"" brew
BTW, it pairs well with most sativas ;-)"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.82,Let me start out by saying this beer sucks. All of the Boatswain beers taste awful. But given todays current inflation the price point cannot be beat. At $4.99 plus deposit and tax it’s still a great value. This is how I get around that nasty taste. Just add a tsp of fresh lime juice more or less depending on taste. Now you have a Corona on steroids just don’t pore in a clear glass. Lol
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.82,"nice amber color, but the head is massive loose bubbles like root beer or cola that lasts maybe 1 minute. no lacing. overtly malty smell and taste. unremarkable mouthfeel. much more like a badly executed Belgian than any kind of IPA. My wife called it disgusting."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.67,"Overall; This beer reminds me a lot of Pyramid brewing's Outburst IPA. A dominating sweet malt bill. Nothing citrusy about the European type hops. Along with a high ABV. If you like Outburst you will like this beer. Very much a 90's type beer...

12 Oz can. No package date. Poured into a pint glass

Pours a light orange/honey colored body with a white head. Not much retention. A few rings of speck lacing.

Nose is very understated. I'm getting sweet malt with a tiny whiff of German style hops.

Taste is very reminiscent of Pyramid brewing's Outburst IPA. Hops under the radar along with a dominating sweet malt bill

Feel is appropriate for the style.

Overall-see first paragraph"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.65,"An excellent DIPA. Easy to drink. I enjoyed straight out of the can as well as in a glass. Has a strong, hoppy aftertaste that feels good in the back of the throat."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.58,"If you love beer, you will like this one alot. Not the best, but not the worst. I'm not a ""dangle my pinky and talk about the flavor notes"" type. I just like beer. This one is tasty but strong, and goes down easy. Give it shot. You will not regret it. If you do, put it back on the shelf because then there will be more for me."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.61,"It literally tastes like how a BandAid smells. You KNOW what I'm talking about here. Rubber and cotton and adhesive.

I jumped on this at TJ's today -- a double IPA for $4.99? Sure, sign me up! The amber color of my first pour was surprising, as was the nose -- rubber and alcohol. But the taste is what put this over the edge -- sweet and malty -- not anything like any double IPAs I've ever tried. Downright nasty, actually. It has an 8.4% ABV, which is great and all -- if you can stomach this abomination...I can't.

Even at this price point, I'm never doing this again."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.53,"L- Nice warm honey colored body with a nice and tall foamy head. Nice color contrast
S- Notes of Caramel in an otherwise very neutral smelling IPA.
T- Tbh I love this more than I think I should. Unlike most IPA it does have a nice bitterness, but there is a nice caramelized taste that brings a nice sweetness and roast to the beer.
M- Bubbly as hell
O- A great beer considering the price and coming from Trader Joe's. Highly recommend for the uniqueness, I'll buy it again!"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.96,"Not vile, but not good. First, the positive- decent color and carbonation, with a perky acceptable head. But... it is hard to get past the paint thinner nose.
At least it tastes like something. That something is caramel or malt or maybe some low-end mixed drink from a plastic novelty bottle. For the price, it is a reasonable offering if only for the robust alcohol level."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.92,"it is especially interesting and telling that this is far from the worst of these trader joes beers i have had, but that i also didnt finish it. again though, a buck a piece its hard not to pull the trigger with the hops of discovering a quality budget brew, but it is not to be with this one. malty and robustly alcoholic, i cant get past how sweet it is, caramelized almost like an american barleywine, and might even work better under that name. there is a candied fruitiness to the hops, but its interrupted by a strong astringency and metallic property that kick up about midway through the taste trajectory, fully disrupting and once its there, it doesnt really go away. i can actually appreciate that this has a whole mess of hops in it, and might even be dry hopped, some sweet orange peel comes to mind here along with more familiar pine resin, but the beer is objectively poorly done, and the bad parts stand out well ahead of the limited good ones. just super cheap tasting and feeling, thin for what it is, overly sweet, and just a mess of a beer. discerning palates will have trouble with this one..."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.8,"Like others, 12oz can from Trader Joe's, dateless. Poured into rose glass.
L: Light brown, caramel color with a tall foamy not retentive white head. Not many bubbles present, they all shot to the top.
S: Caramelly, stale bread, and malty on the nose, a bit burnt, perhaps some nut or banana involved. The smells grows on me as I whiff.
T: Flat, stale holiday bread. More banana and burnt caramel. It tastes like it wants to be much more than it is, flavor uncomplex but not gross.
F: Oily and undeveloped, slips right off the tongue.
Overall, this beer I would not order, as there are more splendid alternatives, but if offered one I would not turn it down. The smell is the one redeeming quality here, otherwise it is a bit of a letdown."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.73,"12oz can from joe's, no date

Looks and smells great, sweet smelling and malty, herbal hops in the background. Drinking it from the can, it's boozy with dulled hops and the sweet taste of honey long into the finish

Unfairly savaged on here by the snobs. This may be a malt bomb, but it's a damn good one"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.15,"Bought it at Trader Joes. Thought maybe a bargain. No sir. Stuck with these and I down them only for the 8.5%, nothing like a IPA. Putrid taste that is heavy and just wallows in Your stomach. But 8.5%, so they say. Only 1 left to drink then never again. Boatswain. Taste like the side of a boat"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1,"Found this at Trader Joe’s and thought 5 bucks for a 6 pack of double IPA? Why not? My first drink was my last drink, I’m not the type to pour a beer down the sink but with this one I had to. It does not taste like an IPA whatsoever. No hoppy taste or citrus taste or anything. Taste like a 20 dollar 6 pack of Beligian beer. So if you like Belgians you’ll like this but don’t expect an IPA flavor"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.38,"$5 for 6. 8.4% ABV. You can't be expecting much. And you won't be disappointed, as long as you're not expecting much. Its an acceptable way to get buzzed. Nothing more, but nothing less.
But no, bears absolutely no resemblance to any Double IPA I know."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.7,"As pretty much everyone has pointed out, this is not an IPA or anything even remotely resembling an IPA. If you were looking forward to drinking a nice double IPA with hops, citrus, bright but delcious biterness, etc, you will be very disappointed.

On the flip side, it's not THAT bad of a beer. Just close your eyes and pretend you are drinking an exotic, rare belgian beer that you paid $25 for, as opposed to some cheap TJ beer that sells for like $1 a can. If you are able to reframe your entire existence, including everything you have learned about this world up to this point, you may just fine this beer is enjoyable. Cheers."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),2.68,"Purchased at TJ. Is very inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for

Pours a clear deep amber. Has a nice sized head with huge bubbles

Does not smell like an IPA

Does not taste like an IPA, more of a Belgian

Feel is average

I guess it is better than Budwiser so for the price okay but I will be staying away from this in the future"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),1.69,"I’m not sure what to say. My roommates and I have argued about this one a lot and really all come to the same conclusion. This isn’t an IPA. Pours like an IPA, looks like an IPA but smells like a beligian that went bad and tastes like nothing on the beer market. It’s as if the brewer has too much pride to change his recipe. I can’t imagine anyone liking this
beer... It’s just a really bad lager with too much alcohol... why call it a DIPA??"
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.28,"Reminds me of Flying Dog Raging Bitch. Belgium malty, sweet, high abv IPA! I really like this style. It of course is not quite as good as Raging B, but it's close and half the price..."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.59,"Ok,wasn't expecting much from my prior experiences with Minhas Brewery. Was pleasantly surprised,actually,as the Twin Screw really is a compliment to the brewery...The ABV of 8.4 made me think what I was getting was more like Malt Liquor and in ways I was right,but malt liquor that is far more refined than your average 40. I really like it and I won't apologize...it has some weirdness to it (not a bad thing) hops that seem distant and malt that seems slightly over-the-top but for 4.99..HEY! TJ's does it again...I will definitely keep it on my shopping list.3 of these and it's a party.LOL."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),4.28,"whoever compared this to an imperial stout was correct in that some imperial stouts are balanced and not deeply colored. I could not call it a double ipa since it seems to have no relation to the current rage for dominant floral hops or unpleasant bitterness, which I would not call beer. this a very well-balanced ale with a wide range of hop and malt nose and tongue notes that evolve as the beer warms and releases various esters, phenolics, etc that can only come from an ale. drink this beer starting from ice-cold and make it last to room temp for a multidimensional experience. leave a very small amount in the glass and continue to sniff. those who rate it low must be unfamiliar with anything beyond overwhelming modern hop bombs. if you want mango, grapefruit, pine resin, citrus, etc, go elsewhere to the many ""craft"" ipas or fruit juices. I buy this frequently at Trader Joe's-the price is incredible compared to many of the beers available-and it is a great adjunct to my normal diet of expensive ""crankcase oil"" malty ales."
Worst,Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),3.34,"I bought three of these at TJ's. The cash register person at TJ's said her boyfriend did not like this beer. I assumed I was not going to like it because I drink a lot of big name, little name, and everything in between IPA. I won't serve it to my IPA friends but will let them try it. It actually reminded my of Surly Furious (with a hint of Fat Tire). I had two of these and was done drinking beer for the night (weeknight). I think I will buy a few more and see if it is consistent with the first few I bought. $.84 for a DIPA? I have spent a lot more for a lot less."

I really want to like the High Life but just can't get past the greasy vegetable oil aftertaste finish this beer gives. Maybe its the Galena hops that they use. I tried to find other beers that use these hops but have had no such luck. Molson Coors has retired very drinkable & palate pleasing lagers such as Extra Gold & even Milwaukee's Best Premium. Hamm's and Banquet are the two most enjoyable AAL's that this brewery brews. Not being a ""hater"" I will buy and drink a 40 of MLH in hopes I will see and taste
something different."
Worst,Miller High Life,2.29,"Acquired as part of a trade/proxy with @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022.

As with all Miller beers, this one looks gorgeous in the glass. It's a crystal clear yellow with a bright white head and bubbles racing up the middle of the glass. It leaves nice lacing on the way down. This is how my old man's beers looked when I was growing up in the 80s. But as with my old man's beers, once you go from eye to mouth, things start going downhill.

On the nose, there's a corny sweetness. It's not appealing in an age of tropical fruit bombs or rich, roasty stouts. There's no hop presence and in fact very little aroma at all. This won't scare off the beer's intended audience, though.

Taste is a letdown even after the nose. There's a minerally, soda water vibe going on. There's some sweet malt, but it's like the beer is produced with postmix and even then the beer syrup in the packet is on its last legs. There is utterly no hop body. The beer has some bitterness, so there are clearly hops in the beer, but maybe they were only waved in the general direction of the boil, rather than actually inserted.

Feel is ok. The carbonation comes through more strongly than I would have expected and it definitely overshadows what taste there is, so the sensation on the swallow again brings to mind carbonated postmix. I've seen a few reviews that point to the beer's excellent softness and generous mouthfeel, but I just don't get it.

I specifically requested some American macros in the trade/proxy that this beer came in, and I'm glad I did, and I will again. Even living in Australia I'm aware of the iconic nature of this beer and its tagline. I'm also aware that it no longer lives up to what a craft beer drinker wants in a beer, but then nor is it meant to. There's an audience for this beer, and it's not a craft beer drinker, but it is a craft beer collector who wants to experience the full gamut of the world's beers, and I'm very much in that camp. It's near impossible to get it through normal channels and I'm glad I went to the effort to get this one. I've loved receiving, pouring and drinking this beer, even though as far as beer goes, it's pretty ordinary. It'll get marked up a little in the overall mark because ultimately it's my overall experience I'm rating here, and in those terms it didn't disappoint at all.

Cheers!"
Worst,Miller High Life,2.52,"Poured into a beer mug and it was a really clear light golden color with a thick white head. Could not really smell much of anything in the glass. Decent taste and a good thirst quencher, especially on a day after working in the yard or around the house."
Worst,Miller High Life,3.92,Looks good smell is not offensive but sweet. Taste has a strong malt sweetness . Very distance hop flavor like all the way at the end of the street. Mouth feel is extremely smooth. I have drank like 200ish bottles in order to make the review and it is a great beer for the price been buying it for 12 pack bottles for $6.50
Worst,Miller High Life,3.28,"Poured from a 7oz pony bottle into a rocks glass.

On the pour not a lot of head forms because there is so little liquid and I was a bit too gentle. Over a couple minute the head actually grows from the streams of carbonation rocking up the sides of the glass. Body is a light golden color just a touch darker than straw, leaves light lacing. Good looking beer.

Aroma is grainy with some skunked hops present. This is likely less present in the canned version, but the clear bottles will definitely be skunky. The skunk isn't overwhelming but present and verging on bad. The maltiness of this beer isn't completely covered however. Some corny vibes but it doesn't smell watered down.

Flavor follows the aroma and loses a bit of the skunk amd trades it for a sweet grainy crisp flavor. Some cheapness does come through but miller makes some pretty good cheap beer. The flavor profile is pretty soft and bready with some very very light notes of the hops on the very back end, however they do still provide some bitterness.

Feel is where miller shines the brightest. On the sip isn't feels big while still being refreshing and not too heavy in the stomach. Big carbonation on this one, but it's fine carbonation giving this one decent body.

Overall I think miller makes one of the best American mass market lagers out there, and so far they haven't let me down. Sweet without being too syrupy and bringing the malt flavor that not hoppy beer should have. Refreshing and not too many off flavors like some AALs."
Worst,Miller High Life,2.75,Most all domestic beer seems to be a disappointment nowadays..Most beer drinkers think that it used to be of much better quality. Miller High Life was at one time regarded as a quality beer then became a cheap trash beer of the 80ies and 90ies. Few years back they improved it with newer type shelf stable yeasts and the quality has actually came back and it's not too bad compared to the other domestic beers out there. With that said I still miss the quality that all domestic U S beer used to have and now lacks.The big breweries think beer drinkers are uneducated slobs and will drink anything because they can't tell the difference.
Worst,Miller High Life,4.26,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds. This one is showing a strong running - no offensive smells or flavors. A light-bodied, easy-drinking super-bready malt, I think it's top contender at the moment to unseat. I'll sort this all out and revisit my reviews/ratings after my quest completes."
Worst,Angkor Beer,2.54,"6 pack from Fubonn Market (PDX). Was not as bad as I thought it would be. Bright, clear golden pour, big fluffy head. Smell and taste are grains, corn and only slight traces of vegetal notes. Feel is actually kind of creamy. Not too sweet either. First Cambodia tick."
Worst,Angkor Beer,1.96,"Shared 330 ml can, kindly brought home from Cambodia by my cousin. ABV is 5%. Pale golden colour, moderate white head. Minimal aroma. Watery mouthfeel. The flavour is quite dry and rather bland as expected, with a hint of hops in the finish."
Worst,Angkor Beer,3.2,"When your in Cambodia, it's decent and an easy go-to, rather than paying the premium for imported beers. Ignore the bad reviews when your at a bar, though I can't speak about it's quality outside."
Worst,Angkor Beer,3.52,"12 oz slim can traded from brutal farce poured into 16 oz Budweiser pint glass.

Clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head of 2 fingers. It gradually diminishes to a sliver, no lacing.

Aroma is husky and grainy, slight sweet apple fruit, almost cider-y. Faint maize.

Flavor is crisp and clean with a nice rice/plant/barley flavor. Not much for lingering flavor except a slight champagne dryness and lingering pear and apple fruits. Corn creaminess as well.

Feel is crisp and clean with only mild starches on the finish. Very good carbonation.

Overall, a poor rating is not warranted, simply because a lager is not going to give the flavors that other more eccentric styles will. This is a cut and dry enjoyable, quenchable, by-the-book lager that stands with the rest. Fear not, take the dive, you won't lose beer karma if you drink it."
Worst,Angkor Beer,3.02,"Pours a very pale gold with no head and very aggressive bubbles

Smells very grainy, of Cheerios

Taste was more interesting, light cracker with some floral notes and tart apple

Very dry, overly carbonated"
Worst,Angkor Beer,3.03,"Poured into a small pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of grainy malt, lemon and grassy hops. Flavor is mild grainy, slightly sweet malt, grassy hops, thinning out and getting astringent in the finish. Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. On the grainy side of the adjunct lager spectrum, but the malt pretty much dies out half way through the taste, leaving the somewhat astringent (possibly just old) hops stark on the tongue. The neutral malt sweetness that usually make this style inoffensive is not present here, this just tastes like a watered down lager. I liked their stout and decided to give this a shot, but although I might welcome this on a hot Cambodian afternoon, it's not worth revisiting outside its country of origin. Drinkable, but mediocre."
Worst,Angkor Beer,4.45,"Angkor has a thick, white head, a clear, golden, bubbly appearance, with splotchy glass lacing. The aroma is of fairly rich, honeyed malt and bread crust. Taste is similar, with rounding hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Angkor finishes crisp and refreshing.

RJT"
Worst,Angkor Beer,2.35,"Drank this more times than I can count on the beach in southern Cambodia. When it's ice cold and 50 cents a glass it goes great with grilled squid or whatever is available to munch on. Went to the brewery but was turned away, told to come back the next day and would be able to sample for free. Yeah, nevermind."
Worst,Angkor Beer,2.68,"Had it on tap at Temple Bar in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

L:
Clear, gold straw in color with 2 fingers short-life white head, not of much of lace to mention, high visible carbonation.

S:
Grainy, grassy, a bit earthy, old cereal cracker.

T:
Grain and grass dominate all along. Some astringency pops up sharp with moderate hop bitterness. Some bread note of malt and some bitterness again as residual.

F:
Light body, semi-smooth mouthfeel, high carbonation, crisp, dry and rather clean finish.

O:
This beer is nothing more than proper thirst quencher from your long and tired day with hot and humid weather in Siem Reap."
Worst,Angkor Beer,2.79,"Clear yellow with no head. Smells grainy and sweet. Surprisingly inoffensive! It's a thin, sweet-sour crap lager, but with just enough character to make it fun. I think it's the light fruitiness of the malt."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,2.88,"Clear gold appearance with a small white head and sparce lacing. Neutral aroma, no distinguishing hop scents, nothing about the malt bill to get excited about. But, nothing off or bad either. Taste raises the bar a little. Grains are noticeable while the hops add a soft floral touch. Nicely carbonated, light-to-medium bodied mouthfeel leading to a short lived finish."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,4,"I think this Japanese lager is my favorite American lager if that makes any sense.
I will compare the sensation og taking a nice big gulp of this wonderful beer to jumping in the river on a 100 degree day.
It would be interesting to do a ""Blindfold Taste Test"" between this beer and all the other AALs.
I think I would be able to back up my assertion but who knows until I actually do the test.
At any rate..if you like AALs I am sure you will really like this one."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.56,"L: pale gold with fine white head
S: malt, hops pepper, and banana
T: faint maltiness with a dry finish
F: fine carbonation

Would buy again, a good lager that would go well with a wide variety of food."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.5,"Simple lager, kind of sweet, light body. This is very easy to drink, and refreshing. Goes well with sushi as it's no overpowered flavor. Nothing super exciting here but nothing wrong either."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.69,"This is Japan's malt beer, very similar to Molson Golden in Canada but with less sugars. My favorite Japanese beer you can get in the US. Not a craft beer but an incredibly easy and pleasant beer to the palate and nose. Fantastic malt beer. As good as the malts get. Earthy, sweet, robust."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.1,Kirin Ichiban (Number One) is rather underwhelming. Bland taste with non-existent nose. Light body and mediocre balance does not offer much. It can quench a thirst on a hot day. Do not know how hot it gets in Japan. OK.
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,5,Wow only 64 I actually really liked it! I I tried it from a small bottle gave off a nice multi aroma beautiful golden light color I actually had some nice hoppy flavor to it as well! Definitely a premium lager!
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.24,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Pilsner glass at 50 degrees. One finger white head. Minor lacing.

S - Scent is a light bread cracker malt. Light crispness as well.

T - Taste follows scent. Light bready malt. Not hoppy at all. No bitterness. A little buttery. Easy to drink.

F - Medium carbonation. Medium mouthfeel

O - Overall, a solid beer. Straightforward flavor profile. Would definitely drink again."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.33,"Tall can of Kirin Ichiban, billed as first press 100% Malt, pours a crystal clear, light straw gold with two fingers of foamy head. The head has… surprising staying power? Or maybe not? If I was more objective I wouldn’t be so surprised, expecting a macro to be as bad as the Labatts and Coors of the world. This looks objectively great. Straightforward and crispy lager aromas of strong cereal grains and toasted malt. Slightly grassy background. Classic and straightforward.

Unfortunately, the palate falls short of the appearance and aroma, which are both straightforward but very nice. Not that the taste is bad per se. The malt is more gentle, but the grainy taste of a lager is here. Slightly bready in character, slightly grassy with the mildest of bitterness, the taste is washed away by a slight watery sensation. Light bodied as can be expected with medium carbonation that can only be described as crisp, there is a nice prickliness on the tongue that quickly washes the beer down on each sip with a very snappy character. The only thing left each time is a very, very mild biscuity, gently malty bread finish.

Objectively, if you’re honest with yourself on the feel and look of the beer (and the taste being thoroughly average) each rating would absolutely clock way above the Avg on BA. Hard to see people here rank it so low on looks when lagers and pils from Anchor, Founders, or Deschutes breweries are given almost perfect marks despite looking nigh identical. The beer is thoroughly unremarkable in the taste department but by no means *bad*. If anything, this beer clocks above most macros simply by way of avoiding the completely washed out corn adjunct taste of most macro beers, and avoids the metallic tinge common to all too many canned macros.

Would I go out of my way to have this again? Unlikely. Did I enjoy it more than most macros? Absolutely. Is it bad tasting? Not at all. Most Asian-themed, Chinese, and Japanese restaurants tend to have limited selection on tap, so is this something I’d order over other ones there? Probably yes!

When people say ‘hey the beer snobs hate macros but I love my crisp and clean beer!’ THIS is the taste I always imagined. Bud, Coors, Labatt, Busch, all are unsavoury in some ways, some metallic, some unfortunate corn-y tastes. Kirin Ichiban surprisingly outpaces all of those beers.

Important Identifiers: Kirin Ichiban First Press 100% Malt, poured from a 473mL can. No canning date, but drank from a large shipment from the LCBO, likely fairly fresh. Can bottled and brewed under license by the Labatt brewery in Canada, rather than the Japanese brewery."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.71,"Despite copping backlash for being ""yet another generic mainstream lager"", this beer actually carries itself well. Yes, there's some corn and a bit of grass, but it's moderately hopped, crisp and generally well put together, which is exactly what this beer should be.

In the glass, it pours a shining golden yellow. The Head quickly disappears and carbonation is not exactly jumping out of the glass.

Aroma-wise there's not much there. Perhaps some crackers and bread and the faintest floral hoppy note.

Taste-wise it's dry, moderately bitter and carries unmistakable biscuit with some corn and grass, but none of the offensive blandness that can characterise some generic international lagers. For mine, it's the moderate floral hoppiness that carries this beer, and it does so in a way that doesn't unbalance the beer given the relatively light body.

Mouthfeel is dominated by significantly more prickly carbonation than is evident from sight, but it's not an unpleasant or overbearing sensation.

Overall, this beer is what it should be. It's meant for consumption without significant contemplation, and its dryness and relatively neutral taste profile means it would suit most foods. If you expect a hoppy, fruity craft lager, you'll be disappointed. if you expect a reasonably generic international lager boosted by a moderate but not overbearing bitterness, which is what this beer is, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Cheers!"
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,2.99,"12oz bottle from Hops & Bottles. This beer keeps coming up on lists, so it's about time I checked this one off. Pale golden pour, thin white head, lively carbonation. Aroma is grainy, crackers, faint vegetal notes. Taste is grainy, adjunct grains, oily. Light bitterness. Just OK"
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3,"12oz bottle.

Pours clear yellow with a short-lived head of white. Corn bread with a touch of honey in the nose. Light bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Toasted corn flakes on the palate with minimal bitterness and faint malt. Finishes watery and timid in flavor."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,3.7,"12 oz. bottle poured into 13 oz. tumbler
Look: 2-finger creamy head, light golden almost transparent color, heavy carbonation
Smell: Strong bready aroma hits you right away, a little fruity,
Taste: Malt forward, slight bitterness, some sweetness on the back end. A little more complex than a typical macrobrew.
Feel: A tongue tingler, mouthfeel pretty typical of lager, dry finish. The flavor lingered after finishing the glass,
Overall: A middle of the road beer. Would I get it again? Probably, if the mood struck and I was doing a Japanese-themed meal.
Pair with hamburgers, pizza and fast food. I wouls also go with sushi, Ramen and a teriyaki or yakitori."
Worst,Kirin Ichiban,2.99,"Meh American Lager!!! Pours a nice clear gold color with a big fizzy white head that fades fast. Thin bands of lacing on the glass, head retention is less than average. Taste and aroma is the ""rice and corn"" background with a little maltiness and some mild grassy hops. There is bit of a metallic taste here too....Not great. Mouthfeel feaures a lot of carbonation and an overall weak, watery ""feel"". A lawnmower beer at best."
Worst,Old German,3.61,"16oz can stamped 0252 0211 poured into a tall pilsner glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on label. The beer pours bright light golden yellow with off white head. The head recedes to a thin uneven cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is pilsner malt and slight yeast. Maybe a hint of orchard fruit. The taste is semisweet pale malt with a noticeable sour corn finish. Maybe a hint of oxidation as well. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, ok. This can is presumably 8 months old at this point, so it was bound to not be it's best. I would definitely try again as all the makings of a solid AAL are there."
Worst,Old German,4,"Old German has a thick, soapy head, and a clear, bubbly, straw appearance, with some fine white sediment, throughout. The aroma is of funky, wet grain. The flavor is of slightly-sweet cereal grain, with practically no hop bitterness. Old German has a medium body and a crisp finish.

RJT"
Worst,Old German,2.87,"Picked this up from the cheap foods rainbow foods outlet. Big 24 oz can I think.

Pours looking like your standard adjunct lager, straw yellow, fizzy white head 2/5"". Aroma was corn and lager yeast. Little bit of those hydraulic fluid feels that adjunct lagers can get.

Taste, you can tell after the massive carbonation push, is mostly corn, grain and bittering hops to a lesser degree. Its light bodied enough. I dig the German guy on the logo though, I'm sure there is somehow some purple hair gape mouth selfie taker who finds it problematic. Kind of makes me think of this as more of a session like Country Club (malt liquor). Its not ever going to be a go to beer, but sure man, 100 degree weather, I'd crush one of these again in between other beers as a palate cleanser if you will.

I don't think there is anything offensive here, its largely one of those beers that tastes like a carbonated water boilermaker shot was dropped into a normal BMC like beer."
Worst,Old German,1.82,"Ok, right out of the starting gate you know this isn't going to be a beer of any real quality. It runs about 12 bucks for a 30 pack, so you know you're buying a beer to quench your thirst and probably nothing more.
Pours a very light yellow with a fizzy, short lasting head. No aroma, and a very weak body. Honestly, if I had tasted this blindfolded, I might have pegged it as a weak tasting cream soda!
The phrase used as their slogan, ""The world knows no finer"" is no small exaggeration, to be sure. But if you are looking for an inexpensive (ok, CHEAP) beer to have at a cook out, or something similar, this beer would do the trick... but barely."
Worst,Old German,3.06,"I found this beer at my local distributor, 15 pack for $9.99. The marketing is nothing special, it's a silly german caricature with a red banner.

Let's be real, this is not gourmet beer, it's a cheap (really cheap) lager you get when you want a buzz without spending more than your spare change. For that class of beer, Old German is actually great. I wasn't expecting much for taste, but it has a decent carbonated hoppy flavor that beats anything Coors or Miller Lite. Personally, I love carbonated beer, so I may have a positive bias for the taste. I will say, though, this beer needs to be ice cold to enjoy. It's not a Bavarian import that tastes good warm, no sir. Put it in the cooler.

The best aspect of this beer, is that it isn't a headache in a can like natural ice or other dirt cheap beers out there. What I'm saying, is that it won't punish you the next day, so long as you don't go overboard.
Overall, a cheap, decent tasting light beer to go along with throwing football with the pals, or washing your motorcycle. I'd rather have Carlsberg Elephant, but I can't always justify 11 dollars for a six pack."
Worst,Old German,2.95,"I had never seen or heard of this before but as soon as I saw a cheap fifteen pack I was hooked. The ridiculous caricature of a Bavarian is probably too stupid to be culturaly insensitive, but its close. Stupidly light color and perfect clarity: this looks like store brand apple juice. Nose doesn't seem to exist.

A little bit of malt sweetness and a respectable bread note. Otherwise kind of watery and blah overcarbonated in the finish, but for the style it is inoffensive and drinkable, if generic and mediocre."
Worst,Old German,2.54,"I saw this in my friend’s fridge the other evening and just had to try one. Never saw an “Old German Beer” before. Um, very light colored but hey it looks like beer. Smell...beery in a slight way. Taste, carbonated water with some slight malts. It’s really hard to pull a flavor out of this stuff. Feel...It had some suds to it. If you don’t want the underpowered flavor of some other junk adjunct light beer, then give this one a try."
Worst,Old German,3.28,This is a great beer for the money. $4.99 for a six pack of tall boys. There's nothing wrong with a good cheap honest American lager. Easily as good or better than Hamm's or Pabst depending on on your taste.
Worst,Old German,2.96,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn, some malts. Taste is the same as the aroma, very mild, almost like a light lager. Feels light bodied in the mouth and overall, nothing offensive, but boring. I guess at $13 for a case, I shouldn't complain."
Worst,Old German,2.76,"Old German pours exactly as you'd expect it to, yet even lighter. About as straw yellow as an AAL could be, with champagne bubbles and even a white champagne like head that bursts up, then falls back down. Light surface coverage, even lighter lacing.

An extra dose of skunk from the hops come along with bland cracked grain, honey and corn syrup. Not asking for an Oscar, that's obvious.

I didn't think it was possible, but it's even lighter than it looks. Carbonated water with just mentions of those aromas listed above transcending into the flavor.

Exceptionally light and dry, yet balanced. Leaves you kind of smacking your tongue to the roof of your mouth between sips. Did I mention it's dry?

Would I buy this again? Maybe not, but would I drink it again? Shit yeah, I'm easy. Throw some my way and I'll pound of few hundred with you. Uh oh... I think I'm getting a headache. Cheers!"
Worst,Old German,3.17,"An ok lager I had on tap. Not a sweet AAL as I expected, but also lacking a decent bitter pop.

Pours nicely light golden with a decent and fairly sustaining head.
Nose is mostly absent, but equally not off-putting.

Clean but somehow not crisp. There's a light lemony note that I wasn't expecting. To be honest, warmth wasn't a friend of this brew. It has a light soapy note to it which oddly didn't kill the beer for me. Unfortunately it took over the brew later into the taste.

Eh-I didn't enjoy this beer later as much as I found it ok early. Not gonna kill you, but not gonna rock your world either."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,1.55,"250 ml bottle, as Hoegaarden Citron, thanks to tarjei. ABV is 3.0%. Very pale straw coloured, slightly hazy, big to moderate white head. Aroma of lemon and lime (as expected), also more unpleasant notes of rotting fruits and vomit. The flavour is sugary sweet and citrussy, without the zesty freshness I hoped for (considering the beer had already had the misfortune of being diluted with this citrus stuff). Nope, this is not a beer for me. Drainpour."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,2.8,"Colour: light straw with a slight pink tinge, cloudy. Foam white, fine-bubble, quickly reduces.
The aroma of raspberry, lime, somehow empty.
Taste: The first sip and the beginning of linden honey, in a moment reappear sweet raspberry and lime, this time synthetic. Very poorly and thin"
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,2.58,"12oz Bottle

Appearance - Pours a cloudy yellow colour with a massive foamy/fizzy white head. I can't see much carbonation, and there seems to be some pretty decent lacing. The head lasted for 5 minutes or so.

Smell - lemons, sugar, wheat

Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the beer has a very sugary sweet and slightly bitter lemon taste. I'm not really sure that this qualifies as a beer - seems more like a lemon soda. There is a hint of wheat but the flavour is basically all lemons and sugar.

Overall - It's not horrible.. I've had some other fruit beers that were just way too sweet, this one at least has a little bit of balance. I would never have purchased this beer but it was a gift. I wouldn't have it again."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,1.94,"This is essentially Sprite beer. If you like sprite and want it as a beer, then this is for you!

Otherwise, if you want a beer this is pretty nasty. It is syrupy sweet like a soda and the carbonation adds to that feel.

I felt like I might as well have been drinking a wine cooler."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,2.9,"Girly lemon beer, probably not meant for the serious beer connaisseur.
Lemon colour, white head. Hazy.
Smell is of apple cider, riesling wine, lemon, lemon peels.
Taste is similar. It's got a slight dry finish to it. It's not too sweet.
No alcohol detected. Refreshing overall.

This beer does have an artificial taste to it, which makes it unpleasant in the finish. Overall it's not as bad as I expected though, reading some of the other comments upfront."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,1.89,"Appearance - Hazy pale yellowish with a big head that quickly disappears. Lots of carbonation!

Smell - Sweet with artificial lemon and lime.

Taste - Sweet, artifical taste of lemon and some lime, a bit sourness as well. An unpleasant taste of c-vitamin supplements that you dissolve in water

Mouthfeel - The sweet taste sticks in your mouth. It's carbonated a lot and has a light body.

Maybe a beer for a hot summer day but I'm thinking about spritzing some lemon into a Hoegaarden Wit would be much nicer!"
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,2.79,"Poured from a can purchased at a restaurant on the top of the Atomuium in Brussels (that oversized iron atom in one of the parks there, former site of a world's fair I guess...1958?...) into a clear plastic cup (the best thing that I could find up there).

A Soft, fluffy white head reminds me of whipped egg over a lemonade, slightly cloudy body. I like this look.

S Lemon lime, inviting, refreshing. It is certainly different as far as the smell, from other beers. The lemon lime crossed over a bit into a mediciny smell (alka-seltzer?) which I did not like so much.

T Ya know, like a Hoegaarden with lemon lime flavoring. I don't mean to be trite but it tastes exactly like I thought it would in that way. I think that Hoegaarden (the original) is an excellent starting point for a flavored beer and this beer shows that to be the case. The lemon lime did get to be a bit too much as I sipped on, edging into an unwelcome mediciny taste (again, alka-seltzer?)

M Light with that lemon lime taste and very low ABV.

D Good, especially on the hottest of days but it was too close to alka-seltzer to really be drinkable.

Notes: Cool to sample this beer a top the Anotomia in Brussels."
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,1.55,"gak. wtf. Got this little number from the corner store across the street from the train station in Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium. Shoulda left it there. Poured with a nice big foamy textured head and some lace. Funny looking hazy pale yellow color. Aroma = lemon pledge mixed with sauerkraut farts. You in a situation where you need to leave? open some cans of this. Whew. Pepe Le Pew wears this as an aftershave. flavor's not near so bad. Not saying much. Just have to put this down the drain and give my apologies to the sewer.Pierre Celis where are youuu?"
Worst,Hoegaarden Citron,2,"Small brown 25cl bottle with 5 months life left on opening. Poured into 'Hougaerdse DAS' tumbler.

Hazy pale yellow, I'd see a doctor if I passed this. The head, if there was one, left before I saw what colour it was.

Lime and lemon aroma, like a fizzy pop smell, sweet and unhealthy.

Very sweet for a citrus flavoured drink (notice I didn't say beer there?). The front label has a slice of lemon and lime as a picture, so you shouldn't be surprised to hear that is what it tastes of.

Syrupy sweet, sickly and I needed to clean my teeth after drinking it.

This is youngsters alco-pop sort of thing, not a serious beer drinkers choice."

polished-clear, gold liquid; 'foam' disappears in seconds... basically candied/crystallized ginger on the nose... just about the same on the palate - candied ginger, marginally ginger 'beer' aftertaste; mellow-moderate spicy bitterness, however, caramel sweetness holds momentarily before fading away, so it's not too terribly sweetish... somewhat flat in fizz; roundish, but short of viscous... flavorful enough, but also arguably bland; could use a bit more spicy (acidic) zip to achieve more balance with the dull sweet lull; liquid, diluted candy, more alco-pop than beer/malt-bev, more or less (1711)"
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.85,"(Original review from October 19, 2004)

I finally tried the ginger version of this. It has a light tan, ginger ale color to it. Some foam forms but it fizzes instantly away like soda. The aroma is sugary sweet and gingery, with a mouthfeel much like ginger ale. The flavor is sweet and gingery. It isn't as intense as a ginger beer, but still has a tiny bit more burn than a ginger ale. The aftertaste has some ginger flavor lingering along with some bready notes (the only beer-llike characteristic I detected. No alcoholic warmth to finish it out.

This is basically alcoholic ginger ale. It was much better than the bright red sorrel version, but it is still more alcopop than beer. I could actually imagine drinking this as a refreshing beverage, unlike the cloying sorrel version."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.13,"Transparent, pinkish blonde body with a small, broken head. Big time ginger aroma. Sugary sweet, some vanilla notes. Lots of ginger. Too sweet for me. No way I could drink much of this. Headache."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.63,"A: The beer is clear yellow in color. It poured with a short white head that quickly died down and completely faded away.
S: Moderate aromas of ginger are present in the nose—just like you were sniffing the fresh ginger that you get as an accompaniment to sushi.
T: Much like smell, the taste has lots of moderate flavors of ginger. Neither sweetness nor bitterness are perceptible.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer tastes like a ginger ale without the sweetness. It is quite flavorful for a shandy."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.44,"330ml single bottle, procured at my favorite down-market 'bottleshop' in E-town.

This 'beer' pours a clear, pale golden amber colour, with one (I think) finger of fizzy soda-pop 'head', which predictably wisps away just as fast as you can look at it, leaving nothing resembling lace near the glass.

It smells of sharp, edgy, and duly spicy ginger root, middling caramel notes, and a gritty sugarcane sweetness. The taste is much more of the same - rather sweet, syrupy sugar, tinted with a burnt caramel/toffee essence, still perky and peppy natural spicy ginger, an echo of actual indistinct malt, and a mild herbal astringency, very much like those Caribbean bitters.

The bubbles are barely adequate, more like the kind that remain in a bottle of cola left in the fridge for three days, the body a deceptive medium weight, as all that extra sugar has to go somewhere. It finishes well, sweet, in a rather saccharine sense, the ginger holding on, much as it would in the associated soft drink.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is sweet like soda, low alcohol, and yet pretty gingery. This all may be a bit confusing, but I'd take this in a heartbeat over any actual 'ginger ale', as all other things being equal, the minor ABV and heady ginger root notes make this a winner. A winner for Canadian grocery stores, that is, and not as a 'lager beer', as they've so brazenly plastered on the label."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.55,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass

A: Pours very very light yellow, good finger and a 1/2 of white head that settles to nothing... no lacing at all... Looks very flat, no carbonation at all.

S: Ginger ale, a little caramel and lots of sweet sugar. (Is this beer ??)

T: Just like the smell, straight up ginger ale, hint of caramel... very sweet... not beer like at all.

M: Light bodied, no carbonation, but leaves a sugary sticky feel in the mouth.

D: Lets be honest this is not a beer, it is ginger ale with a touch of alcohol... Run away."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.73,"12 oz.

Pours the color of ginger ale with a soda pop white head that dissipates to nothing immediately. Bubbles can be seen effervescing.

Smells strongly of spicy ginger and sugar cane sweetness, with maybe a hint of apple juice.

Tastes like ginger beer (ginger ale that has the sting from the ginger) with only the faintest whisper of beer malts at the very end. Sugary sweet.

Feels medium thick, sticky and very bubbly.

Well...this is a soft drink. It's a ginger ale. They mixed a bit of lager into it, I guess, but you would have no idea. If you poured this into a Canada Dry bottle, you would fool 99 out of a 100 people."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.35,"I found this single, clear, 12oz bottle at the Binny's store in Plainfield, IL for $1.99. There are a couple different flavors of Carib Shandy - this is the ginger version. The label says it is a blend of lager beer with natural ginger flavor and caramel color.

The beer poured a crystal clear pale gold color with lots of carbonation bubbles, but it only made a thin white rim for a head that completely disappeared within 20 seconds and left no lacing.

The only smell this beer gives off is that of the ginger plant. No beer smell to it at all.

This tastes like ginger ale. No hint of hops or malts or any trace of the lager beer that the label claims is in here. It's a very sweet ginger ale soda. It doesn't taste terrible for a ginger ale, but as a beer it's not very good.

Medium body with a just less than heavy soda-like carbonation.

At 1.2% abv you can drink a ton of these before feeling anything, but it's really too sweet to enjoy more than 1 or 2. People who don't like beer might like this, but if you're a serious beer drinker you'll pass on this one."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.28,"Blend of lager beer with natral ginger flavour and caramel calour...right there I feel bad for Carib's creativity team. APpears like ginger ale, the nose seems spicy lacking the average ginger ale notes it really smells like fresh ginger. Earthy/spicy ginger notes with layers of sweet candy cane going on. I'm sorry before I get heartburn or see someone burnt on this I have to get rid of it. The back of my throat burns like I just purre'd some ginger., but this beer is horrible. It's like ginger ale that heats up your nostrils because of fresh ginger, my brother might love this...in addition it cures nausea."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.7,"A: Pours a completely transparent straw color. Head is small, white, and retention is terrible (lasting only a second or two)

S: Fresh ginger snaps greet the nose immediately. Strongly resembles ginger ale, with much more residual sweetness. But everything in this nose points to ginger; fresh, crisp, and sweet

T: Wow, really really different. I was expecting a light ginger touch to Carib, but this is crazy. HUGE sweetness in the flavor, alongside fresh ginger, ginger snaps, and some light malts. Not really balanced at all, but still interesting, and I don't mind this.

MF/D: Medium body, basically no carbonation, lingering sweet/sugary ginger finish."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.32,"I had out of a 12 ounce bottle.
A- Gold, completely see-through. No head or lacing. It's bubbly, very bubbly.
S- EXTREMELY pungent. Smells like ginger cider. Actually, smells exactly like ginger ale.
T- It tastes exactly like ginger ale. It's an alcoholic ginger ale, except you don't taste the alcohol. I don't know if that is what most beer drinkers are looking for, but what ever. Some what spicy aftertaste."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,3.67,"From a clear 12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very sweet an of ginger. Tastes like ginger ale, maybe even sweeter. Feels light and bubbly in the mouth and is highly drinkable. An interesting idea for a flavored beer, I think Carib pulls it of well."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.65,"Best by Nov 09:

Pours same light brown/caramel that is visible through the clear glass bottle. Some loud fizz of a head immediately disappears. No lacing.

The smell is of arificial sweetener with ginger. Smells like sweetened tonic water with ginger-flavoring.

The taste is sickly sweet - sugar sweetness as in the ""malt beverages"" way. Ginger flavor is there, but not in much of a spicy way, so it adds flavor, but not much balance to the sweetness. Sweetness lingers.

Light-bodied, a bit sticky. Not too fizzy for what it could be.

Drinkable to a point if you waant a sweet ginger flavored drink that has little to no resemblance to beer. Other than carbonation, where is the ""lager"" part of this? Not sure that this belongs in the ""beer"" section as much as in the malt beverage section. Wasn't so easy to finish. Bland other than the ginger, and way too sticky sweet."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.26,"Appearance: Pours a clear, dull, pale gold body with a thin, white head.

Smell: Ginger aroma. As with the previous Carib Lime, it comes across as highly artificial and highly unpleasant.

Taste: Grimace-inducing sweetness with a ginger flavor. Slight burn on the tongue from the ginger (or my taste buds are self-destructing). No real malt or hops detectable -- basically, it's just a malternative. Sweet finish that lasts and lasts.

Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. There's a sticky sugary quality to the mouthfeel, much like a cheap store brand soda.

Drinkability: Difficult to finish. AVOID."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.5,Pours a clear light gold copper color that looks like ginger ale. No head or carbonation. Smells like ginger furniture polish but sweeter. First sip is sugary sweet with no beer flavor able to be detected. Too sweet for even a ginger ale let alone an adult beverage. Avoid...unless you have dirty cabinets that want to smell like a side dish on a sushi platter.
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.25,"The lable states that this is a ""blend of lager beer with natural ginger flavour and caramel colour"". I get the color part, but I don't get the lager part.

The beer is a true 'ginger' ale. There are really no characteristics in the taste, nose, appearance, or texture that resemble beer. But that doesn't keep this concoction from becomming a complete disaster.

The ginger, sugary sensation hits up front in the nose and holds on to all the senses from there on out. No hops, no malt, no real estery profiles, phenols... nothing. Just ginger all the way.

Still pleasant, refreshing, and crisp- even if in a soda-pop kinda way. This beverage is unique enough to put into it's own beverage genre like the ciders, pere, and meads do.

I'm glad I tried it, but it's not what I'll go for when really wanting a beer."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.59,"Not impressed. I don't know if this is old, but the BBD on the bottle is 6/09, but it looks really flat.

A: Crystal clear gold color with no carbonation to be seen. No head, no nothing except liquid to look at. At least it doesn't have things floating in it.

S: Very heavy on the ginger with a lot of caramel to back it up. Some bad corn malts are in there as well. The only thing saving this category for it is that the ginger is very strong and it smells kinda good.

T: Nothing impressive. Very gingery and malty. Has a sweet context to it. Leaves a fructose taste behind.

M: Light bodied, no carbonation and leaves a sugary feel in the mouth. Like you just ate a lollipop.

D: This is a beer for if you are having a sugar crave. Will do the same thing as eating a handful of rolos, only probably not as fattening. Couldn't drink it on a regular basis, tastes more like a wine cooler."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.9,The aroma is like you would imagine a ginger ale would smell like if it were mixed with a cheap Caribbean lager. There is definitely ginger as well as skunky corn malt and latex. The appearance is almost clear but pale gold. .The flavor is more like a ginger ale than a beer but there is definitely some lager in there. The palate is thin and prickly. The finish is definitely malt with a sweet chemical cleanness and ginger. Overall a really strange beer.
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,1.45,"It really looks just like a glass of ginger ale, minus all the bubbles fizzing to the top. Its a clear yellow brown color with no trace of head. Smells horrific. I really felt like their should have been a warning sign on the side of the bottle stating that this was a chemical or waste and you could not drink it. It tasted like the syrup of ginger ale from a fountain machine. Too sweet. Mouthfeel was bad. Drinkability was bad."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.91,"Drank while on holiday in Tobago and enjoyed on a very hot, sunny afternoon sat near the pool.

Clear 275ml bottle, best before Dec 2008, drank Jun 2008. Poured into a cooled half pint tumbler it appeared a dull gold, light amber colour, but no head, hence the low score for looks.

The smell was all about ginger, well what did you expect?

Ginger was also the overiding flavour within the taste.

It has a strange warm ginger feel, but refreshing and cooling as well, it was just what I needed at the time and my scores reflect that (with some common sense too)."
Worst,Carib Ginger Shandy,2.38,"My mother brought this one back from her cruise, she tries :) Anyway I grabbed this one from the fridge and poured it into a pilsner glass. Crystal clear with a good amount of carbonation coming up, but no head at all and no side glass lace either. Color was a slightly orange hay color, but still had that macro lager death look. The smell was sickingly sweet with a gingerale type smell, maybe a hint of grain, but I really thought this was a soda to be honest, at least from the smell. The taste was well horrible. It tasted like seagrems gingerale. Soo sugary sweet that I could not even find anything else in it to describe. Very light bodied with huge carbonation, these were probably the only only redeeming factors. But still the taste was so off setting that it still was not even remotely drinkable. I am guessing people drink this kinda like the chill or something. A very light refrshing ale, but the flavor leaves alot to be desired."
Worst,Tiger Beer,3.03,"Pours a slightly cloudy, pale golden coloratrion with a medium, frothy, quickly receding head and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of light crackery malt and grassy hops, with hints of honey. Taste is a decent balance of light crackery, grainy malt and grassy, slightly floral hops, with hints of honey and straw. Finishes with a light bitterness and some grassy hops and honey lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium/strong carbonation.

I'm not saying that this is a great beer, but for what it is, it actually came as a pretty positive surprise to me. Maybe it's because I'm having this rather fresh, but it's quite a crisp, refreshing lager that goes down easy in the sweltering heat. It may not be all that flavourful, but what do you expect from a Euro Lager? Certainly better than any AAL I've ever had, while it's not overly sweet, with some decent, grassy, floral hops and a light bitterness noticeable in the finish. Pretty light-bodied for the ABV though."
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.61,"Exactly what you would expect of a mass produced lager… little flavor, little aroma, no head, looks more like a Pilsner. The label says full -bodied… I can’t find the body"
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.88,"Clear, yellow appearance, fast fading head, no lacing. Sweet, malty, vegetal aroma. Crisp, fairly clean (as long as it stays chilled) corn taste with a miniscule hop presence. Light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel leading to a short lived finish."
Worst,Tiger Beer,3.2,"This is meh. Would probably rate higher but the best before date was TWO FUCKIN YEARS AGO.
For the style it looks fine, minus the lack of carbonation. I think my local hooch shop kept this one around for too long. Golden yellow with absolute minimal carbonation. Minimal head, less than a finger with no lacing. Feel was kind of.. flat. Seriously. Like almost old soda flat, but that may just be the age. Flavor was better than the smell. Smells like old tin and old corn still in the husk. Flavor was slightly interesting for the style, slight corn pungence and sweetness. Slightest of hops ever. Not bad really, but the flatness killed it. If this would have not been expired and flat, might not have been bad. Bud it isnt good."
Worst,Tiger Beer,4.79,"11.2oz bottle poured into Teku glass. Picked up from grocery store as part of an $11 sixer mixer. BEST BY: AUG-2022 printed in black box on bottom of back label. So this is going to be good for another 8 months.

Appearance - Ultra clear gold body. Big tight soapy white head. 4.75

Smell - Corny malt. A memory from when I was a kid and I dreamed I ate some purple soup that smelled and tasted like this. 5

Taste - Corny malt. Just a bit of hop to keep things balanced and interesting, but not really on the forefront. 4.75

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, though it says 'full bodied' on the packaging. Fairly smooth, but has a little more sharpness than the nose would suggest. Pretty balanced though. Clean finish. 4.5

Overall - Refreshing. Drinkable. Easy. Not super boring like most light lagers. Actually pretty good. Like a good euro lager but without the skunkiness. Maybe the brown bottle helps? Really good for the style. I have to say it feels weird giving a beer like this such high scores, but I am rating it within the style, and not as a beer in general. Though it is pretty decent and I think would make for some great food pairings. 4.75"
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.92,"I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario 500ml at 5%.

Worst,Tiger Beer,2.94,"Notes from 2002: For an Asian beer, this is not too bad. Far more flavour than e.g. Thailand's Singha. I've never been to Singapore *(now I've been to the airport!), but can imagine Tiger Beer would be great in the the tropical heat there. So leave the Singapore Gin Sling for the chicks - be a Tiger!"
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.59,"Tiger Asian Lager is crystal clear and pale amber in color, pretty much the color of ripe hay. The head is rocky, bone white, and surprisingly lasting for the style.
At first blush, Tiger's aroma is sweet and appropriately malty for a pale lager. Meaning it's pale grains combined with crackers and a general sort of breadiness. There's also an up front sweetness that at first seems generic in its sugariness. Then, the center comes along and confirms the presence of corn adjuncts. The sweetness literally reminds me of corn syrup. The finish is also short and sweet, fading quickly into nothing.
My first impression is of a beer that is smooth and rounded, but that impression doesn't last long. It quickly becomes sweet with flavors of corn syrup that thankfully stops short of being cloying. There may be a hint of soda cracker in there, but the corn adjuncts make it hard to pick out. As with the aroma, the flavor ends on a sweet note.
It could be a half decent lager but the corn adjuncts dominate too much to the beer's detriment. If it even had some dryness in its flavor profile that would help cut the beer's overall sweetness. But sadly, no such luck."
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.94,"330ml bottle, best before July 2021. Poured into a tulip.

Smell: a little sweet, a touch of malt, some graininess and a touch of grass.
Taste: honey, malt, a little grain, slightly grassy and herbal hop.
Feel: light but not watery. Some tingly carbonation around the front of the palate, a rounding bitterness with a dry finish.
Overall: not super flavoursome, but quite refreshing."
Worst,Tiger Beer,2.1,"Depending on where do you get the beer from. Most draught in South East Asia bars serves ""flat"" tigers (which is weird since local beers are usually better taste than imported due to freshness etc). Bottles and cans which IMO is slightly better. Still, I'll only have it when choices are limited"
Worst,Tiger Beer,3.23,"Drank from 640ml bottle. Look is see through light copper, minimal head but decent retention. Hefty waft of sweet cereals on the nose. Taste is stale malts and sparking water, next to no hop presence. Feel is high carbonation with a dry crisp finish spoiled slightly by a buttery off note at the back of the throat. It's not bad for what it is which is an adjunct filled macro lager."
Worst,Tiger Beer,3.51,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is a mix of mustiness, graininess and some sweeter caramel. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a light peach and apricot sweetness.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter caramel and an almost candy corn like sweetness with some lighter bready flavors. These tastes create the bulk flavor of the brew and remain rather strong throughout. The sweetness does transition a bit however, gaining some more honey and candy corn like flavors at the expense of the caramel. All the while, there is a touch of herbal hop and a small transitioning of the bready to a more doughy taste, leaving one with a sweeter, but pleasant and still crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to slightly lighter with a carbonation level that is rather average. While a bit more carbonation may have been slightly more fitting for the sweeter tastes, the medium body and feel is great for the flavor profile, and makes for one nice easy drinker.
Overall – A brew fit for a nice hot summer day. Easy drinking, slightly sweeter, and still rather refreshing. Nice overall."

Apparently I need to say more and more and more and more, I have nothing more to say so I am blah blah blahing right now, is this enough word to describe a run of the mill ice lager??!"
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.39,"Tallboy can from TBS; packaged in August 2012. Lucky review #7 in a series detailing various widely-available pale lagers that I've neglected to review or even try for one reason or another. I am always a little hesitant to pick up any beer whose name ends with ""ice"", but for the benefit of consumer knowledge I am willing to risk life, limb, and perhaps even liver. There's no claim on the label of this being ""premium"" (or even a lager) anymore - I can only assume that even the marketing department had trouble convincing themselves it was a legitimate use of the term.

Pours a deep golden-yellow colour, generating nearly two finger's worth of fizzy, frothy white head. I am, of course, not surprised to see it fizzle away before my very eyes, but at least it manages to leave behind a soapy ring around the edge, and a thin cap at the surface rather than evaporating totally. Decidedly unpleasant aroma, even for the style - lots of corn syrup sweetness, grainy malts, and a whiff of solvent.

Unfortunately, the flavour isn't all that appealing either, with the solvent/fusel notes from the nose being even more prominent here. Corny sweetness, pale malts and wet cardboard are the more tolerable tastes near the start of the sip, but these lead into considerably more vegetal, syrupy and boozy notes toward the finish. Sweet aftertaste; pretty boozy for something of 5.5% - that's not enough for the beer to taste hot or anything, but the total vacuum of other prominent flavours in the profile allows the ethanol to blunt-force its way through. Light-bodied and watery, with relatively high carbonation - although honestly, I would prefer it a little higher, to help scrub away the off-flavours. Not very difficult to consume quickly, and I reckon you probably should, because this is not the kind of beer that improves as it warms.

Final Grade: 2.4, a D+. Laker Ice is OK by 'ice beer' standards, but disappointing by adjunct lager standards (as low of a bar as that is). I'd probably take this over Carling Ice, Old Milwaukee Ice or Labatt Maximum... but if I'm setting the bar that low in the first place, I'd rather have a regular adjunct lager. Regular Laker might not be a very good lager, but its big brother here is straddling the line between tolerable and unappealing.

I'm honestly surprised at how much of a difference 0.5% abv can make - I have no real problem with standard Laker or Carling; cheap and bland as they are, they are fairly inoffensive. But that extra 0.5 is enough to transform them into beers that approach drain-pouringly bad levels of lameness. If you absolutely need to find a pale lager at 5.5%, I still say James Ready is about the 'best' you can hope for in this price bracket, forget about all this iced garbage."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.96,"I usually pick up a ""Laker"" beer and expect nothing, but I was actually really impressed with Laker Ice.

It has a nice golden colour and a very sweet smell. I was most impressed with the taste. It was very smooth and thin tasting, and had a very high quality taste that could compare to the top tier Ice Lagers. There was no after taste and paired very nicely with nachos.

It smelt bland and there was nothing overly special about the taste. I would like the taste to be a bit more complex, but it makes for a very fast drinking beer."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.41,"473ml Can

Appearance – Clear yellow colour with an average size fizzy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 4 minutes before it was gone.

Smell - Grains, bread, corn, malts

Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation. I can taste malts, grains, and lots of corn. There is also a bit of a floral taste and also an unidentifiable cooked vegetable flavour. It ends with a grainy yet sweet aftertaste.

Overall – To be honest it was really much better than I was expecting. There was a bit of an odd taste to it, but it was in no way undrinkable. Not something I'd buy again, but it went down fast after my hockey game."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,3.84,"This beer i was looking forward to drinking, as i really like ICE beers.

Anyway, grabbed a tallboy can of this from the LCBO, can looks really cool, with ""make'r a laker"" around the top of the can.

Pours out a golden yellow stock macro color with a little .5 inch ring of lace.

Smells nice and fresh, and inoffensive. Pretty good acctually.

Taste is great, goes down smooth, with mild bitterness with a sweetish taste, and finishes with little after taste that doesnt linger.

Mouthfeel was like every other macro, thin and watery.

I could slam these cans all day long, its great, the ABV is just right, and overall i was pleased with this, and I will buy it again, hopefully i see it in bottles. Anyway, try it out."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.48,"Thanks to bobsy for including this as an extra in a trade (I really only wanted it for the can).
Black label with metallic blue maple leaf, Mak'er A Laker, only says Laker Ice, I guess this one isn't the 'Premium Lager'. Brewed by Laker Brewing Company, Rochester NY.

Pours gold color with a foamy white head, actually had decent retention and some thin strings of lace. Sweet grainy smell. Wet grass malt taste, some metallic aftertaste. Tolerable, not as bad as I was expecting, would do in a pinch (Better than anything by Mountain Crest)."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.27,"The can says this is brewed by ""Laker Brewing Company - Rochester NY"". I guess its contract brewed on both sides of the border.

Pours deep gold with a foamy long lasting head that musters up a respectable amount of lace. Sweetish malt with vegetal highlights and some wet grainyness fills the nose. The taste is sweet and limpid. corn and iron flavors are worth noting. Hops offer a mild and coarse bitterness. The finish is sweetish.

Looks nice, but very bland to drink."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.89,"As soon as I saw the words Laker and Ice together, I knew this was going to be a painfull review. The apperance is a little impressive, golden amber with a thick head. The smell is very sweet.

The taste is very sweet and shortly after becomes stale. Very weak aftertaste. If your getting it just for the alcohol, my opinion would be just to get malt liqour. At least you get more alcohol with your poor quality beer."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.96,"Definately the worst of the Laker series. Some malt to start, fizzy carbonation, and then airline fuel and dry finish. Tin metallic aftertaste. Old stale Beer smell, yellow colour, thinnish mouthfeel. Drain pour. CHeap price though, and broken pack at Bayview-Sheppard LCBO."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,1.8,"The third of the teerible""buck a beer"" Brick sodie pops I endured. This is definately the worst so far. Same fizzy, no-head, pale straw colored look. Aroma non existant except for a slight damp cardboard smell....watery, gassy mouthfeel dominated by carbonation and the weak taste of sour vegetal juice....fast finish with no detectable malt or hop presense...this is like a sour veggy soda pop....not to be recommended or taken seriously."
Worst,Laker Ice Premium Lager,2.56,Very pretty brew when poured with a thick crown which quickly disapates leaving a wide island lace and heavy glass ring/cling..Colour is a medium honey gold and very clear..Taste initially is sweet then flattens out..definite malt beverage with limited evidence of hops..nothing special here.
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",3.88,"Taste is some type of acidic, I don't think its from alcholol. I think its better than Tuborg Red (Kırmızı) in terms of drinking experience. Anyway I don't like intense beer so I only buy one of these when I buy like lots of corona and carlsberg and drink this as the last bottle for little bir more alcohol in just one bottle. Definitely not horrible beer tho, you can drink and enjoy this."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.1,"Aroma is sour and musty. Pours wth a nice, thick velvety head (but then again, so does pee from time to time). Flavor is licorice (not in a good way) and cough syrup. This is beer made for getting drunk, if you can get it down."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.17,"Very very very sweet beer. You can get diabetes from this beer. Be careful. The most sugary beer i've ever tasted in my whole life.

I don't recommend this to anyone unless you are a candy addict."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.36,"6,5 ABV version produced by Efes Moldova under supervision by Grolsch Bierbrouwerij N.V.

Much darker in color than a normal euro lager, its color reminded me of peach juice, but with the same clarity you would expect from a lager. Pretty high carbonation can not hide the increased ABV, that feels rather unnatural.
Smell is full of alcohol and faint spices, some fruit too.
Taste is very blunt, some alcohol traces, just your extremely average lager. However, the black can has a lovely design. Anyway, compared to a bottle of Chisinau beer, this one is nowhere near it. Don't get me wrong, Chisinau is a fairly average, yet honest beer. Amsterdam Navigator is not catastrophic by any means, still not good enough. Worth a try only for the sake of trying it, but don't expect any fireworks."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.72,"Shared 500 ml can in Greece.
Appearance: it has an amber-apricot colored body.
The flavor is overly sweet and lacking in hops.
Overall: 8.0% alcohol is partly hidden."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.48,"Now at 8% ABV: my 50cl can was obtained from a supermarket in Ste Maxime on the South of France and poured into two tumblers at my mates holiday villa on 17th Sep 2013 during a 'heavy can tasting evening'.

Good solid gold body with a white, short lived head.

Sweet and syrupy from the moment the can was opened, it was the sweetest by far of the high alcohol cans we tried.

Can't really say much more, some alcohol traces, but even those were masked by the overpowering sweetness of the brew: I normally enjoy malty, sweet brews, but this was too much."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.3,"Got this from a supermarket in Normandy. Says it's a beer ""rich in ingredients"" with a ""long brewing process...""

From a 50cl can into a pint glass.
ABV: 8%

APPEARANCE: Pours a three finger, medium looking, fluffy white head with decent retention. Perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation. Force carbonated. Fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy, chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. Splotchy wisp leaves some lacing down the glass.

SMELL: Mild nose of bread and grain. Light caramel perhaps.

TASTE: Bread and grainy malts to begin, with some sweet grainy malt, some light caramel and some bitter hop at the swallow. Aftertaste is sweet and grainy with caramel and toffee sweetness and just a hint of bitterness. Much like the Admiral but without the hop balance.

PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A little light, goes down fine and finishes slightly sweet on palate. A touch light perhaps.

OVERALL: Not as good as their Admiral. Stronger with more sweet malt flavors, but without the hop bitterness to act as balance. Yeah, there's a lot of flavor, but not flavor that make me want to go back for more."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.73,"We pop the tab and glug out an apple juice colored brew. It puts up a one and a half finger chunky white head showing great retention. This leaves a single thick sheet of lacing as it dissipates. Carbonation appears average, with no haze or sediment noted. The nose is full of adjuncts, flour, biting alcohol, syrupy sugar, and a light nectary hop. Raw vanilla bean, grassy leafiness, and lactics appear on the far back with warmth. Our first impression is that this beer is extraordinarily sweet. The taste opens with cloying sugars hitting hard and hitting fast. It is dextrin and candy-like, with a bit of apple sweetness. It is hard to pick out any other flavoring until the middle, where a floury malt comes in, but this does little to cut the sugars. The end shows more cheap apple quality, but the grain is most apparent here, with adjuncts, bitters, and a big dose of booze. The aftertaste breathes of raw cane sugary, fermented apples, fusel alcohols, and some wheaty wetness. The body is thick, and the carbonation is light to medium. Each sip is puckering to the sweetness, but there is decent sip and froth, and hearty slurp and glug. The abv is appropriate, and the beer is hard to drink.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the appearance. The head actually showed nice retention and color, making the beer seem rather inviting. It really fell apart from there, as the flavoring was intensely sweet. There was actually a benefit to this in that it helped to mask the alcohol pretty well. Other than that it decimated all other traces of flavoring and overwhelmed the drinker."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.5,"Grolsch brewed specialty.

Looks orange golden, thin head, decent lacing in the glass, hardly any carbonation.
Smell of malts, some faint grassy hops. Also flowerscented soap and seaweed.
Taste is completely syruppy sweetness, malts and corn in the background. Hardly any hop.
The 8.4 % isn't too harsh in the mouth, mainly because of the sweetness.
This beer lacks balance and depth."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.47,"500ml can poured in a chalice.

A: Pours a clear golden yellow to orange color with a big white fluffy head. Medium retention and some lacings left

S: A lot of sugar in the nose followed by the caramel malts, some hops and alcohol

T: Too sweet and extremelly syrupy. Some sweet malts but, the sweetness is quite extreme and jeopardizes the taste. End is quite bitter as an unique positive point

M: Heavy and molasses with a reasonable carbonation, a quite bitter aftertaste and a high ABV

D: Low. Again, too sweet and molasses"
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.54,"Had this beer on tap in the Vlaamsche Reus in Wageningen some time ago. I try to write this review as I remember the beer by heart. The beer pours a clear golden-yellow color with a nice thick white head (just like a normal pilsner).

Smell: sweet malts, bit alcoholic, some flowery hops.

Taste: very very sweet, almost like strong liquor (e.g. liquor 43) with malts . Some hints of caramel and a very weak grainy hoppiness in the aftertaste. The beer tastes like sugar is added after the brewing process. Alcohol is quite strong.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied (bit syrupy), although the big head suggested high carbonation, the beer is medium-low carbonated.

Overall: Way to sweet, like most strong Grolsch beers. Not worth trying."
Worst,"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4",2.53,"A-Clear yellow-golden w/thick white head, decent lacing & retention.

S-Slightly sweet toasted malt w/bits of corn and faint red apple.

T-Sweet upfront w/red apple, sweet malt, and faint hops in finish.

M-Cloyingly sweet w/light-to-medium syrupy body and moderate carbonation.

D-Too sweet, and a level under many of the other strong lagers one can buy for the same price."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.44,"Poured from an undated 24oz can. Also does anybody actually know who owns this brand?

On the pour a quite surprising 4 finger, albiet quite fizzy, white head that dissipates down to 2 fingers after a couple minutes. Color is your standard golden yellow straw, and carbonation is fine but active. Some lacing

Smell is generically cheap. Light and dominated by mistreated lager yeast. Not the most disgusting thing, and honestly quite bright smelling, but still not good by any means.

Taste is syrupy and odd. Diacetyl is present and the ""malt"" is intensely sweet and syrupy. There is some actual barley present but it's hiding in the very back. Slightly Metallic as well.

Feel is mouth coating and weirdly flat. Maybe this is an old can but there is still carbonation. Maybe the liquid just chemically couldn't hold carbonation well. Medium long finish that I wish was shorter.

This is a disgrace to market as a pilsner. Once G. Heileman moved out of La Crosse and City Brewing took over just figuring out who owns what, and even what beer comes out of that brewery is a nightmare. About the only good City brewing beer I've had was montucky cold snacks and that was just a decent lager. This on the other hand is a cheap disgrace. I'd rather drink colt 45. And to be honest with you the lost lake website says this is higher ABV but I'm not sure if it's a typo because the listed abv is the same as the Ice version, and it really seems like they just don't care."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.38,"I got a 24pck of this beer from the Woodman's in La Crosse, WI whilst moving my daughter to school. It poured a clear golden with no head and no lace. The scent had grain notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with good biscuit like presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.02,"$4.49 USD plus tax per sixer of 12 fl oz pull-tab cans at a shitty liquor store (Poindexter Liquor) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

""Naturally brewed pilsner beer.""

Off the first sip, I'm calling bullshit on the ""pilsner"" designation. This is very clearly an adjunct lager...it's immediately obvious.

A biteen syrupy. Driven by a deeply off-putting creamed corn sweetness. Cheap 6-row lends more generic malt sweetness.

A bit metallic. Certainly too sweet. Lacks any balancing hop character.

I won't get into its lack of any Noble hop character or pilsner malt since it'd be disingenuous...it ain't a pilsner, it's a budget adjunct lager.

But even as a budget adjunct lager it's pretty bad, to be honest. I often find myself defending the Coors Banquets and Miller High Lifes of the world, but I can offer no such effort with respect to this...it's bad and generic, with obvious imbalance and no redeeming characteristics.

Even on a budget beer basis, it comes up short against Ballantine XXX, the less repungant malt liquors, and many mainstream adjunct lagers (Schlitz Gusto, Coors Banquet, Rolling Rock, Miller High Life, hell even Budweiser - yes, I said it).

This is in that weird market segment of budget lagers brewed by generic sounding corporate conglomerates by shell companies in Wisconsin (this one is ""brewed"" by ""Universal Sales, Inc., La Crosse, WI"" - I'm sure that's a down-home operation run by passionate former homebrewers...), and even in that unenviable cohort it's a loser of a beer.

I feel like I need to wear a wifebeater and have a ball game on (with maybe some casual child abusing thrown in) to be able to ""appreciate"" this beer.

Low D / NOT RECOMMENDED"
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.28,"Pleasantly surpised with this one.

L- Light golden/yellow....clear...a lot of carbonation bubbles.

S-Dry, tingling pomegranate, Australian red licorice

T- Full-bodied, this delivers bold notes of coffee bean and kola nut, along with red pepper on the back of the palate before a long, leathery, caramelized conclusion. An overture of flavors that’s at times heavy and rich with notes of dark chocolate and wood, and other times, subtle and understated with hints of fine caramel and toasted almonds.

F-Highly carbonated...clean....no off flavors.

O-Not what I was expecting but wow is this loaded with flavor for a basic AAL."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.79,"I am slowly getting around to reviewing & rating beers for The CANQuest (tm) that caused my local, in-person some CANsternation since I was not getting to them quickly enough. Fair dinkum, but fear no longer, @tone77 , there is movement!

From the CAN: ""Made with natural ingredients. Serve cold.""

Made with natural ingredients?!? When has a beer, other than a Minhas product, been made with unnatural ingredients?!? This does NOT bode well!

I Crack!ed open the vent & held my breath, hoping for the best but girding for the worst. The Glug revealed a gorgeous Golden-Amber colored (SRM = > 5, < 7) beer with NE-quality clarity, calling forth The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus for a taste. They had to wait until the just-better-than-a-finger of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white had subsided to get at it. Nose was not bad, kinda grainy trending towards wheat, but seemingly adjunct-free. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, mere steps above wateriness. The taste was just too sweet, but not metallic or adjunct-ridden. What?!? No discernible Noble hops in a Pilsner?!? 8=( Finish was semi-sweet, but more bland than anything else. This one simply lacked Ooomph! YMMV."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.19,"Im going to be honest, if you’re struggling with cash and need to get a quick Buzz, 2 tallboys if these will get you. The taste is more tolerable than most, it feels good when it hits your gut and it’s easily drinkable. Highly smooth too."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.86,"Not a great beer but good for what it is. That is a cheap AAL. More body than you might expect. Clean dry taste, nothing offensive. I have paid more for worse."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.74,"Taste: slight hop, mellow thin, not much zip. Mild grain nose.Gold, clear, with white soapy head and delicate lace. Lite body. A boating beer that closer to a lite beer."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,1.87,"Look - Ok, to be honest... my rating of the look is not very objective. I know this beer well, yet, I bought a 24 oz. can (for $1.15, nonetheless) just to have a fresh take on the review, but having had this before, when I pour it out, it looks kind of like they bottled the urine of a dehydrated 95 year old man.

Smell - Trying to be a little objective here. Smells sweeter than I'd like, lots of mixed in adjunct aromas. A little bit of malt.

Taste - Not the worst beer I've ever had, but definitely on the low end. It tastes kinda like an anxiety attack... Ok, it's not that bad. The flavor on the initial draw into the mouth isn't that different from a macro American Adjunct Lager, but the lingering flavors and aftertaste seem more like the metallic powder used to exacerbate the yeild of high explosives... Ok, it's not that bad.

Feel - Light and watery.

Overall - Yes, I have been heavy handed in this review, but do not let that scare you away from this beer. This beer holds a special place in my heart. It is what I call a ""Party Beer"" (but not a frat party beer). This is the kind of beer that the college guy in the studio apartment buys for a party because he's very poor (yeah, that was me). It's not great, but it is serviceable when needed. Really, it's not THAT bad, but I'm making this review based on comparison... and by comparison, this beer falls quite short of others on flavor and quality."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.29,"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn, grains. Taste is malts, corn, grains, a touch sweet, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer, and at $1.25 for a 24 oz. can, it's a good value as well."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,4.5,"I'm giving this beer a high score to counter so many of the low scores. People who give this beer a low score don't understand this type of beer. It's not in the same category as an expensive German pilsner, and so can't be judged the same way. This beer is a cheap American beer. It's not pretending to be anything else. It's a drunkard's beer, and it's one of the best drunkard beers on the planet, IMO. If you wanna get wasted, and fast, this is the beer for you. One caveat: if you drink it too fast (too many in a row, too quickly), it will make you sick. The alcohol in this beer sneaks up on you, and when it hits it hits hard. Drink one, wait a few/ten minutes, then drink another. If you wanna get drunk, you won't be disappointed. And for all those people pouring this beer into a glass and complaining about the head/aroma: Again, you don't understand. This is not a pour-beer - it's a drink-from-the-can beer. It's the beer you drink while watching Winter's Bone. Or after your girlfriend dumped you. Or your dad died. Or you killed someone, or life just sucks and you wanna get wasted. It's not a brew to be ""appreciated""; it's a brew to get ""appreciwasted""."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,3.5,"This is actually a really nice beer. It's not the same 'chug it ice-cold for a great buzz' stuff as Natty Ice. You can actually enjoy the flavor, if pilsners are your thing. It has some interesting flavor and mouth-feel, but it's clean and refreshing, too. Pleasant, but not overpowering or skunky."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.91,"Pours to a sudsy head that goes away. Light golden color and filtered clarity. Aroma is weak and grainy, not much there. Flavor is just about the same but clean and nonoffensive. Mouthfeel is light and clean. A so-so beer for a fantastic price. You could spend more and do worse."

I picked up a 6 pack of lost lake.
Not much taste at all smells somewhat like beer.
Mostly sweet taste
Moderate carbonation.
Drinkable, but that's about it.
Dry not a bad after taste.
Won't buy anymore. But if I'm at a friend's house and they offer I won't turn it down."
Worst,Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,2.18,"Reviewed from notes.

Poured out of the can a pale clear pilsner yellow color with a two finger head that dissolves back to a thin collar in about half a minute with absolutely no lacing at all. Smells mostly metallic and partially of sweet corn and tastes about the same as it smells. Carbonation is jacked way too high on a thin watery body, it makes me constantly have to belch even just sipping it.

Well....at least it wasn't skunky in any way and it was cheap. I suppose that's good enough for certain circumstances. (post yard-work thirst comes to mind)"
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,5,"Well, it's 2022.
With beer prices up 35%, I refuse to be gouged by breweries just to have a cold one.
And, I've gotten over brewpubs that don't properly carbonate their beers starting at $6 a pint.
This stuff has an alcohol content of 6.7% , an IBU of 79, and costs $4.99 for a 6 pack.
Bingo!

PS

I drink beer to cool off in the summertimeand get a nice buzz at the same time, not have a mouthgasm.
When I drink a beer, I don't use phrases like ""banana and clove in abundance"" to describe it.
A good loud burb will suffice."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,3.11,"Definitely not an AIPA, but as an English ESB, not bad. I am not getting the metallic or medicinal taste that others have, but the bitterness of both the amber malt and the hops makes it taste like an amber ale. Absolutely worth the price for students looking for something other than PBR or Coors. They should look into brewing a Mild, just get rid of these hops, they don't add to the flavor one bit."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.34,12oz can from Trader Joe's. Light amber pour with a short-lived fizzy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Taste is also malty with metallic notes. Taste like you're licking the can.
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1.06,Honestly one of the more disgusting beers I have ever tasted--medicinal like a cleaning product. So bad I am taking the time to look up and contribute my own review. Returning the rest of the 6 pack to Trader Joe's tomorrow. I hope the smell and taste fade sooner than later not to mention my upset stomach from just a few sips.
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,3.02,From can.. $4 and change six pack at Trader Joes (Rhinelander Brewing Company} -Smell is good -appearance is a little cloudy for an Ameican IPA -Feel ..i didn't enjoy holding in mouth for long .. on the slightly hoppy side with balanced malt ....decent enough for the price.
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.89,"trader joes pickup, they really do a good job with variety and weird proprietary stuff, always have, super under the radar i reckon, but its neat to know i can roll in here anytime and find something ive never had before that might only be available in their stores, and the price is always right. this was under a buck for the single i think, thankfully, because its not worth any more than that, thats for sure. its real malty, almost tastes like an extract brew rather than an all malt one, which is shocking really for something marketed as craft, at first i was kind of bummed about it, but my wife pointed out that if you consider it like a malty english pale rather than an american ipa, it has some redeemable qualities. the grain is nutty and sweet, amaretto and light brown sugar character, caramelized some, and the hops are more aromatic than flavorful, there is just a moderate late bitterness that comes in, decidedly old school in terms of recipe, and pretty uninspired to me. it has a very weird aftertaste, chemicals and malt extract, syrupy feel but with some bubbles too, fine to try i guess as something new, but i wont be back for more of this. hoping the others in the lineup are better, ill get around to trying them all eventually. as a budget beer this might work for some in a certain context, but smack in the middle of fresh hop season in northwest this is an embarrassment..."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,3.06,"12oz can no date, just a stupid code

Hard pour, big foam, amber-orange and clear, some very pretty lacing left on the glass. Smells like rust water and alcohol. Tastes like heavy malts and aromatic bittering hops. Pine is the defining hop characteristic, but there's not a ton of it, this is mostly a malt bomb apart from the bitterness

This isn't for the west-coast hop heads - more of an old-head classic representative of the style. And at $5 a sixer, how can you even begin to be critical?!"
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1,Prominent hand sanitizer flavor with notes of old varnish & rancid malt. Not sure I even want to cook with this. Positive marks: the can makes for good recycling.
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1.73,"They're calling this an American IPA and not a Northwest / West Coast or New England IPA, and selling a pack of six for a measly 5 bucks... so maybe I can forgive the disappointing lack of hops in both smell and taste.

What I can't forgive is the awful nose and the very off-putting after-taste that accompanies this beer. This is one of the worst and weirdest IPAs I've ever tried. It's overly malty for an IPA, too sweet, unpleasantly sour, and the after taste is aptly described by other reviewers as ""medicinal.""

The high alcohol content may have some medicinal effects, but that's about it. This is the first TJ's beer I've tried and I may not be trying many more after this one."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1.2,"I feel like boatswain is best avoided and has become a hit/miss grocery outlet special... more often hit than miss.

Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1.93,"Drank from a 12 ounce can.

Appearance: light honey color, 3/4” head, some lacing.

Smell: subtle clove.

Taste: clove.

I did not enjoy. Not IPA-ish. I would not purchase again."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,3.08,"355ml Can from California as a gift:
Dark, caramel amber with a clear body & a 0.5cm, foamy & off-white head with some lacing. The nose is strong but not overly hoppy, some caramel sweetness & biscuit malts helping with the balance then some citrus following on behind. The taste is a little unbalanced with a few malts & bitter hops again then an unusual sweetness that didn't really work well. The beer is well-carbonated & sharp but it was definitely missing something too."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.25,"Not good. Definitely not an IPA. Found this one at Trader Joe’s. No date on can. Started off OK, nice amber honeyed color with a little fluffy white head and very minimal spotty lacing. Smell was all wrong though - Belgian yeast, clove, wheat, heavy malt, raisin. No hops or anything even close to it. Tastes similarly, just heavy on the malt and yeast. Where’s the hoppiness? Thin mouthfeel and only decent carbonation. I felt very misled by the label on this beer."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.71,"This has a nice bronze color, but very little head or lacing. It smells too strong, sort of bitter medicine and yeast. It tastes a little better than it smells, with a strange malt and yeasty hops mix. The mouth feel is ok - smooth with a little burst of carbonation. My second of these, poured in a glass was better than the first straight from the can, but it is still probably my least favorite IPA ever tried. Pass on this."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.15,"Appearance: Pours a deep amber orange color with a mild white head. SRM of 14 (3.75)

Aroma: Strong orange and medicine aromas. Lots of clove, medicinal aspirin as I have gotten with all of Minhas beers. It's just orange tangerine and aspirin. (3.00)

Flavor: Flavor follows the nose with even more clove and drying medicinal flavors. Resembles Belgian yeast. Orange upfront, but then get walloped up by the medicinal quality. Finishes dry, medicinal, and bitter. (2.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Thick and low carbonation. Leaves a medicinal and spice bitterness on the palate. Not very pleasant. (2.00)

Overall: Good God this is a terrible beer. Definitely should not be called an ""IPA"". All of the beers from this brewery have this orange, medicinal quality and taste the same. This one is just stronger. Not a pleasant flavor. The appearance is the only redeeming quality of this beer. A beer that's ranked #6836 of the American IPA category should not be called an IPA. I think I could stir some hops and malts together and put it in a microwave and get a better product than this. (Final Rating: 2.15)"
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.8,"Clear amber with thin head. Smells of sweet crackery malt with hint of spicy hops. Flavor is similar, kind of toasty. Definitely more malt forward than hop forward. I can't rate this as an AIPA, as it doesn't fit the profile at all. It's more like an english bitter. The bitterness is a strong component of the experience, yet still not very bitter for an IPA. It's dirty and metallic and lingers in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin, even watery. Medium-high carbonation."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,1.35,"I joined BA just so I could review this beer. This stuff is the kind of beer you bring to party when obligated to do so, and you really don’t like the host. It is literally the worst “IPA” that I’ve ever had. It’s no IPA. If the ABV is what attracts you (some have said so), save your taste buds and just hit some Tequila shots and be done with. Don’t tell another serious beer drinker that you drink this. You’ll instantly lose all respect."

MONROE WI 53566.""* Purchased at Trader Joe's; poured from a can into a pint glass. It's quite inexpensive. It's a clear, honey color, with above-average carbonation which causes tiny bubbles to rise continuously from the bottom of the glass. Unremarkable head.

It smells grainy. The taste is so-so, a bit below average. It's fairly bitter due to its hop content, but it also has a prominent woody malt character which doesn't taste fresh to me. A hint of a chemical or plastic taste, bordering on rancid. Compared to the IPAs I imbibe regularly, it's subpar."
Worst,Boatswain American IPA,2.16,"Got swept up by the price and label promising not just an IPA, but an American IPA. Normally my sweet spot. This was neither. Not awful , but when you’re anticipating APA flavors and get this sweet, malty, ESB like mouthful...I may give the other five away."
Worst,Oculto,1.99,"12oz bottle, with a fine layer of dust

Worst,Oculto,2.79,"It sounded good. It looked good, even smelled good. The taste was oversweetened lime juicy funk. I had to force myself to finish the six pack. I think I tried pouring tequila in it and adding a lime and that didn't help a damn bit. Awful stuff."

So I your a great beer drinker you find the good in mostly everydrink. Unless it's a 4 loko those are the worst. Ocultos was talking over the top beers. Way better than budlight and America beers.
Worst,Oculto,4.88,I don't know why so many people are leaving horrible reviews. I absolutely loved this beer and think it was genius to brew in tequila barrels. Abita brew does the same only with bourbon barrels and those fly off the shelves. Perhaps it's a cultural thing as most of the people I know who loved it as much as I do were Latinos. I wish it wasn't taken off shelves and Anheuser-Busch would consider putting them back-at least in the high Latino community stores.
Worst,Oculto,4.1,Not a bad hybrid beer for what it is. Not a craft effort. It reminds me of Corona. I taste a little Tequila flavor. Good beer for a summer day. I recommend drinking this beer with a thick slice of lime. This compliments the beer. I liked it especially with lime. Worth picking up on a summer day.
Worst,Oculto,2.13,"REALLY wanted to love this. Bottle art kicks ass, but that was where my love affair ended. Smells sweet with notes of lime, sweetness that I think must be the infusion of blue agave that the label states. The colder the better, as it kills the sweetness. Did not detect any tequila, which was another disappointment because the label hinted otherwise. Would be a good beer for people who aren't beer fans. A nice halfway point between beer and wine coolers. Will probably try again though, might be a better summer beer."
Worst,Oculto,3.41,"Basically it's a great beer for starting a day out in the summer sun. You don't want to drink too much of it, and the first few sips are very refreshing. Outside of that it's not a beer you want too much of. It's not bad. Just specific.

Look: Very nice clear golden color. But not much head for a 6% lager. It could be that my bottle is a few months old so I will give that a pass.
Smell: Sweet, and sort of smoky
Taste: Sweet at first but then gets a little strangely smoky, sweet and tangy. The taste itself is fine but the aftertaste lingers for a while and is not the most pleasant.
Feel: nice and crisp mouthfeel. Might be a bit bubbly for some but I enjoy it."
Worst,Oculto,2.43,"Nice appearance in the glass, which is by far the best attribute of this beer. Not much going on with the aroma. I picked up some odd flavor characteristics, so I tried it again following a neutral palate cleanser. A little better, but still sweet with a fruity tang and an astringent finish. Tastes like it spent some time on fresh-cut wood, and there isn't a trace of tequila in it."
Worst,Oculto,3.83,"Take a Corona but smooth the taste, let it develop a wood barrel accent and finish it off with a great tequila finish.

Taste Rating in Words: If a beer fell asleep while taking a long relaxing stay in a big, wood, hot tub, full of tequila.

Note: The 3.2% and 6.0% versions of this beer are more different then any other beer I've ever tasted. Color=Different, Taste=Different, Smell=Different. The 3.2% seemed to taste more like Corona (not smooth), followed by a very slight Tequila after taste. While the 6.0% is rated above."
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.98,"355 ml can. Part of Sleeman's mixed 6. Served cold into a pint glass.

Appearance - Pale golden straw colored beer. Good expressive carbonation and a finger plus of head that has some staying power.

Smell - Quite a bit of grainy notes and some cooked veggies. Not unpleasant and more aromatic than expected but doesn't inspire confidence either.

Taste - Strangely flavored, nothing off, but there's not really any grain. Very watery. Not unpleasant but not great either.

Mouthfeel - Clean and somewhat crisp, carbonation is pretty intense, yet there's a sensation of this going down so so easily.

Overall - Better than I thought it'd be, but not great, Gassy but goes down surprisingly easy."
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,3.5,"Medium: Capped, Pils glass.
Opacity: Bright with a faint mist of minerals.
Color: Almost golden with low activity.
Head: Slightly foamy 1-2 finger.
Legs: Decent, okay swirl reaction.
Smell: Cabbage/Minerals.
Taste: Barley/Floral.
Feel: Cereal/Noble hops.
Body: Medium slick.
Carbonation: Prickly.
Overall: Feels like a German Pils, does the job well, not much adjuncts. Pretty good quality, probably the best one they brew.

Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.48,"Regardless of the name on the label, virtually all of Sleeman's core brands look the same. Silver Creek Lager is no different: light yellow in colour, with an antiseptically clean complexion, and bubbles so plentiful yet entirely ineffective that they must be artificial (they can't sustain a proper head).

There's a certain characteristic that from day one I've noted in all Sleeman products; it's especially prominent in the aroma. It's been many years since I've last had an offering of theirs but I still feel confident I could pick them out in a lineup with other mass-produced domestic brand lagers.

Now I realize it must be the brand of corn syrup they use. This sweet, stenchy, skunky note has an industrial ring to it, a synthetic flavour that is markedly different from the wholesome, toasty graininess of actual malted barley. This taste is more like canned corn kernels and is unpleasant, even off-putting.

The one thing I hear in defense of large commercial breweries is that they're consistent; like McDonalds, their beer taste the same everywhere. You always know what you're getting. To replicate a fermented product like beer to the same standards time and time again on a massive scale isn't easy. This is true.

But who wants to make shitty beer? And who wants to drink shitty beer? I tasted my first Silver Creek Lager over a decade ago and it was just as insipid then as it is now. That's an impressive feat but not one I think worthy of commending. Consistency is a good attribute - quality is a better one.

The folks at Sleeman aren't dummies. They've left this recipe the same for good reason: it sells. This lager may be an injustice to the Czech and German ones that originally inspired it but, sorry to say, its bland, sweet, light-bodied and firmly carbonated qualities are exactly what most consumers look for."
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.68,"A: Golden, light, active carbonation. White head.
S: Apple, skunk, corn. Mild.
T: Apple, mild bread, corny. Mild sweetness, pleasant bitterness.
F: Crisp and bright, but just slightly over carbonated.
O: Inoffensive but unremarkable. I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.56,"A - Pale straw colour. Good deal of carbonation. Head fades quickly with no real lacing.

S - A slight skunky smell at the beginning, with an apple scent as well. Almost has a cider-like sweet smell, but not in an appealing sense when I'm about to drink a lager.

T - More of the apple like smell, but the taste is fortunately not as sweet. Slightly bitter aftertaste, though no real hop presence. A bit of a musty taste at the very end as well.

F - Carbonation is appropriate for the style. Fairly crisp and refreshing.

O - Overall slightly unimpressed with this one, not that I had overly high expectations. I think I can say this is my least favourite Sleeman product, and I'm not typically a big fan of the company either. I haven't had the Light or the Original Draught in a while, but from what I remember I enjoyed them both slightly more. However, it is still a serviceable lager that could be consumed in large amounts, and the unappealing factors would likely diminish after the first 2 or 3."
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,3.18,"Sleeman Silver Creek

The look of it: Golden Color, lots of carbonation

The smell: Remind me of the Cream Ale smell. Very corny smell.

The taste: Like the smell, remind me a lot of the Sleeman Cream Ale. Corny, very carbonated. Really enjoy it. Maybe one of my favorite sleeman

So overeall would I recommend ? For sure ! One of the best Sleeman"
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,3.58,"Classic gold colour with a minimal head. Smell is typical of a good lager, bready and maybe a bit hoppy. Taste is clean and crisp, with the usual “Sleeman taste” as I call it. Mouthfeel is a little bland but overall it’s a decent lager.
June 10 2020"
Worst,Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,2.79,"341ml bottle poured into pint glass 12/2/14

A bright yellow liquid with plenty of bubbles but just a short lived thick film that leaves zero lace, looks pretty basic, about what I expected with a little more color

S slightly skunky, a little grass, lemon, apple juice and cracker, nothing special

T has some grassy hops but there's some skunk in there and some bleached paper, not quite offensive but leaves a little something to be desired

M thin but not quite watery, sorta just foams up and flattens out in your mouth, has a bit of a cardboard aftertaste

O it could be much worse but at the end of the day shes just another macro

I was expecting something rank but this was drinkable but nothing worth looking for and I wouldn't buy it again"
Worst,Rock Ice Limon,1.79,"Bought this in Costa Rica to try as a beach drink, which it almost is. There are good versions of this kind of beer when the components are in balance. But somehow this one is too salty. This tastes like some watered-down seawater with a big lime squeezed in, then carbonated. The lime was too low, the salt way too high, and then the carbonation was off. Felt too watery, and not in a refreshing way. I will not be drinking this by the beach later. In Costa Rica, pick yourself up just some regular lager for the beach. I was hoping for SeaQuench. What I got was sea water."
Worst,Rock Ice Limon,2.3,"12 oz can drunk from can

pale yellow (poured a bit to see color)

This is weirdly lemony artificial aroma.

Wow this is werid...yet somehow I almost like it. Salty and acidic, like sour patch kid beer. It's surprisingly refreshing. But no, not a good beer."
Worst,Rock Ice Limon,1.56,"""Thanks"" to flexabull for this killshot from Blind BIF #5.

A: Pours light yellow, lots of fizzy head that quickly subsides. No lacing. By color, I want to assume this is a BMC killshot. Still, the bright yellow isn't entirely unappealing. 3.0

S: What is this, I don't even....hay, cardboard, and lemons, citric acid, limes. Smells a bit like Fresca too. 2.0

T: An odd corny blandness, barely sweet and salty at the same time, as if I were drinking spit. Also slight sourness paralleling the lemons. After some consideration, this tastes like MSG. 1.5

M: I don't know how to describe this. There is a low level sweetness that numbs the side of my tongue. Not too sour, but still cloyingly acidic. 1.0

O: This is slimy. I feel like I'm drinking pre-gargled lemonade. Transport me to a beach, blend this with fruit and vodka, then serve it in a coconut. That's the only way I'd consider drinking more of it. 1.0"
Worst,Rock Ice Limon,1.12,Bottle: Poured a bright golden color lager with a tiny bubbly head with not much retention. Aroma is quite incredibly nasty - 10 times worst then Bug lime or Miller Chill - with loads of of weird lime notes with some salty notes. Taste is foul with loads of off lime notes and a very salty finish. This is not refreshing at all and definitely the worst beer during my stay in CR.
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.43,"250 ml nip bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 4.3%. Cloudy pink colour, big off-white / pale pink head. Strong aroma of raspberry juice and raspberry jam. The flavour is sweet but still refreshing, with plenty of raspberry juice and just a hint of hops. I think they could with advantage have skipped the aspartame and artificial aromatics, though."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.56,"Color: pink. Head white with a pink tinge, fluffy on the surface of beer forms a layer 2 cm.
Aroma: Raspberries, referred to as sweet raspberries and raspberry gently yet.
Taste: Like the aroma of raspberries and nothing else but that does not mean that it is wrong. The beer tastes like raspberry drink perfect, neither too sweet nor too sour, perfect.
Saturation medium, very fit."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.5,"Pink brew, smells of flowers and raspberries. The taste is a bit too sweet for me, and is dominated by raspberries, but it's actually not as bad as I expected. If it's served at a low temperature, to subdue the sweetness, it's actually enjoyable. Then again, I do have a soft spot for raspberry-infused (or influenced) beers."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3,"Nice ending to a hot summer day, light and refreshing. Aroma of fruit punch, pours hazy golden with a tinge of red, nice full creamy head. Taste is more fruit punch, with a lingering, sticky sweet finish."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.42,"This beer came in the most adorable little can. It poured a cloudy pink-tinged copper with a small head that didn't last long. The smell is raspberry, but not super artificial raspberry. That's about it, nothing that would indicate it's a beer. The taste is very sweet. It's like a raspberry soda. Only thing slightly beery about it is perhaps a tiny hint of hops on the back end. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. I'm kind of digging it, but it's not really what I expect out of a beer. If the idea of a raspberry-flavored malt beverage turns your crank, you might want look into it."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.05,"Presentation: 250 mL slim can, served in an oversized wine glass. No freshness date anywhere.

Appearance: Very thin, bubbly head that disappears almost instantly. It has a very nice, cloudy, light pink color.

Smell: The scent is dominated by raspberries, more artificial than anything. Nothing else.

Taste: Tastes mainly of raspberries. It's very sweet, and there's a little bit of malt.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and light. Feels sticky on the palate due to the sweetness. Good carbonation.

Overall: A very simple and fun beverage. Calling it a ""beer"" is reaching a bit. Nevertheless, it's very refreshing and nice to drink. Definitely worth keeping a couple of cans around for when you want to drink something different but don't necessarily want a ""real"" beer."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,1.39,"Bottle served into a La Chouffe tulip. Reviewed from notes taken July 2012. 4.3% ABV confirmed.

A: Pours a two finger head of slight cream and fair thickness. Retention is average. Body colour is a solid light red.

Sm: Artificial raspberry, an overload of sugar, and syrup. An unfortunately quite strong aroma.

T: Tastes like artificial crap raspberry, cultist suicide style koolaid (just drink it!), and overloaded garbage sugar and nasty syrup. Cough! Not really a true beer at all. I'm embarrassed to be seen drinking this. simply crap. Poorly built and balanced, with no redeemable characteristics. The finish is a sort of dying sugar-high stale note. Cough syrup comes through.

Mf: Very smooth and wet. Helps the disgusting flavours slide down.

Dr: 1.50 euro is high considering the pathetic state of the taste. Not a worthy beer at all. This is a damned embarrassment. Avoid at all costs.

F

**I just want to point out that this was terrible but I did not drainpour it. I finished it because I'm not a panzy. Remember: there are sober kids in India; nut up and finish your damn beer."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,2.5,"Cellar temp can poured into a snifter. the beer pours a brightish pink like a blush wine with some light frothy head of about 1 cm foaming up. Fades to a large wispy island in the middle of a thin edge layer.
Sits with a bit more amber color in the glass.
Aroma is sweet raspberry and a little grain but mostly sweet fruit.
First sip reveals a light body with minimal tiny carbonation. Texture is thin to watery and the beer goes down with almost no effort.
Flavor is sweet raspberry, like a sugary candy, jolly rancher maybe? Not much else on the flavor profile, does linger a bit on my palate. Finish is a little dry.
Overall the beer is very easy to drink and might not be terrible on a hot day if you can get by the sweetness. Im not a huge fan, but dont consider it a drainpour or anything like that."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,3.07,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly cloudy, rosy apricot amber with a thin white head that slowly dissipates to a ring around the glass, no lacing. Aroma of raspberries and not much else, but the fruit aroma is quite nice. Flavor is tart and sweet raspberry, very faint neutral malt. The berry flavor is nice, but this is far too sweet; basically an over sweetened fruit juice with a thin malt body. Light bodied. I had to try it, but our relationship ends here. Cloying sweet, but I have to give it credit for being pretty much as it presents itself."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,2.61,"Bottle 300 ml, ABV on the label is 4.3%. World Beer Awards sign on the label as Europe's Best Fruit Wheat Beer.

It pours a hazy pink colour, wit a one finger white-pinkish head with a good retention. Lots of bubbles in.
Strong aroma of raspberries.Quite artificial though, it smells like those vitamin tablets that get dissolved in water.
Very sweet in taste, and that sweetness stays in your mouth for quite long.
Very thin in body and quite carbonated.
Overall, too bad that I could only buy this one in a package of six, and now I have to drink five more."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,2.43,"Pours a very hazy apricot hue which leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and little lacing with a rim aswell,the smell is very sweet too sweet actually with aromas of raspberries and mainly that with also some fresh soft lollies and wildberries,the mouthfeel is lightbodied and tart with tastes of mainly raspberries that really dominate and dont let much else in apart from candied wheat and lots of sugar it really does remind me of a girls drink and i dont think i really need to say to more if i want to be polite cheers."
Worst,Wittekerke Rosé,2.13,"Wittekerke Rose

Pours a light cloudy pink color, light pink foam. Aromas of berries and a small portion of wheat malt. In the taste, berry sweetness, sugar, cola like carbonation and a little yeast. Alcoholic wheat berry soda. Mouthfeel is light bodied with spritzy carbonation. Overall, a fruit beer that is geared towards female consumption."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.7,"This is without a doubt, the most inconsistent beer on the market. Majority of the time I have had one, it' been skunky and not enjoyable at all. Yeah, the look s good and the feel is pleasant, but the skunky, bitter taste leaves you not wanting another. Freshness and storage is key to getting a Heineken that tastes okay."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,3.6,"Drank from 12 oz green bottle; no birth date. Taste of flat carbonation with slight but don’t biuscut taste. For what it is, there is far better out there"
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.72,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, ""best by"" date ""May - 2023"".

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, light golden color with 1 finger white head with decent retention, the head slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there was minimal lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.

SMELL: sweet corn and Euro skunk.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet corn and then a skunky Euro hop profile.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: I used to drink this at the country club and thought it was classy, until the craft beer movement changed my life forever, now I just think it's another AAL except the bottle is green and it was brewed in Holland, it's overly sweet and skunky, I would not seek this out again."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.47,"I put together a mix-six at the local supermarket. I included a bottle of Heineken. I hadn't had a Heineken in years--maybe 40; I remember it as a crisp, fresh, beer, much better than the American AALs of the era. I saw the ""malt lager"" appellation on the label, and thought that this must be a new product, an all-malt Heineken. Turns out it's the same, classic Heineken: It's an adjunct based lager, a bit hoppy but with a sweet overlay in the flavor that I suppose is a result of the corn in the recipe. I was a bit surprised by the extent to which I disliked it--I could barely finish the bottle. The sweetness clung to it all the way down. I love all things Dutch--visiting the country, cycling in it, exploring and savoring Amsterdam--with the exception, I guess, of this beer."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.63,"Poured from a 24oz can best by March 2023 into a pils glass.

On thr pour a fine 3 finger head forms woth a light straw body that has strong carbonation. Head retention is good, but it becomes fizzy looking. Vague lacing.

Aroma is largely light skunked hops, mistreated lager yeast, and some light but bright esters. Maybe some vague corniness but not a lot of malt other than that.

Taste is quite similar to the smell woth the same off notes right up front. As some of the cheap euro characteristics fade a slight floral happiness does stick through in the largely bitter hop extract. Once again a light and oxidized corny maltiness barely shows up on the finish.

Feel is fizzy with a lot of carbonation bite. It's easy to drink but not the smoothest from all the off flavors. Not as watery as expected but bretty light. Longer finish but not great.

Overall this is a meh beer that's overpriced I only picked it up because it's the last thing that isn't a high gravity malt liquor left that I haven't reviewed out of the 24oz singles at my local shitty liquor store. I wish it was maltier, but I guess the hops are actually detectable albeit gross."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,3.57,"Light Golden color, clear and has a white head. Smells very malt forward with a hint of citrus. Taste alright, kinda boring. Malty, some nuttiness and a hint of citrusy crispness. Overall its a alright, easy drinker. Its refreshing but its nothing special."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,1.68,"Imported Heineken is horrible.
I had it on tap on the Rock of Gibraltar and it was amazing.
It could have been the fact that it was very hot & I was very thirsty, but that was the best Heiny I ever had!
The bottled stuff to me tastes like stale hops and moldy malt.
I despise it."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,3.12,"Best By Date: September 2022

A - Light gold pour with vibrant carbonation.

S - Caramel, rice, and corn aroma.

T - Starts with some light earthy caramel malt followed with very light citrus, and then has a slight bit of toasted caramel on the finish.

M - Light medium body

O - This beer is what it is. It's been a staple in the beer world for a long time but not my gig. The fact I'm actually writing a review is really a feat in itself. This beer was brewed for quaffing, not sipping. All good."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.6,Drinkable beer if it’s fresh and ice cold. Once it begins to warm up the taste turns sour and skunky. This is a beer I’ll drink if it’s given to me but will never buy. At $3.40 per can in Ontario there are a lot of better options at the same price or cheaper.
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,3.22,"Sparkling pale gold with a tall white head settling to a very thickly persistent white blanket clinging well in doily lacing.

Just now realizing I have only ever had Heine Light, this is way less skunky than its younger sister, and it's actually got some faint banana characteristics. Color me dumbfounded!

Aside from that, there are notes of fresh baked buns with a slight tang of lemon rind, and its got a fluffy medium body that finishes semi-dry.

Wow, I really thought this would be a sub-3 score."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,2.83,"My first Heineken—I made sure to get it in a can to avoid risk of skunk. Smell was fine—a little fruity. Taste is just meh. Not the worst macro, but not as flavorful as the crafts I prefer. Average at best."
Worst,Heineken Lager Beer,1.36,How this has survived for so long is well beyond my ability to comprehend. Throughout all the many years I've occasionally revisited this vile stuff it's always had a rather revolting aroma which carries through into the taste. An off-taste which appears popular.
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.27,"DATE: July 25, 2022... OCCASION: our first night in Aruba is a success--time to celebrate with a beer I haven't had in more than two decades... GLASSWARE: nondescript 10 oz. pokal... a picture of consistency: its light golden amber body builds a bank of soft, craggy head that leaves behind articulate lacing--attractive, save for the lack of effervescence... sharp, sweet malts, burnt toffee, a bit of weirdly expressed bitterness, candied sugars, and perfumed hops make this a beer that sends a ""drink me quickly"" message... beefier than expected, it holds its place long enough after the initial sip to leave a softer, grainy finish... a bit more than a rinser, the malts are slightly burnt, sweet and almost chewable--striking for a beer that otherwise requires a tropical setting to be enjoyed... I don't mind that I waited this long to review a beer I innocently, randomly ordered in Russell's--it most likely tastes better in the setting we're in now!"
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.58,Pretty bad. Essentially less nose than Michael Jackson. Low on flavor. Tastes like cheap 28oz. clearglass lager in the hood in August. Feel is fine for 8oz but it gets flat quick. Wouldn’t really purchase this with my own money by choice if there were other options.
Worst,Polar Pilsen,4,"Found this in a grocery store in the caribbean a while back and it was cheap, crisp and refreshing - perfect for a warm summer day. Surprisingly good for the price if you're looking for a lighter beer that's hoppier than an american light beer."
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.78,"The pour is from an 8 oz. can, that's rather small & interesting. Oh look there is a cute polar bear on the front of the can & the beer pour a medium flow of carbonation with a white foamy head that dies down rather quickly. I do notice a best by date on the bottom of the can which indicates that they're giving this beer a long shelf life. The aroma is of grains with faint corn in the background. The taste matches the nose, but it's subpar compared to many other pilsner beers that I've had in the past. I don't know if this beer is brewed in Aruba, Venezuela, or Florida but wherever it's from it needs a tweak here & there. . It's not a disgusting pilsner nor is it a tasty one either. Cheers! C"
Worst,Polar Pilsen,1.75,"Cerveza con cabeza visible. Tiene un cuerpo ligero y es de carbonatación alta. En su aroma se percibe granos, mantequilla y jarabe de maíz. Una vez en boca destaca el jarabe y una sensación herbácea."
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.4,"Clear straw color with white head. Aroma has just a light malt note, that’s it. Taste follows with the light malt character and a really watery body and almost no flavor."
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.47,"Bottle at El Cocotero, New York, NY

A: The beer is clear pale yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down but never completely faded away.
S: Light aromas of corn adjuncts are present in the nose.
T: The taste has flavors of corn adjuncts and a little associated sweetness, bits of grainy malts, and slight hints of bitterness.
M: It feels a bit more than light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties when it is served ice cold. It was definitely fuller in body compared to what I was expecting.

Serving type: bottle"
Worst,Polar Pilsen,2.31,"The bud light of the Caribbean. This was not very good at all. VERY light and little flavor. Drinks like water on a hot day. It is a go to on Curacao. Hey... It was free so I drank it. Oh, and apparently it's brewed in Florida now. Who knew?"
Worst,Polar Pilsen,3.4,"It doesn't have much taste, but it is thirst quenching and dry. It has a hint of diacetyl which gives it a smooth drinkability. Not bad at all for the style."
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,3,"The pour is golden yellow with a steady flow of carbonation. The taste was refreshing with a mild herbal note. Oh well, it was interesting to try a beer from Peru. Cheers! B-"
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,2.25,"You can say what you want about this beer, it is not the greatest of beers by a long shot. However, it is certainly a great beach beer, and I am drinking the hell out of it while I sit on a Cuban beach."
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,3.34,"Drank my moneys worth of this stuff while in Cuba for 8 days...

Serving Type: Can, Bottle, and Draught

L- Pours a bright hay yellow topped by a 1/2 finger fluffy white head. Half decent retention (great for an AAL).

S- Faint aroma of pale grain, corny sweetness, and a slight grassy hopiness. Nothing bad here, just nothing particularly noteworthy.

T- Same as the smell. Very mild flavours of grain and a grassy hoppiness.

F- Light body and fairly high carbonation. Refreshing would be a solid descriptor.

O- Compared to most AAL's, this brew is fantastic. It doesn't have anything offputting and doesn't really have much to offer. Refreshing and cheap. If I make it to Cuba again, you can bet I'll be putting back some Cristal on the beach."
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,2.89,"Had countless cans of this as well as on tap samples while away in Cuba for a week. Served cold into a pilsner glass.

Appearance -Pale golden color, clear with plenty of carbonation. A small cap of white head is poured and sometimes lingers.

Smell - Not a lot here, some faint graininess in general and no off aromas, so that's a plus.

Taste - Again not a lot of flavor, light grassy flavors and a hint of grain with nothing off-putting.

Mouthfeel - Smooth and watery, light bodied with just enough crisp carbonation to make things interesting.

Overall - While not a great beer, it really does hit the spot and when laying on a beach or poolside for hours under the hot Cuban sun. A beer that very much can get some positive ratings due to the memories it invokes. For what it is, it is quite good. Dos cervezas por favor!"
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,2.16,"355ml Can in Santa Clara, Cuba (30 pesos):
Quite a basic & fairly poor lager but not unlike what I was expecting going in really & at least it wasn't offensive or off-putting. There was a few skunky touches early on but for the most part the beer featured the usual corn, hay & basic adjunct flavours but not much else. It was easy to drink throughout though, probably due to the heat in Cuba & as such I can't imagine it's one I'd have again if I were in the UK & it was more readily available here."
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,2.69,If you visit Cuba you will end up drinking this at some time as it is everywhere. Light and refreshing but devoid of any real character it tastes better than Corona and not as good as Pabst Blue if that helps. After waiting 4 hours for a bus to Varadero from Havana it tasted like Heady Topper lol but in the light of a normal day it is pretty average
Worst,Cerveza Cristal,2.94,"Appearance - pours a pale straw color with a finger and a half of head. Crystal clear.

Aroma - Normal adjunct lager smell with a slightly stronger bitterness than american and european variants.

Taste - Fresh crisp lager yeast flavor with some light malt first followed by a nice balancing bitterness. its an ok adjuct lager from a can, from a bottle it was skunky (green bottle :/)

Feel - light crisp and clean, again nothing more or less special than other adjuncts.

Overall - This is the most popular beer in Cuba, and just like anywhere its a crisp easy drinking party beer without much flavor. It fits the style and as much as adjuncts arnt my thing, I kicked back more than a few of these during my time in Cuba.

PERONI RED A/O ROSSO. THE MOST POPULAR BEER IN ITALY.

UNITED STATES. REPLACED BY NASTRO, A DIFFERENT ANIMAL.
I DREAM ABOUT PERONI RED. WE EAT PIZZA, SPAGET, ITAL CHOW, ALL THE TIME.
RED WAS AT EVERY ITALIAN RESTAURANT THAT SOLD BEER. IT WAS THE GO TO.
I CAN SEE THAT TAP OR THAT NICE LOOKING BROWN BOTTLE WITH THE RED & WHITE LABEL.

SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE IT FOR SALE IN THE USA. HELP"
Worst,Birra Peroni,3.31,"perfectly fine mass lager from Italy. made in Bari, roma, Padova.
I prefer this to other (Moretti, Forst) Italian Lagers.
Bravo, much better than a Heinekin too!
When in Italy, order peroni."
Worst,Birra Peroni,2.75,"(Bottle and draught). Very light golden colour, moderate head. ""Neutral"" pilsener flavour (yes, another one!) Drinkable, but Nastro Azzurro is better."
Worst,Birra Peroni,2.76,"Today is T, 12 Mai 2020 & I am in deep isolation during the COVID-19 crisis, giving me ample time to clear out my backlog. This one will CANtinue a few days of imports for The CANQuest (tm). This one came to me from local, in-person trader @tone77 following a trip to Italy!

From the CAN: ""La Birra Italiana (The Italian Beer)""; ""Dal 1846 (Since 1846)""; ""Tradizione E Qualità (Tradition & Quality)""; ""[undersigned] Giovanni Peroni""; ""Malto 100% Italiano (100% Italian Malt)"".

I have not had this one for a while & the last time was from a Bottle (Gasp!). This time around, I
Crack!ed open the vent & beCAN a slow, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass. I was pleasantly surprised by it rapid formation of just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with equally surprising low retention. POOF! & it was gone. 8=( Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose held the big reveal of … CORN. Cleverly identified in the ingredients as ""Granturco"", I smelled it immediately! I am submitting a ChANge Request to have it made an AAL, otherwise, it deserves mostly 1s as a Euro Pale Lager. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, about on-par for an AAL. Taste had the ruinous sweet, fermented corn characteristic that I had hoped to put well into my rear-view mirror. 8=( Okay for that style, but not my bag at all. Finish was semi-dry (?), but an argument could be made for semi-sweet (?). I would argue that it isn't worth arguing over since it's CANned rubbish!"
Worst,Birra Peroni,3.79,"I found on a photo from a long time ago that I had this beer on the beach on the Isle of Lido, Venice, Italy a couple of years ago so it’s not what you would call a real review. However, my memories from that time are quite vivid and what I remember is the impression of that moment - so my numbers reflect that. Otherwise I’m quite sure that it was a normal “Euro lager” but wasn’t THAT bad as Nastro Azurro (another brew from Peroni) was quite alright. Italian beers are a bit worse than your average lager from Europe, sorry but time does make things seem better in retrospect..."
Worst,Birra Peroni,3.26,"I am enjoying this beer in Italy (Naples). Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is weak, a touch of grains. Taste is mild, grains, some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, not bad, but kind of bland and boring."
Worst,Birra Peroni,3.63,"Birra Peroni s.r.l. “Peroni”
33 cl brown glass bottle, “Best Before End 12/20” and sampled on 27 November 2019

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is not my first Peroni, nor will it be the last, although I don’t think there will be too many more. It’s poured a clear golden body beneath a short head of white that’s dropped before my eyes. This is probably not a “beer clean” glass but none of the Peroni beers that I’ve sampled have had very good head retention and lacing. The aroma expresses sweet grainy malt with a little bit of an herbal hop component to it. It’s clean, and welcoming. The flavor follows, and its sweetness is balanced by a stiff bitterness that helps to dry it in the end but ultimately leaves some malt lingering. Interestingly enough, the bitterness and some herbal hops linger as well. It’s a decent Euro lager that serves its purpose. In the mouth it’s medium bodied and gently crisp with a fine, gently effervescent carbonation that’s quite nice. It might not be the best but if you’re wanting for a train or flight and there’s nothing else available it’s enjoyable.

Worst,Birra Peroni,3.11,Had it while visiting a local Italian restaurant. If nothing else it was a nice looking beer. It was poured from a bottle into a frosted mug. This resulted in a clear yellow body topped with a creamy white head that left good lacing. Smelled grassy. Tasted grassy and a bit sweet. Clean tasting. It went well with the food.
Worst,Birra Peroni,1.25,"Si tratta di una birra a bassa fermentazione in stile Lager, che si presenta di colore giallo paglierino tenue, con schiuma scarsa e poco persistente.
L'aroma presenta note di malto, cracker, forse un po' di limone, ma predomina l'alcool.
Il gusto è molto piatto, con alcool, malto, un po' di mais e molto amaro.
Si tratta di una birra poco carbonata, dal corpo leggero, con un retrogusto amaro e metallico.

It is an ale beer in Lager style, with a pale yellow colour, with insufficient foam, not persistent.
Its aroma shows malt and cracker traces, maybe a bit of lemon, but the alcohol stands out.
Taste is so flat, with alcohol, malt, a bit of corn and a lot of bitter.
It is a not many carbonated beer, with light body and a bitter and metallic aftertaste."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.31,"New review, because I was drunk last time.

Extra marks for the bottle cap. Perfect if you are heading for the field, school or a war zone. But it looks totally average inside a glass.

Mega unified hops and malt. Subtle sweet hops. I love it. Hops are beautiful, so is the malt."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.77,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden color with a moderate to strong white and spotted head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: The skunk comes out of the glass on this one. Initial aromas of skunk and light struck beer. Then some underlying pale and cracker malts. Some cereal malts with light flowery notes.

Flavor: Mild flavors of pale malts, cereal malts, white bread malts. Some suds and yeast. A smooth and wet cereal malt finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. a balanced finish. (4.00)

Overall: For drinking this one 6 months past the expiration date, it wasn't the worst I've had. Sure it was light-struck and skunky. Past that it had nice cereal malts. Decent yeast profile and a full mouthfeel and finish. Given the age, I'd give this a decent rating, but of course would like to find it more fresh. (Rating: 3.77)"
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.98,"A very light lager in the veins of many ""lowtier lagers"" like Heineken and Carlsberg. A bit lighter even. Not very strange maybe, since the brand is owned by Carlsberg. Quite water-like mouthfeel, balanced sweetness, not too sweet. None-screw easy open cap. Flask-design is clean and nice.

Not much more than that. Doesn't taste a lot. Very mediocre, but works good a really hot day or when you just want something easy to drink like all of these ""mowing the lawn""-beers. I could see myself grabbing one of these in the summer.

""Nothing special, but not terrible"", should be the tagline for this beer."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.75,"L: pours a clear golden straw with about 1 finger of head
S: cracker and biscuits, slight citrus
T: apples and oak, slight smokyness is the finish

O: a decent beer to have with dinner"
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.36,"From the bottle, it pours a clear yellow golden color with a small white head that slowly reduces and leaves some lacing. Grainy scent in the nose. In the mouth, it is grain and some herbal bitterness. Drink it cold on a hot day!"
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,5,"I come from Czech Repubic one of the biggest beer countries.
This beer is the BEST I ever had! I think people here rating bad are just jelous as they dont want another country to have such a beer.
After tasted more than 120 Czech beers and more than 200 foreign beers I must say that this beer is the BEST I ever had.
Frozencold with or after food.. G-O-A-T !!!"
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3,"Yes I had this while on holiday in Greece... and found it quite acceptable. Probably the best(??) Greek industrial pale lager. However, I don’t feel any need to have it imported to Norway.....

Rerate: It is now actually imported to Norway, in a watered-down 4.7% ABV version, in order to be sold in our grocery stores. 330 ml green bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Crystal clear pale golden colour, decent head. Fresh and grassy moderate aroma. The flavour is fairly ""clean"" with a moderate malty sweetness and fairly decent hops in the finish. OK on a hot summer’s day."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2.9,"Clear gold appearance with a small, off white head and a tiny amount of lacing. Mildly sweet, corny aroma offset by toasted grain. Metallic flavors overlap the low keyed hops. Vegetal aftertaste. Light bodied mouthfeel; thin, watery palate. Cardboard-like finish."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,3.23,"i love trying international lagers from strange locations or places that are not commonly known for their beer, this was a cool find, and its a fine brew, checks all the boxes for the style without really being unique or different in any way, but its not cheap to me at all, nothing metallic, sweet, adjuncty, or watered down, its seems all malt to me, slightly fuller feeling, and the finish would be very clean if it wasnt for the skunky green bottle character that unfortunately plagues it. i always try to not judge a beer like this too harshly for something like that, hard to police quality worlds away. this has a great mouthfeel with its round body and intense carbonation, and its boldly flavored enough to stand up to a meaty garlicky gyro, probably its ideal food context, seems born for that. a lesser lager would easily be overwhelmed here. id love to try it fresher sometime, but i do think it translates pretty well even still, kind of reminds me of green bottle moosehead growing up, i will always have a soft spot for beers like this. cool to have something international and different here in boise, i enjoyed this with my food at meraki downtown, a place i definitely recommend!"
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,4.21,"Found this one at a popular chain, Niko Nikos, in Houston. Six of them in an ice bucket for $15 was too good to pass up. No, I didn't finish off all six at the restaurant. Since the COVID plague, Texas has allowed us to buy drinks at restaurants and take them home. The beer? Oh, right.....it's a classic, fairly light, Euro-style lager reminding me of Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, or Stiegl. It's very refreshing with that hoppy bitter finish. We drink it colder than they do, I'm sure. It is just fine right out of an ice bucket, and I can see it standing up to a Southeast Texas summer. I would definitely buy it again."
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,5,Delicious light beer. Similar to Heineken. Smooth. Crisp. Refreshing. Great for yard work on a hot day. Or for sitting around the yard admiring whatever catches your attention.
Worst,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,2,In the category of European lager beers there are many low quality products. Drinks with the name of beer with the sole purpose of quenching thirst. Myths? Just a beer simulation
Worst,Bergenbier,2.7,"Premium Pils? It seems all Pils are premium in every single country in the world...

Very bubbly head...quite shiny yellow colour.

Refreshing light, airy, hoppy aroma, typical of a budget pilsner.

Not too sweet, and quite refreshing. Very well balanced. Totally fine for a hot day when you just want something refreshing and lightly hoppy when you are chilling in the sun. Light German style hops with a hint of Czech. Very light malt flavour coming through...

Mouth feel is quite watery and tingly.

Obviously this doesn't have the complexity of a West Coast IPA from the West Coast, however as a budget pilsner it's perfect. Extra overall marks as it's great value."

S: Thick, sweet, strangely 'heavy' in smell (thick as it passes through your nose) yet not a very strong smell.

T: Bitter, sour with an alcohol aftertaste.

O: The Romanians I was around didn't like it and said it causes hangovers, but I found it perfectly drinkable."
Worst,Bergenbier,1.96,"(Notes of 08/2007) At 4.8%abv., BB 25/04/2008, served chilled in a pint glass.

A: pale straw, lively fizz but fortunately not OTT, coming with a thin white foam.
S: metallic, very faint floral hop hints at the back, as well as lightly grainy notes plus some lemony sourness. Extraordinarily bland.
T: powdery hops and corn-ish malts, followed by a light yet rough bitterness, leaving very little of anything else to enjoy.
M&D: thin-bodied, fizzy, slightly watery... All in all, this lager is a waste of money to brew and to consume."
Worst,Bergenbier,2.43,"I (Wiseman Nick) tried this at a streetside bar in Sinaia, Romania a few days ago. Review written from notes.

Served in a .4L pilsener glass.

Appearance: Clear, pale yellow body with a big, soft, white head that actually retained pretty well. A blanket of lace trailed the head as it descended, but had little staying power on the glass walls. Pretty active carbonation could be seen within.

Smell: Faint. Lager yeast and sweet grains I suppose.

Taste: Sweet, lightly toasted grains, lager yeast, and mild grassy hops. Boring, but otherwise okay.

Mouthfeel: Prickly carb in a very light, malty body. Finished clean and pretty much tasteless.

Drinkability: Bland but inoffensive. I wouldn't order this again due to lack of character. A good beer for people who don't like beer."
Worst,Bergenbier,1.91,"This poured with a very nice white, frothy, foamy head and some lace. Almost no aroma. Head dissipates after a bit, but not completely. Flavor is a tad too sweet. Color is a light gold. Body is not too bad. Maybe a bit much for a sweet pale lager like this. Had another beer here that is way superior. This one's from a can. Ok in a pinch. Got this from a little kiosk up the street here in Bucharest with friend Anton this evening and rating it in our hotel room."
Worst,Bergenbier,2.8,"Picked up from Fidelio Supermarket in Ia&#351;i, Romania.

Golden 50cl can with a yellow and blue crest and a mountain. A couple of possibly stylistic medals adorn the front of the beer. Some wild mottos in Romanian as well. Wish I could read them, I'm sure they're amazing.

Pours a darkish yellow-gold colour. Lots of coarse-bubbled carbonation, feeding a large buy collapsible white head of rocky foam. Minimal lacing. No retention.

Slight meaty aroma on the nose, and a hint of salt. Mostly, though, it's the CO2; an overcarbonated smell of seltzer water. I would have said something pleasant about it, but I can't really find anything. Pretty bland.

Taste is actually ok, but still pretty bland. It has a surprising sweetness on the front palate, even (although it's sacrilege to say it) a little reminiscent of the Belgian yeast character, which the dips to a quite biting hint of hops. I'm surprised just how good this is on the palate, given the appearance and smell were marking this as a complete dud. Yeah, it grows on you. Mouthfeel is still definitely suffering from the high carbonation though.

It's ultimately quite a drinkable brew, but there's a huge polarity gap between the smell and the taste. If you don't let your first impressions fool you, this one might just take you by surprise."
Worst,Bergenbier,3.15,"Beer bottle (50cl), tasted in 2005 (a picture of moutain).

Taste and mouthfeel : malty, bittery grassy hops.
Drinkability : an average beer in Pale lager style

My review number 500."
Worst,Bergenbier,2.02,"The second beer in my Eastern European lager afternoon and as far as I can remember, my first ever Romianian beer of any sort.

Browm 50cl bottle with a BBD of 14th May 2008,it was drank on a sunny but cold Saturday in Feb 2008.

The beer was poured into my little Veltins Pilsner glass two and a half times.

Pale, clear and golden body, large white head, very little carbonisation, as in few bubbles rising to the head. The head by the way soon fell away to a thin covering and collar.

The normal 3 score for a non-smelling lager/pilsner.

Almost tasteless (like Bitburger), it is dry cardboard with K9P dripped on the make it wet. Very weak on the alcohol feel as well, the bottle claims 4.8%, it seemed more like a 3.0% to me.

This is one of the worst beers I've ever had and why anyone would go to the trouble of importing it into the UK is beyond me.

Avoid like the plague."
Worst,Bergenbier,2.33,"AndoBrew brought back a shlew of Romanian beers from his recent European excursion. I'm told Romanian beer can be a real special treat. Here's hoping!

Apperance: Pours a clear, light yellow body with a fizzy white head. Lightly effervescent.

Smell: Exceedingly light pale malts with a touch of spicy hops. The aroma is marred by the addition of cooked musty vegetables.

Taste: Thin, weak maltiness with a subtle sweetness and some spice-minded hops are thrown under the bus by that darned vegetal flavor which rides the tongue through to the finish.

Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Fairly unpleasant. This is indeed a bad start to the Night of Romanian Beers."
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.55,"This is a popular beer amongst young Australian males, finding their way in the complex world of beer and alcohol
Taking a perverse pleasure in drinking his stash getting cold in MY beer fridge I can make several observations

1 Beer bought by someone else tastes better than if you bought it yourself

2 anything in a clear bottle, Australian and labeled “dry” will be ordinary

3 thirst quenching (suited to a hot weather guzzle)
Anything more than a guzzle forces one to consider the taste
This is the beer equivalent of a coital quickie"
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.21,"Carlton Dry is one of a handful of popular 'low -carb' marketed Dry beers that has taken the Australian macro lager market by storm. Popular by people who think it's a healthier choice than a normal full strength beer. Coming in at 4.5% ABV, it's only .1% less ABV than Carlton & United's flagship beer, Carlton Draught, which this beer is modeled off. So let's see. Poured into my Arundel Brewery pint Glass from a 375ml can.

Look: Bog standard Australian macro adjunct lager appearance. Golden straw, filtered, clear, Lot of thin bubbles racing their way up to a frothy head that's maybe a finger thick.

Smell: Classic Australian lager smell. Pride of Ringwood hops, corn, slightly bready, metallic ring, vegetables.

Taste: Quite sweet and smooth. Very low, if not almost redundant bitterness. Dryish finish, but very sweet. Has a white breadiness to it, but overall it's very sweet. Very inoffensive.

Feel: It's clean, crisp and refreshing. What you're looking for in a lager. Medium body, a touch watery but that helps the reshing aspect.

Overall: Another standard, easy drinking Australian lager that's designed to be thrown back and drunk en-mass without really acknowledging the flavours behind the beer. In the hot sun, it's fine to quench your thirst after a bit of yard work. I pick up a 6 pack infrequently in summer if I'm after a few refreshing, easy drinking, no thinking beers after working outside, but only if it's on special. The marketing behind these beers is that it's supposedly 'low carb', which so many fall for. Certainly not drinking or buying it for any 'health' aspects. I"
Worst,Carlton Dry,1.94,"I am extremely happy and dissatisfied with this product. The taste deliciously terrible. CRISP. I left it out with the cap off in 108°F or 30°C and it tastes like shit. No bubbles whatsoever. CRISP. I tried to put it in the freezer and it exploded... are you guys secretly isis or something? Seriously crisp. The worst thing is that I tried to BOTTLE SOME DOG with it and the Glass DIDNT EVEN BREAK. CRISP. AND I GOT STABBED BECAUSE OF IT.

Over all 10/23 score"
Worst,Carlton Dry,4,"Hanging in Kellyville smoking a big ol' beef butt in the kettle.
This beer has a pale amber color like you expect from a backyard lager.
It was smokey by the kettle but it smelled ok, a bit of foam in the nose so I sneezed.
The call it an american lager but it's better than that. Seemed like a Blue Collar Beer.
Nice dry overall, not over carbureted.
Ah that was good. ...another? well hell yes."
Worst,Carlton Dry,5,Quite nice after a hard days work. It is my flagship beer currently. Very smooth clean crisp good in colour smell is good taste is very nice feel is good no lead ball in stomach affect. Overall I really do enjoy this beer
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.24,"Not much here but cold thirst quenching liquid. Faint malt aroma, taste is absent due to temperature coming out of tap. Finish also non-existant. Gods quaff if you’re thirsty"
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.96,"from can, A clear golden straw colour with a lacing white head. Aromas of grain, corn and biscuity malt that follow through onto the palate and that wet cardboard taste I get which I like. Light body, gentle bitterness."
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.11,"The schooner of brew, from the tap, arrived a very pale yellow with 1 cm of foam. The aroma was very light, but what waft into the nostrils was distinctly grain and adjunct. The palate was not appealing with lots of off-flavored, husky grain and overcooked vegetables, although there was a little bitterness at the end. Not a beer I would seek out."
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.04,"A: Served a light yellow color with a small head that fades quickly to no lacing.

S: Faint aroma of malt sweetness and nothing else.

T: No real flavor, just a bit of sweetness, no real bitterness, but yes it is very dry.

F: Light body, weak with no backbone.

O: Real waste of time and effort on this beer."
Worst,Carlton Dry,1.85,"Sulfur, vegetable on the nose. Softer carbonation than I was expecting but otherwise plan flavored.

Some sweetness and hop bitterness, but no flavour coming from the hops.

CUB seem to have about 7 beers all with different names but which are pretty much the same."
Worst,Carlton Dry,1.68,"Appearance - 2.0
Pours a finger of white head that quickly falls to leave a patchy skin over a clear pale gold body, leaving behind a ring of lace.

Smell - 1.5
A little offensive, sulphury and vegetal, with powdery husk.

Taste - 1.5
For me, this is not quite as offensive as Carlton Draught, though not much better. Stale tasting grain, corn and husk, coupled with an oddly sweet note (it's only 0.05% sugar), metallic hops, low to moderate bitterness and a bone dry finish.

Mouthfeel - 2.0
Gassy and fizzy with a watery, thin body.

Drinkability - 2.0
Ought to be at least refreshing, but water does a far better job, and it is actually quite bloating.

OVERALL - 1.7
It's not entirely in the name, but this is just another in a long (and becoming longer) list of dry, low-carb, low-taste lagers. Worse still, for me it is actually one of the worst of a very poor bunch. It seems the Carlton name remains ubiquitous with crappy beer."
Worst,Carlton Dry,1.42,"Pours a standard beer gold. The colour of beer. Carbonation is steady but not intense. Head is white, webbed all around and sinking in random spots. Leaves a ring of lacing foam, but little lacing from the body of the beer. Looks pretty standard.

Nose has not much going on at all. First impression is it smells like vomit. There is a sweet, light honey touch and a disturbing raw meat character to that. No hops whatsoever, smell is not simple but is really, genuinely bad. Not looking forward to drinking. Maybe if I hold my nose I can get this down.

Taste does have that really bizarre meaty character on the first sip. Mid-palate, on the plu side, has NO bizarre meaty character. Hooray! Rejoice! The mid-palate has no meaty character! Shame, though, and woe - accursed be the middle, for of flavour there be none. Nay meat nor malt nor grain, just ye olde water, and very thin and unpalatable it be. Finish be called ""dry"" by the lost souls who market yon grog, but I simply calls it ""bad"". Look, garbled early modern English/pirate crap aside, it tastes like pouring turpentine down the throat, I imagine. Chemical-metallic with a sharp, stinging sensation in the throat which cannot be put down to the 4.5% alc.

Other than that there's nothing to this at all. Taste is blah, and mouthfeel is bleeeeurgh. No hopping, no real malt. All they've done here is reduced a cheap beer to its bare minimum and all you can taste is the cheap. It could never be cheap enough though."
Worst,Carlton Dry,1.83,"Tiny generic lager head, with slight lacing. Crystal clear bronze pour.
Aroma is metallic, astringent, slight lemon. Pretty damn bad. Essence of piss.
Tastes is of carboard malt, soap and cooked cabbage. No bitterness whatsoever.
Very watery, with lively carbonation.
Overall, pretty horrible. Never buying this again."
Worst,Carlton Dry,2.57,"I cannot work out how this is different from the Premium Dry already listed but they do have different ABVs.

This pours a very pale golden colour. Reasonable head but not very dense. Quickly disappears.

Some hoppy aromas in there. Bit of biscuit as well.

The taste is of grains and that weird metallic aftertaste that CUB seems to specialise in.

Medium bodied.

A very average beer."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.5,"I dug this relatively well, it essentially tasted like Modelo which isn't shocking considering...ya know...made by Modelo. Overall one of the more enjoyable Mexican beers I've had. People rate macros way too critically. It will never have the same standard as craft beer so don't expect it to"
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.65,"Crystal clear, super light straw in color, a nice white head with minimal retention.

Minimal nose; just some light malt graininess with a hint of something sweet, verging on fresh corn but not really certain here.

Taste comes of as grainy, slightly Frosted Flakes like, like as if you removed all that sugar coating; minor hops on the finish and I even feel like I even pick up just the slightest hint of toasted malt as well.

Very nice mouthfeel to this beer for me; incredibly light and drinkable. It goes down like water and is very refreshing. As the nose suggests there is a slight sweetness but it dries out very nicely on the finish and doesn’t linger; also low bitterness on the finish.

I have to say I'm enjoying this beer quite a bit; it drinks very nicely and is very well balanced. A very good beer to refresh with on a hot day. This beer is definitely best drank cold; as it warms some of the smoothness of the the body dissipates as the sweetness shows a little more. Glad to have tried this one, incredibly drinkable and quick to disappear from the glass."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.48,"There's little going on here: little to see, little to smell. Taste isn't bad for a macro lager, however; it's very clean, with very little of the corny and syrupy sweetness that dooms most AALs. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp and smooth.

I can't say the lime improved the taste, contrary to popular opinion; I recommend you try it both ways and see what works for you.

Overall, this is a solid enough take on a Mexican pilsner."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.21,"Poured into a pint glass from a 24oz can

On the pour a 1 finger head forms then just as fast disappears to just a thin ring of bubbles around the glass, then eventually to nothing. A good amount of lazy carbonation in a body that is a bit darker than most light lagers but still very pale.

Aroma is a bit off but not bad like some cheap lagers. Dominated by yeast with some actual complexity which is nice and some decent light malts. Any hops are very oxidized. Not bad just not great and a bit old.

Flavor is actually nice for the style I can pick out malts and hop bitterness. The yeast is also a lot cleaner in the taste than the aroma although not perfect it's pretty dang good. Some light corniness but a lot of crackery malts as well. On the front there Is a bit of cheap sourness but it fades pretty fast.

Feel is crisp if not a bit watery, but still big enough to be passable. Refreshing and easy to drink but not the lightest beer in the world, which again I appreciate.

Overall this is really good for an adjunct lager, the hops are a bit old tasting, but actually detectable, and it maintains Refreshing crispness the style should carry without being skunked."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.25,"Drunk during my trip to Silao (Guanajuato, México). Usual bottle of the brand.

This beer pairs well with mexican food or any spice foods.

Look: Golden with a small white head and a small facing.

Smell: Some grains,corn, and hops.

Taste: Has a light flavor, clean flavor with some after taste. I t was very good good balance and mild mild bitterness on the back end.
Mouthful: Carbonation that doesn't fade and moderate dryness.

Overall: a good summer beer."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.25,The key to this beer is how fresh it is when you buy it..It's really good fresh..The data code for freshness is the the first letter with A meaning bottled in January. Unfortunately this beer is allowed to be on the shelf forever before being pulled and by that time is skunky..If your thinking of buying it check the code to see if it is within 90 days fresh or don't buy it.
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.28,"Had Pacifico Clara at Papito's Grill, Madison, Miss., on draft into tumbler.

Pours straw-gold with clarity and 1/2-finger near-white head, with some retention, leaving a little scattered lace. Not unpleasant aroma of sweet corn malt, and a little fruit as warms. Flavor is moderately sweet corn, and not much else, with a little carbonation and a touch of hop spice slightly crisping the finish.

No obvious defects in this beer, which drinks a little like a soft cream ale."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.09,"I had this on tap at a local Mexican restaurant. It was served in a frozen beer mug with a slice of lime on the rim, which I put in the beer.

Color is dull yellow. It has a small head that didn’t stick around. Light carbonation. Flavor was light, well balanced between malt and hops, with hints of bread and corn—and the lime went really well with it. This isn’t going to displace your favorite craft beer, but it was great ice cold with chips and salsa. I’ll enjoy it again with Mexican food in the future."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.75,"""Best by August 2022""; drank 4/9/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dull yellow appearance.

A rough pour yielded a nice white head; a thick curtain of lace.

Fresh corn, bread & cream.

Thin mouthfeel.

Cream corn, dry pine, hint of cream. Decent enough."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.09,"Poured from 24oz can into a dimpled mug. Best by September 2022.

Appearance: medium-gold, almost crystal-clear body with a finger of frothy eggshell foam and a very light apparent effervescence. Not bad, although the head subsides pretty quickly.

Smell: sweet and rather corny, with minimal hops. I do prefer this kind of beer in a can, as it has a minimal chance of getting skunked. But this beer is kind of blah.

Taste: a bit sweet and a bit corny, but neither as much as the aroma. There is actual bitterness here, too, which I like. While this might be a great beach beer, on its workaday merits it's merely an OK beer.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a decent carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: a perfectly cromulent sunshine beer, but not one that I would go to otherwise."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,4.44,"I went to visit a friend, smelled a beer on him and asked what he was drinking. It smelled like nice bready malt. He handed me a cool 12 oz can of Pacifico.
Appearance, missed.
Aroma, bready malt, some sweet corn, minimal, no apparent hop aroma.
Taste - bready malt forward, with slight hop undertone. No apparent off flavors. Extremely clean fermentation..
mouthfeel, nice medium body, moderate carbonation, very well done.refreshing with no fizzy outbreak.
Overall, shockingly well made extremely economical beer. Very well done.. i’m not sure what other people had been drinking, but the can that was handed to me it was very good indeed. I would love to try this on tap!"
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,2.96,"Probably appealing originally from it's exotic ritzy language and cool label, this is more macro not-greatness. First couple sips aren't bad, but gets old quickly."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,2.96,"Drank from a 12 ounce bottle. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The bright yellow of the label is certainly eye-catching, but it looks more like a billboard for a beer than a beer itself. Rarely do I advocate for just words and no pictures on the label, but honestly, the life preserver and other accessories pictured here act as a lot of visual clutter.

Smell - Wet dog. Nothing but. An assault on the nostrils. What is this? Absolutely vile.

Taste - Thankfully the taste is nothing like the smell. Actually fairly light and refreshing. Pretty good balance on the sweet/bitter dichotomy. Mild tone overall. As long as your sniffer doesn't catch wind of this, it's pretty good.

Feel - Could do with a hair more fizz, but it's just as thick as it should be. It lingers a few milliseconds too long, some extra effervescence would really brighten this up.

Overall - The beer tastes good. Pretty darn good to be honest. The visual appeal is mostly mediocre, but the odor is straight up offensive. Close to being a good beer, but it couldn't quite bring it home."
Worst,Cerveza Pacifico Clara,3.24,"Light thin straw color. Bready malt almost reminiscent of an Oktoberfest hits the nose. Rice as well.

Bready malt backbone with some surprisingly strong fruity notes coming through. The finish brings it down by being a bit metallic and unfortunately brings to mind college cheap keg beer. The opening notes are pleasant though.

Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

This beer is what it is. It’s a somewhat, sort of inexpensive beer with a better taste than a lot of American adjuncts. It’s 15.48 at my local Wal Mart, and spending an extra two dollars can get you a 12 pack of much higher quality. If this beer were 12 dollars for a 12 pack you’d have a winner. I keep it in my fridge for guests who aren’t into what they deem to be fancy beers, and for myself for a light treat"

Light sweet malty aroma.

On tasting, light, clean, some malt notes, but very little taste to it.

O: Reminds me of a Euro Lager, a bit bland but goes well served cold on a hot day."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.07,"Pours very pale yellow and very clear with a thin head that disappears quickly.

The initial smells can only be described as grainy. There is a slight orange citrus coming through – could do with some more power on the citrus side.

The sensation of the first mouthful is surprisingly bitter, strong and heavy for a lager which is fine by me. The problem is that the initial bitterness is replaced by the metallic taste that comes through with all too many lagers.

There is plenty of carbonation and you are left with a dry aftertaste."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.81,"On-tap at where else - Bluetongue Stadium!

Reviewed in the context of Beer at the Football.

Firstly it isn't VB, so that's a good start.

It actually looks OK, head is a bit frothy, but OK. Filmy lace all over which is a plus as well. Served at Stadium temp means no nose.

Taste is refreshing, which is what you want as well. Macro, yes, bland, yes, but not offensive. Mouthfeel is a plus, well carbonated for style.

Won't be buying a case, tho...."

This beer poured Golden into a glass....style of glass I don't know and don't give a SHEET!

Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.96,"note to begin with, this bottle was terribly skunked.
Appearance is lager like clear yellow with little head remaining.
Smell is skunk, skunk, skunk, i suggest this'd be better straight from the bottle.
Taste is actually good for a lager, not complex but smooth.
Mouthfeel is satifactory, that is all.
Drinkability is, its cheap, not bad flavour, pretty average"
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.03,"This brew pours a see through urine colour with decent carbonation that leaves behind a fast vanishing one finger head and very little lacing,the aromas are horrible weak grains and flat wine which is almost very similar to a macro brew,it has a horrible overcarbonted mouthfeel which has body whatsoever and exudes tastes of weak grains again and some pale malts with a touch of light fruitiness right at the end,overall make no mistake this is as close to a macro brew that you will find and does not interest me at all i will avoid this brew at all costs i say you do the same."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,1.31,"This will be the lowest ranked beer I will ever review. If I ever find another beer that is more repulsive than this one, I may cut off my tongue with an electric meat carver.

There is nothing special about the appearance. Lots of action going on. Very light copper-ish color. Small lacing, small head.

Smells awful. Smells like a lizard fell into my car's air conditioner, died, stayed in there for 13 days and then I turned the AC on max.

I didn't finish this beer. It tastes like carbonated piss. In fact, this is the most carbonated beer I've ever had. Bud Light and Coors Light reign supreme over this beer. Blue Tongue literally tastes and feels more like club soda than actual beer. If anyone drank enough of this to become intoxicated, they should be shot on site.

Mouthfeel is just as bad. It tastes like licking a corroding battery. Its almost as if the brewery stole a bunch of pennies from the homeless, melted them and used them as ingredients in this beer.

The drinkability is rated low because you can't stomach this beer.

May God have mercy on the creators of this beer. There is certainly a special seat in hell for whoever came up with it."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.26,"Pours a very pale colour like distilled urine, strong carbonation with minimal white head, retains thanks mainly to that strong carbonation. Lacing is a fairly standard streaky white. Looks alright.

Nose has a fair hit of hops with a strong POW aroma. Unpleasant sticky sweet fragrance rather like honey, but I think it's a rice adjunct aroma. Pretty standard and a bit unpleasant.

A strong sticky rice flavour on the mid-palate, quite insipid. Mostly saccharine with a bit of a very light phenolic hop towards the back. Finish is very bland, with not much, really doesn't have much of an aftertaste. A bit sweet is all, fairly boring and thin.

Mouthfeel is not too bad, a bit sticky for a pale lager though. A little bit of tingle saves it.

Not a great beer, adjuncty and dull, needs more of everything really."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.62,"Pale gold pour with a rapidly fading dismal head. Lively carbonation.
Aroma is of grainy malt, lemon juice and some faint grassy and metallic hops. Typical boring aussie lager.
Very similar flavours. Grainy aussie malt combining with a weak metallic bitterness threatens to block out any other flavours.
Active carbonation suits the style well."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.51,"Ouch, this was kind of a disappointing lager.

Light golden color with little head, very noticeable skunky smell at first, and on first couple of sips.

Skunkiness eventually gives way to a slightly malty flavor, with not much else happening.

As a plus, it has an OK finish & aftertaste, but not what I was hoping for (a lager to go with my roast chicken)."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.51,"Wow lot of hate for this beer, but hey its suppose to be a non offending lager for all those living in Oz. Its like a gateway beer but lets be serious its a quality limited taste/offending lager. But yes it didn't live up to any expectations.

Appearance- A very pale golden lager, its full of carbonation
Nose- None wait- Like a lager, with limited sweet carmel malt,
Taste- Initially nothing, rather its all about mouthfeel and slight bitterness. After much hunting, there is sweet malt and flavors. I agree with others in that there is something sharp/herbal&grassy in there.
Mouthfeel is nice and effervescent with a slick medium/light body.
Unlimited Drinkable- because of its great mouthfeel"
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,3.45,"Pale yellow. No head (sigh). Smells macro lagerish. That weird bitter (""crisp"" and ""clean"") twinge, you know? But the taste is actually very pleasant. It is clean. Perhaps not quite so crisp, but it's a bit sweet, has a little body to it. Very pleasant drinking on warm (probably not hot) evenings on the bay...

But, hey, I'm also a sucker for the marketing aspects - I like the little lizard. The graphics on the glasses do it for me (it's the lizard again, of course)."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,1.64,"I paid premium dollar for this boutique priced, beer. Label say Tasmanian bittering hops and late imported Hallertauer hops. I think that means, cheap Pride of Ringwood for bittering, and that the Hallertauer missed the wort and spilled on the floor.

It poured with a nice big quick disappearing head.

Aroma is slightly grassy with a chemical smell that is so typical for Pride of Ringwood.

Taste is similar and a tad sweet,but quite drinkable if you drink it from the bottle close to freezing point. (stay away from glassware since you might inhale the skunk aroma)

It's quite lively with more head and effervescence then VB XXXX etc. But for $60 a carton it should be gnomes dancing on my palate. Last time I felt this stupid after purchasing a carton of beer must been when I bought a carton of Hahn Ice."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.62,"This pours a clear golden colour. Minimal head and not a lot of visible carbonation.

I get a little bit of fruitiness but only when I give it a good shake up in the glass. Not a lot else.

Just a big glass of bland. A bit of sweetness in there which I think would get a bit too much after a while.

Not even anything to recommend it with regards to mouthfeel.

A very average brew."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,3.03,"A: Straw, 1 finger head...crisp, clean, amazing amount of carbonation - full on, like a spa bath nearly ;-)
S: Typical grassy lager hops, touch of fruityness. & they seem keen on using caramel in their beers
T: initial sweetness across the palate, carbonation a little milder than it looks...little fruity, followed by only a minute hint of hops bitterness to finish. Little dry, & does finish clean. Once again some caramel (their light has a heap of caramel)
M: Light to medium, crisp, & alive with carbonation.
D: very typical of a mainstream aussie macro lager...only a tad sweeter & fruitier. Still had that renowned dank chemical metallic aftertaste, but nowhere near as pronounced as VB, Melb etc. Maybe its our water!!!
Could drink more of this & would choose this over some other mainstream macros like VB, CUB, but maybe a little too alive in carbonation for me."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.86,"Appearance - 3.0
Poured a finger and a half of white head that quickly reduced to a paper thin layer over a very pale straw body.

Smell - 2.0
Barely any aroma whatsoever, all I got was an odd chemical smell.

Taste - 3.0
The lack of off flavours and pride of ringwood metal puts this a cut above the macro lagers of Australia. Sadly, there is little other taste to recommend it by - sugary sweetness, faint husk and grain flavour, very little hop character or bitterness, and a dry finish with little aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - 3.0
Moderately carbonated, feels a little watery but goes down easily.

Drinkability - 3.5
Very easy to drink, sessionable too, but not for those who like their beer to have taste.

OVERALL - 2.85
The blokes at Bluetongue obviously believe in the philosophy that a blonde lager should be crisp, refreshing, and almost devoid of flavour. This said, I would rate this above Australian brewed Heineken and any Aussie macro lager you care to name with the exception of Boag's Draught. Not a bad beer, but hardly a craft beer."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,3.35,Poured a medium straw colour with a finger width head that dissipated rather quickly. Has a rather fruity odour which reminds me of plums and cherries. It has a rather sweet flavour and is really light and refreshing on the palate. Very easy to drink and would be something suitable for a BBQ at the beach. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer.
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.49,"A: Light colored hay with a nest of bubbles at the bottom of the glass, releasing some to float to the surface. Head is a nice, snow white pillow resting on top of the body.

S: Astringent hops, slightly sour grains, little bit of skunk and coins.

T: Ugh. Tastes like white grape juice with a stale grainy aftertaste. Finishes copper with mineral aspects. Not going to spend anymore time on this.

M: Medium body with a lot of carbo sting.

D: The beers appearance had something going for it but it went downhill fast. I wonder if this beer didn't make the trip from down under gracefully. Regardless, its not very good and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.43,"Man I hate this beer and what it represents.

Bluetongue is (part ?)-owned by a prominent Sydney media player, and has been a remarkable success story in how one can convince the beer-swilling populace that they don't have to remain loyal to VB or New.

I wish I had a buck for every BBQ coversation I've had where the bloke says ""Did you say you're into beer ? Have you tried that Bluetongue... jeez it's good"".

So it's got a very, very big market: the brand-loyal beer drinker who is open to trying something ""premium"" (other than Crown Lager).

But for those who actually do know their ales from their lagers, it is a disappointing beer. Starts with nice grain & malt & hop aromas, but it all slips away into an incipid flavour & mouthfeel.

Stick to Cascade Premium Lager, is my suggestion."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,3.78,"Bluetongue's pale, straw gold lager is crystal clear and teeming with standard sized bubbles that race to the surface. The bright white head drops shortly, but a thin surface covering is maintained by the rising bubbles; and it does leave some nice rings of craggy lace in its wake.

The nose is lightly skunked (this has a green bottle, whereas their pilsner is brown), but not enough to overshadow its sweetish malt and remaining grassy hops.

In the mouth it's effervescent and crisp with a medium body.

The flavor is fuller than might be expected, and offers some lightly sweet and surprisingly grainy maltiness (I was expecting more adjunct) and grassy and floral hop flavors. It's backed by a solid bitterness, and it finishes dry with a quick passing note of grainy malt that fades to reveal some some residual hop flavor and bitterness.

Overall, this compares quite nicely with many European lagers. It's refreshing, rounded, and has enough character and integrity to keep it interesting and rewarding for more than one go round. Quite nice!"
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.23,"Green 12 oz bottle. Reptile on the label has a blue tongue. Quick blurb on the back claims its naturally brewed in the finest traditions of Australia's Hunter Valley. Ok, fair enough, I'm just curious what the fine tradition Hunter Valley has? Anyway on to the brew at hand. Poured into a pils glass it forms a decent fizz head that falls to a thin cover and spotty lace. The body of this brew is amazingly pale and ultra highly filtered, hardly a shade of color to this.

Light, sweet malts hit the palate first. Heavy Grainy, wheat, hay aspect to this and not all that clean to me. It's always been hard for me to describe most Euro Pales, there is something about them that reminds me of a baby's diaper type funkyness too them. Must be something in the malts I would guess because as with the others this is a fresh offering. A bit of a cooked vegetables on the backside. Finishes fairly crisp.

Notes: A long way for this beer to come to be average to below average, and at 4.9% delivered from great distances I can see this being short lived. All told it was one and done."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.94,"Lightish champagne gold. Filmy head, which disappears very quickly. Minimal lacing and carbonation. Quite insipid looking.

Sweet hoppiness on the nose, very light. Hints of honey, but rather reminiscent of a plain lager. It's ok, but a little bland.

Nice sharp entry on the palate. Crisp bitterness and a hint of lager yeastiness. Drops away very quickly to a watery aftertaste. It's remarkably bland, but I do believe it's better than the generic Australian swill. It's an easy drinking, rather forgettable beer."
Worst,Bluetongue Premium Lager,2.57,"I am drinking a bottle of this chilled in a pint glass.
The beer pours a bright clear gold color with bleached white head that foams up 1 cm and fades quickly to a thin sruface layer. The aroma is grainy malt and dominant skunkiness. uh oh!
First sip reveals lite to medium body with fine mild carbonation.
Flavor is starting sweet caramel and sugar witha bit of spicy and grassy hops moving in and then finishes grainy and husky malt. The skunk does not come through on the flavor much as the nose had advertised. A decent enough drinking beer that goes down easy. i wish it didnt smell so bad!"
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.49,"Visited Amsterdam; made a grocery store run and picked up a dozen random bottles. This was one, and I didn't even check the ABV until halfway through (shortly after thinking, ""good lord, this is sweet"").

It *is* sweet. Cloyingly sweet. And sharp. And malty, but otherwise bland and only slightly beery. Interesting, I guess, but no one's version of a great beer."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.39,"Light orange with a quickly disappearing layer of foam, which makes it look like a root beer within a few seconds. The smell is not that bad: fresh, herby and yeasty. The taste however is: an unholy matrimony of sugar and booze with some malt. No attempt has been made to hide this guy's huge abv. Though it can be pretty refreshing despite its abv, please skip this one. Taste should always be priority number one."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.24,"Served in a flute at 6*C
Appearance - Standard lager colouration, heavy CO2 and rocky head that dies off instantly and leaves little lace.

Smell - Oddly chemical with grainy corn possibly.

Taste - Medical alcohol and a very off putting chemical element.

Mouthfeel - Watery and metallic.

Overall - The drink-ability of this one is almost nil. Drain pour unless you are a homeless park drinker!!! (I don't mean that to be as harsh as it sounds I do feel for people in that situation but still.... this is a beer I associate with homeless alcoholics not a good look or a good beer) My advice is avoid this one."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.49,"Not amazend me. Strange and difficult. Malty aroma and flavor, very sweet. Definitely feel the alcohol and it's not a plus. Slightly saturated. I would not return to this beer."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.23,"Dark yellow, almost pale orange colour; nice head, absolutely clear. Not much in the nose, maybe some orange, no hops, fairly sweet. It tastes of sweet corn and slightly artificial. Undercarbonated.
Honestly there is no reason to drink this beyond getting drunk fast. There is nothing really revolting about this, but neither is there anything good."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,1.94,"Picked up a 500ml can at Albert Heijn supermarket. A beer calling itself ""Kanon"" is not something I can resist.

I wish I had though.

Kanon pours like a lazy lager, slightly gloopy but bright and golden. Mildly carbonated, with a bit of white fluff pretending to be a head. Visually interchangeable with any other ""superlager"" (think Gordon's Finest Platinum and siblings).

The nose, while initially pleasantly fruity, quickly turns ugly: solvents and booze, with a bland undertow of dough-like malt. A bit chemical. Literally takes 2 seconds to lose all fragrance in the glass.

Flavour is booze, layered with booze, with hints of booze and a delicate touch of booze. Seriously: it's a mouth-numbingly boozy and altogether unpleasant monster of a beer. While there are plenty beers around with higher ABV, this is one of those beers which seems to be designed just to show off the booziness.

Overall, this beer does not seem to be designed for people who actually enjoy drinking beer. People who enjoy getting drunk possibly might like it, as it gets the job done quickly, if a little unpleasantly."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,3.45,"With incredible strength that lands this massive lager somewhere between a blonde dopplebock and an imperial pilsner, the beer piques my interest in ways that I hadn't thought possible during my travels in Curacao. Taking a break from island activities and settling in with this beer and a good old American basketball game on television makes for one memorable evening.

The beer opens with a hearty pilsner pour that showcases its immense malt additions with strong honey-straw colors, firm golden highlights, and brilliant clarity. Racy carbonation fuels a stark white head that retains well for half the session, but the foam eventually succumbs to the enormous alcohols.

Honey, herbs, flowery notes, and a grainy-sweet scent emit from the glass and fill the nose with a strong presence of freshly kilned barley, baking bread, cookie dough, and springtime bouquet. Because of the light character of malt and hops, the strong alcohols allow for a rosy spirits scent to emerge.

Malt forward flavors capture well the taste of honey, sweet grains, bread dough, and powdered sugar with much more concentrated taste than the standard strength versions of pilsner beer. Balanced with noble German hops, the floral aromas turn honey-like with perfume and bright taste. Lightly herbal, early notes of lemongrass and fresh grasses turn mildly spicy and bitter to finish. Apple-like sulfur and esters allow for fruitiness that shares pear and apricot notes to rise from time to time.

Medium-full in texture, the residual sweetness gives the beer a fuller and somewhat oily feel, similar to corn syrups. Peppery carbonation gives a zesty mouthfeel with mild carbonic bite in mid palate and finish. The beer closes with very warm alcohols, semi-dry maltiness, and stubborn sweetness to persist in aftertaste.

The strength of Kanon definitely earns its namesake with the power that's twice that of the standard pilsner. This lands the beer somewhere between Samichlaus Helles and a plethora of American microbrewed imperial pilsners."
Worst,Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,2.71,"We pour a glowing golden brew. It holds a one finger head of big tannish bubbles. This shows nice retention, leaving spots of lacing all around the glass. Carbonation appears highly active, and no sediment or haze is noted. The nose is sweet, with huge booze, and cloying synthetic strawberry sweetness. The malts are adjuncty and bitter, but lighten up with a pale toast around the edges. With warmth come light banana esters, but even these seem forced and fake. Our first impression is in regard to the surprising bitterness. As we sip, that same cloying sweetness from the nose comes in the form of dextrin sugars and concentrated berry syrups. Booze is apparent right off the bat, giving black pepper spice and lactic sourness. The middle peaks with fusel, fiery booze, decimating all flavoring besides the pale malt base. The malts enhance a bit towards the end, with more caramel sweetness and depth, and some of that toast from the nose begins to seep out. Otherwise, the booziness reigns king and continues through to the end. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of booze and stale adjuncty malts, under ripe bananas, and light caramel. The body is medium, and a bit on the syrupy side, while carbonation is higher. The bubbles prickle the tongue, and leave a big foam throughout the mouth. This initially coats, but eventually dries with astringency from all the massive booziness. There is okay slurp and smack with each sip. The abv is huge, and the beer drinks slowly for that reason.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. While it seemed way overdone, muddy, and forced, some of the notes enlivened the nostrils. The flavoring suffered from being overly boozy, and you really had a hard time getting past that to find much of anything at all. Had they been willing to subdue that a bit more, it could have potentially been a much more curious, complex drink."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,2.87,"Who says that drinking beer CAN't be fun? I live to seek out new CANned beers for The CANQuest (tm) & sometimes things like this surface.

From the CAN: ""Premium Red Hot Cinnamon Apple Cocktail"".

A 25-fl. oz. CAN!?! A-BInBev must love to see me suffer! The Crack! was more like a CANic boom & required a crane to CANmence the Glug. Once I got it started, it acted like pop, fizzing & producing a skim of shimmering head that quickly dissipated. Color was Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like cinnamon-spiced apple juice, which was not all that bad, CANpared to the previous Mixxtail Hurricane. Mouthfeel was thin & watery. The taste was apples & cinnamon, but jeez-o, man, it was as sweet as pop! Whew. This whole series has been far sweeter than what I like to drink, indicating that perhaps I am not its target audience. Finish was semi-sweet with the cinnamon adding just enough of a spicy bite to keep it from being outright sweet. However, it still left me sweating with a sugar rush. Phew."

Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,4,Apple cinnamon flavor very addictive and just want to keep drinking more and more of this drink. I think this as a good alternative to any apple cinnamon liquor for less drunkeness
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,2.29,"Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker - Anheuser-Busch. Not my type of drink by any means, but I'm trying to clean out my fridge, so here we go... Poured from the 16 oz can into a pint glass, this concoction's head is nonexistent, zero lacing, and an amberish body. I'll give them that.

This aroma of this beverage is that of an angry stripper.

This tastes like an apple Jolly Rancher hard candy on bath salts & it wants to devour me. Please send help!

The mouthfeel here is just weird, ok? Just...weird..."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,1,"This was a challenge for me to accomplish. Amber colored. Smell was cinnamon with some apples. Apples quickly took a backseat to cinnamon. This led to a disturbing mouthfeel. Very cloying and it put a fire in my belly, a raging bonfire to be exact. I like cinnamon flavored liqueurs, not in my beer however. This had me curled up in the fetal position and whimpering like a puppy after finishing this. Never to have again."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,4,"Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 8.0% This brew pours out a deep golden amber color with a Small White Head. The head to this brew goes down fast. The smell of Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker nis sweet with apple cinnamon. The smell is kinda puts me in the mind of a green apple candy, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is sweet apple with a nice cinnamon kick. The cinnamon spice in this brew is nice touch to this brew. You really can't pick up on the 8.0% ABV in this brew. There is a lot going on in this brew. I like the taste of this brew. Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. The mouthfeeel bold rich, spicy,and smooth. Overall I'm giving Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker a solid 4 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. I'm on the fence with this one, however I do like the taste of this brew. Anheuser-Busch did a nice job with this one."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,3.4,"I guess my love for cinnamon out weighs the lack of beer qualities this so-called beer posesses. But, truthfully, I did enjoy drinking a 25 ounces can of this stuff and in doing so was wishing I was sitting by a bonfire on a chilly night. And as for rating this against other styles, I'm not sure how to do that, since this is just more or less a weak cinnamon drink with beer ABV."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,1.42,"Ahhhh yes...Sitting around with good ole friends from my college years ( which only ended a year ago mind you ) drinking some of the usual swills they have always found appealing. Usual BMC crap and occasionally when they felt like being aristocratic wise guys, A Killians Irish penny flavored water...I mean Red.

Nice to see the ole boys, a few of them now married and near obese far cries from their past selves. And still drinking like they are from the slums.

Handed this is what I think was a 10oz can? Maybe?

Look - I won't even pretend I poured this into a glass. So your guess is as good as mine.

Smell - Mmmm...High dosage of cinnamon and rubbing alcohol.

Taste - Overload of cinnamon that could be confused for a terrible alcoholic heat. Rubbing alcohol with cheap rotten grains.

Feel - Highly carbonated with a light body that burns like crabs on the black sea. And I don't mean fishing,

Overall - Why anybody would purchase this on a 90 degree Michigan day is far beyond my level of comprehension. Why anybody would purchase this for any reason is also beyond my comprehension. I just don't understand the whole cinnamon alcohol kick people in my age range ( 21-34 ) are onto."
Worst,Bud Light Mixxtail Firewalker,1.78,These Mixxtails are a piss-poor followup to the thoroughly acceptable Ritas. Firewalker in particular tastes about as artificial as apple/cinnamon can taste. Really embarrassing release that will (unsurprisingly) sell.

A: Dark orange amber color with lots of carbonation, no head, no lacing, clear, looks like apple juice with carbonation.

A: It has a strong candy apple artificial aroma, very sweet, cinnamon, candy, for 8% ABV it is well hidden, just smells really artificial, no natural aromas coming through.

T: Candy apple, hot cinnamon, a big hit of cheap malt beer flavors, very sweet, finishes with a hot cinnamon aftertaste, taste really awful.

M: Medium mouthfeel, leaves a sticky feeling on the roof of mouth, really sweet.

O: Horrible, it taste really artificial, the apple and cinnamon tastes do not come off as natural at all, I can't understand why anyone would drink this except to get an easy buzz. The beer had no head retention whatsoever."
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.6,"No beer has ever been more sought after. Is it Heady Topper? No. Tree house? Pliny? No, no, and no. It did, however prove to be about the most elusive beer in our collection. We have been trying to get a hold of this for the better part of 5 years. For one reason or another, the moose remained loose. We tried ordering it in through Total Wine. No dice. We tried calling the Moosehead rep at a different liquor store. Same result. This was all before the pandemic, meaning no trips to Canada for MD. Finally this summer after two years of no boarder crossing, we brought Moose Light home. It went down like nothing as the boys gathered for a weekend in Maine. The beer was fine. Regular Moose is better, without a doubt. Much more flavor, but moose light, while elusive, was a pretty standard light beer experience."
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.66,"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, a touch of grains. Taste is weak, some hints of beer? Nothing offensive, just not much there at all. Feels light bodied in the mouth and overall is a below average example of this style."
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.6,"Light bodied, not very flavorful.
A half step above club soda.
Tastes like beer flavored carbonated water.
It's a hometown staple where I'm from so its very common and accessible so I try to be more objective when tasting this beer."
Worst,Moosehead Light,3.37,"Moosehead Breweries Ltd. ""Moosehead Light""
12 fl. oz. green glass bottle, production coded but without freshness dating

Notes via stream of consciousness: Not surprisingly, Moosehead Light tastes a lot like Moosehead, it's just not as rich, nor as hoppy. I'll assume that they're just adding water to lighten it, but it could be more complicated than that. I doubt there's any high-gravity brewing going on that produces more than just one beer though, it's too clean and balanced for that. It's very well made, and the balance that you find in the regular Moosehead remains intact; it's just a little lighter and more refreshing. Of course I still prefer the standard Moosehead, but if I have to have a light beer this is one of my ""go-to"" lights. So let me run through its good points and bad points as compared to the regular. #1, the appearance is not as good. The clear straw-gold body is nice but the head retention and lacing are lacking. #2, the nose is lacking. The beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops found in the original just isn't there. It's still OK for a light beer, but not nearly as full or bright. #3, just like the aroma, the flavor is watered down (most likely literally). There's some grainy malt which is nice, and some lightly floral and softly herbal hops, but it's not completely satisfying. Again, as a light beer it works, and the cleanliness and balance are impeccable. #4, the finish is good. It remains dry but with some malt and hop character remaining, which is rare for light beers as they usually just disappear from the palate. #5, the body suffers a little bit but not by too much, and the carbonation is gently crisp. It's not too watery. Conclusion: it's at the very least refreshing, I think everyone will give it that, but it's also fairly satisfying - it's like you're drinking a real beer and not some hop-less and almost malt-less carbonated-water. Two thumbs up as far as light beers go!"
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.07,"Clear yellowish liquid in a green bottle. Aroma of corn, rice, husk and a bit of skunky hops. The flavor has crisp adjunct flavor and a small mineral and skunky hop presence. Light bodied, carbonated well. Subpar beer."
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.1,Pours the color if ginger ale. Pretty much a watered-down version of the standard Moosehead lager. The skunkiness in the lager is lessened but so is the general flavor.
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.6,"A-Pours a golden color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has lemongrass hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a lemongrass flavor
M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
O-A decent beer"
Worst,Moosehead Light,1.75,"nothing more than Moosehead with water added to it, bland and very little taste, they are always giving a free promos with this fare, in effort to get consumers to bite."
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.5,"Serving Type: 341 mL bottle

Having Been born and raised (and currently living) in New Brunswick, I've grown quite accustomed to the taste of Moosehead Light as it would easily be the most popular Light Beer in this province.

A- The typical golden straw color of the average American Macro Lager. Nothing special here but nothing to really complain about either.

S- The scent of Moosehead Light is quite sweet. Malty cereal grains is really all I can draw from the scent. Once again, nothing particularly interesting about this perspective of the beer but then again, who cares about how a light beer smells??

T- Much like the scent, the taste is fairly sweet with notes of cereal grains (similar to Molson Canadian). Not entirely pleasing but it is quite refreshing on a hot day.

M- Medium to high carbonation. Thin and water-like; a trait that pairs well with its refreshing taste.

O- Don't let my close upbringing with this beer dissuade from the fact that this beer is a great one (speaking of Light Macro Lagers, of course). No, it doesn't hold a candle to the great craft beers in the market today but I really do appreciate Moosehead Light for what it is. If you're looking for a relatively cheap and refreshing light beer and you have the opportunity to pick it up, go ahead and do so. If you go in with the likes of bud light/ coors light in your mind, you might even be a little bit impressed ;D"
Worst,Moosehead Light,2.96,"Pale yellow pour, small white head with low retention.
Smell of sweet malts, some biscuit and grassy hops, all kinda faint.
Taste of adjuncty sweet malts, somewhat lighter, some lemon zest, touch of apple and mild generic bitterness.
Light bodied, a bit fizzy, clean.
Not many bad notes, but pretty bland. Serves it's purpose nicely, easy drinkable."
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,1.81,"DATE: July 30, 2022... OCCASION: preparing for the Terrazo Italiano dining experience with the first of three Balashi products to sample... pours a flat, sallow golden body almost devoid of bubbles, with a head that swiftly dissipates to a ring of off-white head--squarely in line with beers that require limes... dish detergent lemon, some astringency, something akin to the garden hose, and cracker malts that don't really stir the interest much... its palate refreshes, swift with a slick malt base, enough effervescence to register its ""real"" ingredients, and a soft, simple aftertaste that cleans rather than satisfies... the flavor is as expected--a beer whose name is, in terms of advertising, a glittering generality, is reduced to the temperature to which it is served... slammable in its 7.4-ounce bottles, it doesn't move the needle for me, though maybe if I were a twenty-something set loose in Aruba, this might be the morning/afternoon beer that keeps me hydrated until the night arrives... for now, it's pure novelty and a donation to Balashi--you can't beat fresh, home-brewed beer in that regard!"
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,4,"Had for lunch in 7.5 oz bottle and Karmina’s Kitchen in San Nicholas, Aruba. I liked it better than the Balashi, it had a sweeter and cleaner more refreshing taste. Pilsner is not my favorite, but this was ok."
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.79,"This glorious golden beer reminds me much of a Corona. That being said, you must drink this with a lime, otherwise it is just not great. However if you’re on the beach or CHILLing poolside, it is refreshing to sip on!"
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.39,My bestie brought a can of this to Nashville whilst there for my son's hockey tournament. It poured a clear yellow with white head that did not leave much lace. The scent had faint grain notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with grain and lemon kisses. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its a good beer.
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,3.45,"Poured into a pint glass via can

Color is a light yellow

Smell is a lager..slight malt crispness, light citrus

Tatse follows the nose

Medium carbinationlight mouthfeel

Aruba's version of Bud Light..like Balashi, its not a great beer but tastes better due to the location you are drinking it"
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.61,"It's a good beach beer that I would recommend not drinking anywhere but Aruba. This is a pretty unique barley/rice/corn flavor, very sweet. Not much in the aroma. Feel is a little off."
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.29,"LOOK: Golden color with a little fizzy head that dies away quickly. Good clarity but the lack of head or retention hurts the score here.

SMELL: Per the style, you have pale barley malt, heaps of corn, rice and perhaps sorghum or other light brewing grains. Slight buttery DMS.

TASTE: Nondescript malt and adjunct sweetness, like granulated table sugar, then a pinch of citrus, followed by bread and buttery DMS. Hefty sweetness, hop bitterness is there just far too restrained. Light adjunct lager that finishes with cooked veggies. Very basic.

FEEL: Light bodied and well carbonated. Aftertaste has a bit of the DMS and cooked veggie thing going on.

OVERALL: For cheap beer in Aruba this is certainly an option. Stacking up to beer in the states, this just doesn't make the cut whatsoever. Still a perfectly fine cheap simple beer if you find yourself on a beach somewhere remote and don't trust the local water supply. Another flavor of Rice, Corn, Malt mix beer for those with more serious inquiries."
Worst,Chill Caribbean Beer,2.3,"Another smuggle from Aruba, and another 7oz bottle. Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is an extremely pale, yellowish coloring, with slow carbonation bubbling in the body, and a wisp of white on the surface. This looks limp. Aromas of nothing. Literally, nothing. At most, if I really dig in there, I can catch a hint of roasted corn, but that is a stretch. Flavors are toasted corn forward, with an almost astringent aftertaste immediately after you swallow. Musty notes, and a couple of off esters in there, too. Yikes. Light, watery body, with a grainy and semisweet aftertaste. The finish is non-remarkable."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,4.64,"This is a great summer beer to drink In the pool or river on a hot summer day. Especially between meals, if you want to fancy line a pint glass with salt and lime slice.
Perfect beer!"
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.82,"24 ounce can, best by date of JUL 2022 stamped on the bottom of the can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy reddish/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. Pretty much no lacing at all. The brew smells like tomato juice and salt, and that's about it. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some lime, grainy malt and a slight weird bitter flavor. I didn't care for it much at first, but did get a little better as it warmed. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy enough to drink with a good amount of carbonation. This is OK I guess, but there's other Chelada style beers I'd rather have. But with that being said I'd drink this one again if someone gave me one."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,1.56,"24oz can served to me by so-called ""friends""

This is an abomination no matter how you slice it... but people seem to love it... I'm not sure how to rate this because I truly hate it, but it obviously has it's place: I've seen these chelada beers all over. Gives me gut rot, heartburn, and tastes like musty cheap beer and spoiled tomato juice

ugh"
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.02,"Tried this on a whim as I dont think I have ever had a chelada style beer. Drank from the 24oz can. The beer smells and tastes like V8, which is to be expected, with a slightly salty finish. Nothing much more to say. I tried to find other notes but it was tomato all the way. Altogether not terrible but Id rather have a bloody mary."

Taste of tomato, salt, lime. Reminds me of a chilled tomato soup appetizer.
Overall not bad. First time drinking a Chelada and it is better than I expected. Refreshing on a hot day. Good as a pre-meal drink."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.71,"my wife loves these things, im still trying to learn her ways, but this is marginally better than some of its peers i suppose. brewed with natural and artificial flavors and sweeteners, and whatever the hell certified color is, sounds pretty fake to me, and that kind of thing turns me off in beer, shouldnt it just be tomato juice and some salt and lime? i dont know, but it doesnt taste bad. murky reddish brown color to this, no head at all but a lot of fizz, and just a little sediment in the big can, which was somewhat more expensive than anticipated, not quite a budget beer. it smells salty and citrus forward, some acidity evident from the tomato and a natural enough lime essence, maybe a hint of black pepper too, but i dont get any real beer character in the aroma at all, more like a bloody mary without the booze, this is very low alcohol. the flavor is okay, salty and kind of cheap tasting at first, but the tomato comes in nicely and there is a v8 juicy vibe to it. it is a touch sweet and i wish that would go away, but also i think the proportion of beer is a little light in here, like i want more lager crispness coming through, and i think this loses some refreshment capacity because its more the tomato juice than the beer. that said, ive had worse, and even though this gets a little yucky as it warms, its one of the lesser of the evils i reckon in this style. nothing is ever going to beat making and blending your own, but you can do a lot worse than this one. ive heard from a trusted source that the limon is dynamite, i need to track that one down..."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.98,"Straight out of the can. Rose red color, heavy carbonation. Classic chelada, strong lime, salt, tomato, climate, and a tinge of beer flavor. Pretty weak at 3.5% ABV but that is to be expected for chelada I guess.

My only gripe is I really can't drink much of the stuff, it is incredibly salty. Goes great with some fish tacos though!"
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.5,"(24 oz can, code E019A019' purchased cold of course... poured into 28 oz mug)

L: ultra-cloudy, plum-rosee colored liquid; violent build and collapse of not-quite-foamy bubbles on the pour, much like a soft drink... quite a bit of sediment (tomato grit) left as 'lace'

S: much like a bloody mary, lots of tomato juice at the fore... not quite getting much lime, if any, and perhaps picking up a mellow saline undertone... not really any booze on the nose; overall it's relatively inviting

T: tomato juice and salt right away, with a brief flash of malt/beer in the finish, and a muddy mix of tomato juice and lager (much more of the former) in the aftertaste... bit of a fruity tone - juiced lime rinds and tomato flesh - builds on the finish after the first few sips, but the lager does somehow continue to poke through... overall, it's relatively dry, with no one flavor lingering to sickening effect; the lime is merely a background tinge at best

F: considering the fizzy folly on the pour, I take it this particular rendering of the drink is meant to be swilled from the can; very little carbonation felt... semi-flat; pretty much light-bodied, but with a delicately greasy finish

O: after years of ticking tipples, this is where I now find myself - accelerating the pace with ~$2 cans/bottles of fruity Bud Lights and Lime-a-Ritas, umpteen homogenous adjunct lagers, various malt liquors, and now finally this stuff... it'll all be over soon, one way or another (1530)"
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.78,"Taste: tasty tomato, lime salt, veggie beer. Big, bold tomato juice nose. Color and opaqueness of Tomato juice, not much head. Full body. Like having a Bloody Mary."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,1.84,"Imagine getting really drunk off cheap beer and then eating a ton of pizza, puking it up and drinking it. Seriously though this is my first time drinking a beer of this style so I can't compare it to anything else. It smells like tomato and has a watered down bloody Mary taste. The first taste is really off putting but it does get more drinkable."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.26,"As with Buld Light Clamato Chelada I will review this for what it is: a vegetable beer with salt, lime & tomato juice. You can't compare a Lager to a Porter just like you can't compare this to a Stout, Pilsner, Belgian, IPA or any other beer style. You have to compare it to other fruit beers. I'm not really a fan of fruit beers but I like tomato juice, V-8 and it goes without saying I like beer so here goes:

Pours a hazy, watery, stale blood brown red producing only a hint of rusty, short-lived, head that leaves a thin coat of grainy wash that I would not dignify by calling it lace. Aroma is tomato & lime with a faint hint of beer/adjunct grains drowning in the background. Taste is stale tomato juice flavored mineral water: tomato, vegetal, brine, lime & a thin beer/adjunct grain hint. Does not list having chilis in it but it has a smoky chili/thin Tabasco hint in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with high carbonation, slick with spice & a peppery, prickly bite. It is not nearly so drinkable as Bud Light Chelada. Puts you in mind of a stale, watery, virgin Bloody Mary."
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,3.5,Taste note to me are lime and light lime juice. Salty and some what sweet. It's a easy drink and taste good to me at least. For its price and flavor it's something I would suggest specially with cooking on a grill. Seems like a great hot weather beer as well.
Worst,Modelo Especial Chelada,2.63,"24oz can poured into Shock Top weizen glass. No discernable date, but there are some characters stamped on the bottom of the can. Normally bars serve cheladas in a chalice, tulip, oversized wine glass or large mug. But the only reason they tend to do that is for presentation purposes, so they can fit in a bunch of garnishes like celery or sometimes upside-down beer bottles. But if you're drinking it properly, pre-pepared without the garnishes, the proper glass to pour it in is very narrow like a weizenglass (my pick), a narrow stange, or even straight from the bottle or can itself. This is because it's a very effervescent style like a soda, and loses its carbonation easily, so you want to reduce that as much as possible so you don't drink it flat.

Appearance - Virtually non existent, whitish head that dissipates almost instantly leaving no trace. Opaque orange-red body with lots of visible, dense particulate matter. Pretty par for the course. 3

Smell - Almost like straight V8. 3

Taste - Not as good as the tamarindo picante version. While it also doesn't have the same clamato you'd find in other cheladas, there is a more noticeable sweetness than the picante version. I find the spice lacking and there's a faint but distracting off character in there, a perhaps metallic or stale corn aftertaste. 2.5

Mouthfeel - Noticably less refreshing than the tamarindo picante version. Feels a little more syrupy, and while it has some effervescence, it seems so volatile that it will dissipate before you can drink it. 2.75

Overall - I know fellow beer geeks hate the chelada style, they might see it as a bastardization of beer. But I wouldn't even call this a guilty pleasure. This is straight up an underappreciated style that I love unashamedly. However, this specific example is sub par, and doesn't even match the quality of the tamarindo picante version made by the same brewery. 2.25"

Very little to recommend here other than the fact it can be gulped down like water, taste not dissimilar to water in fact. Boasting the colour of weak tea and a rapidly diminishing foamy head, this drink entices the nose with very little at all. The tasting doesn’t disappoint, as the hope of any flavour is dashed by its soapy blandness. If you’ve been surfing all day this stuff is probably great, but I hadn’t, and it wasn’t."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.28,"Looks and feels like most standard, malty American lagers. Bland malt smell, head thins into a broken lace. Looks like apple juice or urine, tastes malty with a metallic-tinge and a slightly chemical, soapy aftertaste. In the part of Indonesia where I stayed, it was the most abundant and affordable alcoholic beverage, and was a decent thirst quencher. Avoid otherwise."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,1.64,"Decanted from a 11.2 oz (330 ml) can into a custom taster pint; best by 30 July 2019.
A: Pours a nearly clear, dark golden color with a less than one finger, briefly foamy white head, no serious retention, and little or no lacing.
S: Picked up a butyric acid aroma throughout. Hard to smell anything other than that.
T: Dry. Almost an apple flavor, very light malty and grainy with low bitterness.
M: Light bodied with very low carbonation. Drinks smoothly but slightly astringent.
O: Off aroma of butyric acid is pretty much a deal breaker. This was also not an old can, based on the best by dating, so no excuse. Basically, a very low end Pilsener. Might be my lowest rating ever."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.01,"It has been quite the exotic couple/few days for me! First, I had some Serbian & Armenian beer, thanks to @tone77 & now I am moving on to Indonesia, courtesy of one of my recent visits to The Beer & Beverage Shoppe on Roseville Road, off of the Fruitville Pike. It is getting to be like my travels & travails in the Navy!

From the CAN: ""International Quality""; ""Brewed with quality ingredients""; ""For export ONLY"".

Phew! Good thing that I purchased it outside of the country or who knows what sort of punishment might have befallen me! I happily Crack!ed open the vent & then beCAN an inverted Glug that resulted in two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. I then celebrated the lovely lacing that it left in its wake. Color was a beauteous Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, summoning forth The Gelt Gang of Croesus, Mammon & Midas for a taste. Nose was a real corn-laden downer, full of a silage-like scent that now causes me to cringe & CANtemplate heading for the hills. 8=( Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was actually rather mild, still very much in the maize, but not as pronounced as in many beers in the style. It was the kind of thing that you might not mind drinking on a hot, humid day, but it was not making it for me in the face of the cold Winter chill. If it were not for its use of corn as an adjunct, it might have been fairly pleasant, given its light flavor. Finish was semi-sweet, about on par for the style. Ho hum. CANother day at CANQuest (tm) HQ."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,2.5,"660ml Bottle from Morrison's supermarket (£1.67):
This one is pretty much what I’d been expecting when I picked it up, it was an easy going and somewhat refreshing pale lager that could easily be described and basic and bland but definitely not offensive. It was easy to drink without much in the way of flavour showing, some lager malts and the odd grassy flavours were about it really but I won’t complain too much since the beer serves a purpose. I can’t imagine it will be a beer I’d pick up again unless I manage to visit Indonesia, and if I do then I’ll probably end up drinking it 24/7 over there; it’s also not the worse Asian beer I’ve tried which has to count for something."

Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.6,"American Adjunct seems to be popular in South-East Asia for some reason - and although beer lovers tend to criticize them for being poor, they do have a certain quality.
Imagine being somewhere in Indo-China during or after the monsoon with 100% humidity and tropical heat - there's nothing that quenches your thirst and cools you down than an ice cold American Adjunct!
No particular flavors, just a hoppy, light malty refreshing, easy to drink, light beer.
This is just like that, no outstanding features (couldn't tell the difference between a Chang, a Tiger or a Kingfisher perhaps) but does what it supposed to do quite well - quench thirst."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,2.5,"From estucerveza. In Teku glass. Playing Broken Age. Completely standard pale lager, like many industrial ones from around here. Completely flavorless and boring."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.86,"Okay. You're in Bali. Your other choices were Heineken or Tiger, so you went with the local beer.

It pours an unattractive straw, and seems a bit of the watered down side. It certainly doesn't smell like any hops you can recognize. But its hot, like really hot, and there's no shade in sight. Just you, on in an island paradise that doesn't really appreciate beer. You 'neck it' back like the Aussies you're surrounded by would do.

It tastes like a pre-made shandy, and you're not sure if the sugary sweetness is deliberate, or if its under attenuated... But strangely its the perfect thing for where you are. You go back stateside, but no one carries some random Indonesian beer... Even if every bottle is like a time capsule to island paradise."
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,3.67,Golden and carbonated. Fairly well hopped and with the adjuncts not making their presence too obvious. Light bodied and refreshing it goes very well with spicy food in a very hot environment.

S - malty, lager yeast, similar to Bud, Miller, etc.

T - sweet, bland, very slight bitter grassy note from the hops, slightly woody aftertaste

F - thin yet oily? medium carbonation

O - seems to be the only form of alcohol available on Sunday because of government regulations, so it's got that going for it"
Worst,Bir Bintang Pilsner,2.71,"My understanding is that Bintang is basically identical to Heineken.

It's good for traveling in Bali but probably wouldn't be good enough outside of Indonesia.

Light flavor all around. Hint of pilsner sweetness and a very subtle hop bitterness. Might just be my imagination. Highly fizzy.

Good for the sweltering heat of Bali afternoons. Won't get you buzzed unless you have at least four of them. Maybe that's a byproduct of the sweatiness i experience here.

The only other beer I've tried here is Bali Hai, and that strikes me as a miller high life clone.

Glad there's at least beer to drink on my vacation in a predominantly Hindu society."

Worst,Kirin Tanrei Green Label,2.8,"Pours a pale yellow with a finger of white foam. Head retention is below average. Aroma is pilsner and bread malts. Comes across very light in the aromatic category. Flavor profile is pilsner, bread, and biscuit malts. It has a big skunky, lemony, yeast ester note come on thick at the height of the flavor profile and then subsides back to a malty finish. Lemon is left on the tongue for a while. Mouth feel is medium-thin with an effervescent, bubbly texture. It's crisp. It has a medium thickness. Overall, despite a pretty tame aroma, the flavor profile lays on a good bit of flavor, just not all in the best direction. It's the most refreshing option of the Kirin Tanrei's though.

Served in 12oz snifter from a 16oz equivalent can."
Worst,Kirin Tanrei Green Label,1.83,"350ml Can from Family Mart, Tokyo (¥138):
Terrible stuff from Kirin here & a beer that I will definitely not be returning to in future, it was quite a weak & poorly balanced beer with the taste a massive step down from an already poor aroma. There wasn't much of anything going on really, save for some basic corn & citrus flavours which made it one-dimensional & not very enjoyable; one of the worst I tried in Japan."
Worst,Kirin Tanrei Green Label,2.3,"A: Pours a crystal clear pale golden yellow in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint bright yellow highlights. The beer has a three finger tall foamy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of mottled thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Very light aroma overall with light aroma of grainy malts and rice adjuncts with just the slightest hint of grassy hops.

T: Upfront there is a light flavor of grainy malts with a light amount of rice husk adjuncts and just a touch of grainy sweetness. Very light hints of grassy hops and no perceptible bitterness.

M: Light bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Initially crisp and smooth through the finish with a thinness/wateriness.

O: Not offensive in any way but certainly not good/enjoyable and not a beer that I would seek out again. Grateful for my wife bringing this one back from Tokyo for me ."

clear and extra pale, ginger ale sounds and a pathetic head. there's a tiny, thin white circle around the glass that, i guess, used to be the head ten seconds ago. two or three bubbles float up every once in a while. oh yeah, there it is. it has that unmistable near-beer smell. unappatizing.

Worst,Kirin Tanrei Green Label,2.09,"Can states proudly, 70% less sugars
Ingredients: Malt, hop, barley, sugars and yeast extract.
Less than 25% malt by volume (which means they pay little tax on this product).

I really have to reach to describe what this tastes like. At first I thought it was made entirely of rice husks, but to my dismay and shock this is made with no rice additives. This must be the only beer in Japan that is not. Considering this is made with less than 25% malt, and probably not much barley, this beer must be the taste of fermented ""sugars"". Now, I believe this beer is 70% sugars, which includes carbohydrates, so it must be fermented from simple sugars. (?).

This beer was so boring, I wouldn't even finish the can if served by a super-model."
Worst,Kirin Tanrei Green Label,2.47,"This beer looks very good, but as a light Japanese beer, it is indeed light and lacking in what one expects of one's beer. However, it's a nice golden, sunflower color, and it is extraordinarily easy to drink. Not bad for a light ""happoshu"". The green label also makes me happy."
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.18,"16oz can at the US Open. Not nuanced at all. Grim, tasteless and watery industrial lager. Arguably worse than the only other beer available on site, Heineken. Ice cold, though. The only good thing about it."
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.87,"Poured from a 12oz can best by 2023

On the pour an insane 4 finger slightly fizzy head formed then slowly dissipated to a ring around the glass and some head islands floating around. Despite the style some vague lacing forms. The body is a light gold to darker straw. Carbonation is fine but active.

Smell is rough as expected a tart mistreated yeast with some light skunk. Behind that is a light crackery malt. Notch else here other than meh.

Taste is better but quite sweet with no bitterness. Some nice barley is on the palate and corn is a bit less strong, but it's normal macro. Quite drinkable and it tastes clean and a bit malty. Some cheap tartness is in there but it isn't bad.

Feel is a bit thin and dry woth a light co2 bite. There is an odd malty syrup feel at the back of the mouth despite the dryness. Still it is quite crisp and drinkable despite all that. Keep it cold.

Overall it is what it is. Not really a beer for the most interesting man in the world but still it's decent. It could be better but for what it is it could be a lot worse."
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,4.22,"i dont know why. but the first life changing beer that i tasted was my dad's dos equis ordered at a mexican restaurant. its probably not that good as i remember it, but for some reason the powers that be decided that this specific beer would change my view on beer forever."

Simple clear staw colored beer with some hints of citrus on the nostrils, but other that it has a light aroma. Tastes pretty plain. It's honestly a boring beer. Not disgusting, but outside of it being provided to me at a party or something I have no real desire to drink it. Adding lime is a good choice, and I suppose it would make a good summer beach beer, but you obviously could better. It's not as watery as say Bud Light, but still not what you could call a tasty beer."

Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.79,"BB date : July 2022

Clear gold, with 3/8"" white head.

Smell is .....still waiting......still waiting...... light sweet grain, maybe a hint of fresh corn. Maybe. The aroma is pleasant, but difficult to detect.

Taste is similar to aroma , that is, barely there , slightly sweet grain, plus a hint of citrus rind (lemon), finishing with a slight corn meal flavor, that lingers....no, that's too refined for this.....sits there..... for a couple of seconds. Light bitterness. It doesn't have much taste, but it has no unpleasant flavors, so I'll bump it up .5 for that.

Feel is light, smooth, with moderate, very fine carbonation, that gives a drying finish. Said finish is pleasant, until the last instant, where it goes a half-step too far, and borders upon licking cardboard. Doesn't go all the way there though, so is well ahead of most of its brethren in this corner of beerdom. Points! ;P

I don't always drink Dos Equis, but when I do I hardly notice. ;)
Really , I've had this maybe three times previously, but not in at least fifteen years, and had no memory of the experience(s), other than it happened. It is much better than I expected. Nothing much to recommend it, but nothing awful either. It's liquid, it's cold, and it's carbonated. If that's all you need at a given moment, and there are no GOOD options, this will do. *shrug*"
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,1.73,"I don't always go out of my way to write a bad review, but when I do I write it about this crap in a bottle. This beer is disgusting no wonder their citizens flee the country, they want better beer! Cerveza es muy buneo Norde! I would not wash my dirty feet with this garbage. This is as bad as corona."
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.53,"Look: Light golden straw coloured. Fingers worth of soapy frothy head. Lots of carbonation. About standard for a Mexican/North American lager. Fully filtered

Smell: Corn, bit of grain. No hops or bitterness to speak of, nothing that really stands out. Smells like an typical north American adjunct lager.

Taste: Sweetness from the malts, corn, grain, not a lot else going on. No bitterness at all, quite bland.

Feel: Light, refreshing and smooth. It's quite drinkable for a hot day to quench a thirst.

Overall: As an easy sipper, post lawn mowing beer, it does the job. You're not expecting to get much from these mass produced, globally found Mexican lagers like Dos Equis, Sol and Corona. I find it to be slightly better than the aforementioned too, only beating Corona as it's overpriced for what you're getting."
Worst,Dos Equis Special Lager,2.6,"Appearance - Pours a very light transparent gold. The one-finger thin white head quickly dissipates.

Smell - Notes of grain, bread, and not much else. Light on the aromas.

Taste - There is a single note of fermented barnyard hay. The aftertaste is mild bitterness that quickly disappears but the tingling carbonation lasts a while. It resembles light beer. Very easy to put down but not much flavor.

Mouthfeel - Thin, very thin and watery. A complete letdown.

Overall - I drink this often because my wife likes it so it is always in the refrigerator. I don't hate it but it is a very light, one-note beer. On a hot day, it goes down easy like water but leaves me wanting far more. If it were cheap, I would not be as harsh on it. Truthfully, this is a beer for folks who don't really like beer."
Worst,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),2.57,"Had it at a restaurant looked funky didn’t recognize the name.

Pours a straw yellow colour with small head that leaves no lacing.
Smells of lightly bready malt and literally nothing else.
Tastes of malt and not a whole lot else. Tastes like the copy paste lager.
Mouthfeel is light with medium-high carbonation.

Overall, this doesn’t have that Pilsner pop that you’d hope for but it’s also a lot better than the American industrial lagers so I’m not going to bash it at all. Not sure what I expected when I got it since the beer selection was very industrial/uninspired. Should have went with wine I suppose."

Moderate malt sweetness, bready and well balanced by a light touch of hops bitterness. A nice touch of lemon and grassy hops spice in the finish.
Light, crisp and smooth at the same time. Good moderately gentle carbonation, not too fizzy.

Worst,Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),3.32,"Review: 33cl green bottle of Tuborg Pilsener (German version): ABV: ; 4.9% vol

The Germany-brewed Tuborg “Premium Quality” Pilsener. Coming in a nice looking green bottle with a rather distinctive logo. The crown representing the fact that the beer was “official court supplier of the Danish court” since 1914, as they state on their website.

For the appearance, initially looks pretty good, all sparkling with a nice head of foam and a lovely golden colour, but boy does it go all flat very quickly with the head not lasting too long.

Has a faint lagery smell, a bit malty and sweet, nothing amazing on the nose.

On taste, I got nice big mouthfuls at the start that were a bit hoppy and I could really feel the grains, not a bad initial taste.

The beer has a nice kick to it. Fruity, sweet, bitter, grainy, malty.

Taste a bit of corn as well. Not a bad tasting beer, slightly a bit too overboard with the hops perhaps, as it is a lager after all?

Not a bad tasting beer. Yeah not bad. Lagery taste with a slight kick. Bit of an aftertaste as well.
I feel the beer stops short of developing into something special, and for this reason I would like to try it again to give a better opinion. I have had it on draught and have come to the same opinion. I really am not sure if I like this beer or not, it always stumps me!"

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a gold to deep golden body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The aroma is sweetish and just lightly grainy; it's obvious that this is an adjunct beer. The hops are as expected: light, non-specific, and in the background. The flavor follows pretty closely. It's lightly sweet and threaded through with delicately spicy and herbal hop notes. There's also a delicate apple-like fruitiness to it. As far as bitterness goes there's just enough to balance it and it teeters on becoming sweet. It finishes with a drop of sweet malt and apple lingering, and then some emerging hops as the malt erodes. The head dropped fairly quickly althought plenty of fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily below. I'd say that's about average, and the lacing follows suit. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and gently crisp. All in all it's not bad for what it is.

Worst,Molson Golden,3.28,"Molson Golden is perfect beer before Oktoberfest. From when it gets hot, in N. Hemisphere, around memorial day to labor day this beer quenches your thirst, leaves a nice crisp up front flavor then a corn and hop finish. Drink this ice cold in July and August. But when September rolls around it is change to another beer. At middle of September I stock up on Oktoberfests since they are best and seasonal. Granted you can get Molson Golden all year round, and I did get a case of this in winter, but this is a summer beer. I wish Golden was a 5.5 or 5.7 at only 5%abv it is on par with Labatt blue, granted different flavors. This is a typical adjunct lager that is designed to be consumed with speed. This beer reminds me of fishing on 1000 islands in a boat which is illegal in Canada. Good times. I say 3.25 overall but certainly not ""poor"" this is a good beer and deserves respect for being a good macro. I know the men with man buns would argue that IPAs are better blah blah blah, but for an import and being a beginner beer for the 16 to 20 crowd down the tracks, or in the woods this is a tasty beer. I guess the use of corn makes it cheap too but for a Adjunct lager this is what is expected."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.6,"Drank ridiculous quantities of this in college in Rochester. Molson dominated there. We used to fill the bed of a pickup truck for bottle returns weekly. While fond memories and nostalgia drive a likely higher-than-deserved rating, I do believe this still tastes okay, and quenches the thirst, on a hot summer day."
Worst,Molson Golden,2.46,"I cannot believe I've never reviewed This old time classic. This Beer was once regarded as the high end of Imports, my dad and older friends really thought there was something extra special about Canadian imports...maybe there was circa. 1993?? I don't know, but it really did seem exotic to be when I was 16.

Soo here we go.....
It couldn't be more clear gold. Watery, pale gold. Thin, scattered white foam lace.

Sweet corn and green hop with sour, yesstie aroma all over.

Subtle, clean...easy feel like water, but with fermented canned corn and wheat. Crisp bite, then smooth with a green, corn, wheat and long malty flavor. Subtle, easy, mundane.

It's a $7.00 6 pack bro!"
Worst,Molson Golden,3.3,"Molson beer in Canada is better and different than what gets sent to the USA. It's a bit more hoppy, crisp and very fresh tasting with a some more bite than the US version. Even in the 1980's I had long neck bottles in Montreal and I enjoyed the light taste of Molson."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.27,"Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is straw, transparent, head is off white and presents with less than 1 fingers worth of head, then dissipates to nothing but a ring along the glass.

Smell is sweet corn, adjunct and a nice grassy hop kick.

Taste is adjunct, basic macro lager, some corn, limited hop character.

Mouthfeel is high carbonation, moderate sweetness, low bitterness but sharp carbonic lingering bite.

Overall a decent macro lager, the sweet corn/grassy hop kick is enticing and the adjuncts are not awful."
Worst,Molson Golden,2.26,"Poured a clear pale yellow with a half - finger white fizzy head that disappeared in seconds. There is very little visible carbonation. This bottle is without a nose. Taste of slight corn sweetness with a tiny hop finish. Moderately full body with light carbonation. Very disappointed in this beer, which I have not had in over 30 years, and I use to like. I remember MG had a lot more flavor, head and aroma. This is not worth the calories."
Worst,Molson Golden,3,"12oz green twist-off bottle stamped SEP2721 poured into a vintage bowtie glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on label.

The taste is semisweet & barely tart with minimal bitterness and noticeable diacetyl. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, poor. Not clean, with no noticeable malt character. Label says this is made in Golden, CO, assuming by Coors."
Worst,Molson Golden,2.62,"Molson’s attempt at a euro lager, basically. A good bid. Tasty brew that can be sucked down in rapid fashion or sipped with intention. Either way, a decent lager with some euro skunk and subtle hop bite. It’s a beer."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.06,"L: pretty standard, gold color, small white head
S: skunky funk and malt
T: malt, crisp when cold, and bread
F: very nice carbonation and palate cleansing when cold

Overall, a decent beer that goes well with fatty, white meat like chicken (especially wings) and maybe pheasant or sausages, etc. Not much alcohol bite. Good carbonation. Best when cold. Don't bother pouring from the bottle into a glass except to evaluate."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.55,"625 mL bottle from the LCBO, featuring a gaudy golden foil neck wrap and plastic shrink label, coded Mar 16 2020. I could be wrong, but I don't think Molson Golden Ale has been available (in this part of Canada, at least) since well before I was legally allowed to buy alcohol, so it seemed like a good Canada Day pick.

Pours bright, sunny golden-yellow, topped with nearly an inch of puffy, foamy white head that settles off within several minutes' time. A generously frothy collar and thin cap remain in place, with a fair amount of lace also flung about; looks great to me. I don't have too much to say about the nose - it leans toward the sweet side, with gritty, whole grain bread and pale malt sweetness making up the bulk of aroma. Hints of grassy hay and corn sugar; smells more wholesome than most macros, I suppose.

A very solid macro lager, or golden ale, or whatever you want to call it, tasting mostly of grainy pale malts and bread, with just a little bit of sweetness. Hints of grassiness towards the finish, with just a faint touch of lemon; a clean aftertaste, cleaner than Canadian for sure. Light in body, with a smooth texture and moderate carbonation levels, resulting in a very quaffable brew.

Final Grade: 3.55, a B grade. Molson Golden is a serviceable macro lager... or golden ale? Or perhaps a lagered ale? I mean, 'ale' is on the label, but that leaves plenty of room for interpretation. Whatever you want to call it, it's fine for a macro product, though I will say that the label and serving format are also kind of tacky and out of place, at least for something so uninspired... then again, I guess it's still better than a green bottle. Put this in a 12 pack of longnecks and I'd pick it over Moosehead or Molson Ex, which are currently my default ""backyard campfire"" rations."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.5,"This is the 2020 re-released version of the classic Molson Golden. I’ve had a few Goldens in the past but that was way before I joined BA. This one pours a nice beautiful golden colour. No shit. A nice head and lacing for a Molson product. The smell is grainy and corn, typical of a macro beer. Taste is ok, better than expected, but still your typical Molson product. Sweet and adjuncty. Mouthfeel is adequate, with nice bubbly action. Overall a good Molson beer if that’s saying anything.

Worst,Molson Golden,2.92,"Up here in the midwest(oH), Molson and Labatts are as cheap as just about anything the macros have to offer save keystone, or natty, and i dont typically go under the 5$ a six mark unless its a PBR. For that 5-5.99 range for a six, or 9.99 a 12, THIS IS my beer of choice!!! Very solid brew! Grain, biscut, and honey, with a clean pleasant aftertaste. It’s a little on the sweet side balance wise and for that reason I believe is a little more hangover inducing if drank in large quantities, but if you’re going for bang for your buck, taste for you buck, this lager, unlike many others in this price point, does not have any off-putting flavors or aftertaste; nothing cloying you’ll like today or hate later. It’s just a solid masspro adjunct lager that is a poundable, straight forward lager with a little earthy sweetness and just enough clean bitterness to balance it out. If it could avoid the typical whispy big cell and quickly gone head like its predecessors and competition - i’d call it damn near perfect, for what it is of course. I much prefer this over Molson Canadian, which i like but find a little more sour and bitter and less poundable than this."
Worst,Molson Golden,3.94,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a ""nonic"" pint glass; bottled by May 13, 2019.
A: Pours a crystal clear, golden color with limited champagne-style bubbles, a frothy, white, one finger head, rim retention, and stringy rings of lacing
S: Aromas toast, biscuit, pepper, grasses and grains. Nice nose on this.
T: Dry. Palate follows the nose closely. Light bitterness, but enough to impart character and crisp, refreshing finish without astringency.
M: Light bodied with light, but steady carbonation overall. Refreshing.
O: Reminded me a bit of a PBR and that is a complement. Enjoyed it and would hesitate to have it again. As usual, the ratings on the AALs are ridiculously low."
Worst,Molson Golden,2.52,"I like the look of this one better than everything else about the beer. Nothing special about the beer, very smooth, not bitter at all. Light bodied and finishes clean. Pretty much a C- brew"
Worst,Superior,3.47,"300mL bottle BBD OCT 2022 poured into a vintage bow tie glass at fridge temp 4.6% ABV. The beer pours bright light gold in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a pencil thin ring and island. The aroma is slight with a hint of malt. The taste is semisweet corny, slightly tangy malt with a side of vague vegetable and negligible bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Diacetyl is present to a noticeable degree. Overall, fair AAL."
Worst,Superior,2.99,"Poured from the 300mL bellita bottle (which is in fact the same beer as regular bottled superior) this bottle also says its 4.6% not 3.6%. maybe the 3.6% is alcohol by weight.

The look is like any other adjunct lager, has a light head that fizzles down over a few minutes into a few clusters of floating bubbles. Very light not a lot else going on here average carbonation. Crystal clear.

The smell is very vague, with a sweetness and hint of hops but nothing that really stands out.

The taste is similar to the smell, but with a stong corn flavor. No bitterness basically just corn with lager flavor but easy to put down and nothing necessarily offensive. Would be better if it was colder. Right at the front there is a mineral flavor that isnt the best but doesnt really get in the way. Pretty boring.

Feel is denser than you might expect, but still could be a beach beer, but not the best work beer. Maybe good for drinking on a summer night ice cold, but it better be cold. Quite sticky as it warms.

Overall it's a cheap mexican lager with a bit too much corn. Wish it had a bit more gops to balance it out. I suppose balance is the main thing it lacks. All it there is here is corn flavor and I'd appreciate it if there was something more, but if you find it for cheap in the full size I would still give it a try."
Worst,Superior,3.03,"clean light adjunct lager beer. in taste and appearance, very comparable to amstel light. so happens to be another product in the heineken portfolio. for what it is, albeit remove the import price here in the us..... and also the small 10.14 fl oz bottles, the beer itself is a good product. ymmv."
Worst,Superior,3.5,"Not bad ... Its similar to victoria .. I drank 6 10oz bottles with no complaints .. It is what it is , this ain't no beer for pouring in a glass and pondering nuances"
Worst,Superior,2.29,"I mean Mexican beer is pretty bad right out the gate, this stuff takes it to the next level below. I actually like drinking a Modelo from time to time, not bad in terms of light beer. So I tried this one thinking hey it's probably like a Modelo. It was cheap, $2.50 tall boy so what could what could go wrong? Pours a golden color with a decent fizzy head, nothing on the aroma side but you probably already assumed that. The taste is more soapy seltzer than beer - honestly this stuff doesn't taste like any kind of lager I can think of except maybe Michelob Ultra which is a whole other story. Check it out if you dig Mexican lagers otherwise grab a Modelo and some hot Cheetos."
Worst,Superior,3.3,"24 oz can from Plaid Pantry
4.6% alc now.
Clear corn oil coloured body. Head is actually quite impressive. Huge billowy/rocky white.
Aroma paper and wet hay.
Taste more of the paper and hay and some white bread .Not as bad as the aroma suggested.
Mouth feel is thin,. well carbonated.
Not the worst Mexican lager."
Worst,Superior,3.1,"Clear pale gold with three fingers of white head. Splotches of lace are forming as the levels drop.
Smell is corny and sweet.
Taste is sweet corny and just a pinch of spicy hops.
Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. The finish is mildly dry and mostly sweet.
Overall a nice enough cervesa. Best by date is Sept. 2021."
Worst,Superior,2.81,"Clear yellow colored beer with a wisp of a white colored head.


Smells sweet and fairly corny. Toasted grain scent. Faint noel hop scent, mostly it is grassy.

Starts out Neutral. Mildly sweet and tasting of Mineral Water. Mild bitterness. No real hop presence. Bland.

Mouthfeel is watery.

Overall just a beer. Sees no reason to ever try it again."
Worst,Superior,2.87,"Look: Crystal clear pale yellow with a billowing white head that slowly craters to a lid, leaving behind great lacing
Aroma: Light wafts of pilsner malt, cracker-like malt, floral hops, and cereal grains
Taste: Sweet malt and grains come on strong followed by some light but welcome floral notes. Honestly, this didn’t seem like it would be this sweet from what I read from the nose. As that fades, a little corn comes in and finishes with more grains
Mouthfeel: Light but fairly full, a little cloying from the sweetness, somewhat clean and crisp but the sweetness definitely takes from that
Overall: Ehh, this isn’t terrible but it’s far from good as that sweetness really detracts from what I assume is coming with a cerveza – crisp, clean, and light. I’d never heard of nor seen this beer so had to try it, and at $2.99/24oz can, it wasn’t an expensive gamble, but I’d grab a Modelo, Bohemia, Victoria, or Tecate every single time over this"
Worst,Superior,3.2,"Appearance: Clear lightly yellow goldenish. Smell: Not too noticeable; thin corn, I guess, like a beer, though. Taste ain't too bad really; has almost a touch of a sorta simmering sweetness in it. OK on the feel. Overall, it's a nice, easy, simple beer to just take a moment or 2 and enjoy. Dribble a real small salt splash to it, though.
BTW, the can I drained it from sez 4.6% Alc./Vol. MUCHO better that 3.6, SI?"
Worst,Superior,2.78,"Superior 4.6% has a thin, white head, a clear, straw appearance, with lots of fairly large white chunks, suspended, throughout. Lots of glass lacing left behind. The aroma is of a sharp spice note, of some sort and a strange green apple or grape skin smell. Taste is somewhat muted, but one will pick up that odd grape or apple thing. Mouthfeel is medium, and Superior Original finishes crisp and easy going. RJT"
Worst,Superior,3.64,"Serving Type: 355 mL Bottle

A- Pours a pale golden colour with a 2 finger white head. Surprisingly good head retention for an AAL. Nothing to speak of for lacing.

S- Light, Sweet malt and corn notes. Nothing in the way of bitterness. Doesn't seem to be well balanced going off of the aroma.

T- Sweet grain and corn notes from the aroma but well balanced with a slight spicy hop presence.

M- Medium body and moderate carbonation. Easy drinking without being watery (like a lot of AAL's tend to do).

O- No, Superior isn't the perfect AAL (is there one?) but it sure is tasty. If you're in Mexico (or anywhere else that it's sold), I recommend that you give it a try, especially over Budweiser, Corona, etc."
