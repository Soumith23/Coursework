Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.54,"I poured a 12oz. bottle into a 20oz. weizen glass and have ended up with two fingers of beautiful, frothy, dark tan foam. It slowly recedes but does not disappear as advertised! Typical stout look, very dark, one could say black. There is very thick lacing left all the way down the glass as I consume this one.
The aroma is malt first, sweet chocolate, and a little of coffee.
The sip offers a bit of sweetness, then it is quickly covered with the roasted coffee bitter bite and a bit dry to the finish.
There is not an alcohol bite here, but this one is a belly warmer. This is very thick creamy stuff with very light carbonation.
Good stuff, I do not take much time between sips, this one keeps calling me back. Be careful, at 8.3ABV this bowl of oatmeal may sneak up on you!"
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.5,"Yay!! Finally got a chance to taste this one.

Poured a blackish-brown color with a small head that quickly dissipates. The smell was of coffee and chocolate. The taste was of very strong coffee and chocolate, but mostly coffee. Definitely a good morning starter."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4,"Moderately sized head when poured bottle to glass, dissipates but remains at lower levels for some time, creamy appearance and lots of lacing. Beer itself looks like black coffee, no light may be permitted to pass through. Coffee and chocolate present on nose, coffee more so. Sweet bready characterstics as well. In flavor the coffee is much stronger, almost overpowering but not too extreme. Finishes long and remains on lips. Nice and creamy feel, when swishing, movement of liquid is difficult to perceive, almost envelops the tongue. Pretty nice, wish I liked coffee."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.31,"Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is very good.

Smell: The strong smell of coffee and chocolate dominates the aroma.

Taste: It has a dominant coffee taste with a decent deal of bitterness going down. There are roasted elements as well.

Feel: It has a full body and a good amount of bitterness in the finish.

Overall: This is a great coffee brew."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.49,"Drank early this morning, and wrote this on a napkin. Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Motor oil brownish-black, with a fluffy and viscous two-finger khaki head. Lacing is excellent.
S - Reminds me of the coffee from Dynamite Roasting. Bittersweet chocolate. Roasted oat.
T - Matches nose, with a bit more complexity. Definite ethanol presence, but the flavor of it never comes through (a good thing). Super toasty. Bittersweet throughout. More coffee-heavy than chocolate-heavy.
F - Thick. Heavy. Full-bodied, with little carbonation (if any). A sipper.
O - Probably not the best idea to have this for breakfast. A prime example for an oatmeal stout. Definitely recommend trying this one, but I won't purchase one again (not too into heavy beers)."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.68,"Pours almost black with a thick cream colored head that diminishes with time but never disappears.

Aroma of rich coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.

The taste is coffee tempered with a splash of milk and sweetened with dark chocolate just enough to take the edge off on top of a bed of dark roasted grains.

Every sip is rich and full.

Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee. Other coffee stouts often have too little coffee flavor, or sometimes too much, but this one nails the balance."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.68,"A little bit too sugary and carbonated for my tastes, but a world-class drink nonetheless. It will definitely be my go-to if I'm in the mood for a coffee/oatmeal-style beer."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.87,"I have chased KBS and CBS for a year now. If I had know how good this beer was, I would have been buying it up instead! Lower ABV, but all of the taste and feel of either of those. A little less complexity, but this is a great beer!"
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.47,"12 oz bottle
Glass: snifter
Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)


Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.

Smell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.

Taste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.

Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.

Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act."
Popular,Breakfast Stout,4.29,"A - Dark brown / black pour with bubbly, creamy, toffee colored lacing.

S - Big chocolate and coffee roast aroma along with some char.

T - Follows the nose to a ""T"". Coffee roast and chooclate char dominate this beer from start to finish along with some coffee bean and Espresso underneath. Ends with a lingering chocolate coffee char on the back side with some toast cocoa popping up at the very back end.

M - Big medium to full body with just a slight bit of thinness around the edges.

O - This beer continues to be fantastic, not sure what took me so long to review this after drinking it for years. (As I scratch my head.)"
Popular,Breakfast Stout,3.87,"L - June 2021 batch poured in January 2022 from a bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50- 55 degrees. 3/4ths of a finger light tan head. The beer is extremely dark and opaque. The head leaves a nice lacing that lasts for longer than most.

S - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell.

T - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.

F - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.

O - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,3.9,"Appearance: Pours a rich, golden reddish amber color, with a thick white foam head. Good retention and leaves behind some sticky lacing.

Aroma: Sweet bready malt and pine. A subtle touch of citric fruit.

Taste. A pronounced maltiness followed by hoppy layers of citrus and pine. Some bready biscuit notes. Malt backbone and a bitterness that starts half-way through, and rides all the way to the end. Finishes fairly clean.

Overall: This is one interesting, well balanced beer."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.35,"First review here goes.
Glassware used - Lagunitas pint glass
Appearance- pours an amber color with a 1 finger foam head.

Smells sweetly like of caramel and apples.

Taste- taste of malt and breadiness fades Into a minimally bitter finish."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.73,"Something they did with the hops and the malt... the BITTER is SWEET. Like, simultaneously. They are one.
Poured from can into my lucky pint glass and paired with cooked-from-frozen orange chicken.
Amber colored with 3-finger, long-lived foamy off-white head. Smells lemony-piney, reminds me of Murphy's Oil Soap... that's a compliment, I promise, I used to be a housekeeper. Precisely zero complaints on look, smell, or taste. I do wish the foam would cut it out a little so I wasn't getting half a mouthful of it every sip, but you can't win 'em all. It is very pretty, at least. Top notch IPA."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,2.6,"So bitter! Also, the color looks off and the bubbles are too small. I understand this is highly rated but it is not to my liking. Beer buyer beware!"
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.17,"Look: Rich amber-red with a formidable eggshell head that erupts on the pour and holds as a pillow, slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Pine needles and sap, grapefruit, fir needles, orange, raw hop cones, and some bready malt
Taste: Starts out with layers of pine and hop cones that pile on one another for prominence and followed by nice notes of freshly baked bread. Citrus fruits peek in once the conifer barrage settles down and mixes in before pine and fir return for the close
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, and a decently dry finish with zero hint of the ABV
Overall: This is good stuff and a classic. One of the first DIPA’s I had 15+ years ago and cool that they still make it and in stovepipe cans to boot. C-hops are prominent and the strong malt presence showcases this as an old-school DIPA, which I like. Tasty and fun to try again after many years"
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.71,"Poured out as a copperish color with a foamy head that slowly subsides.
The smell is of malt plus a nice hoppy aroma.
The taste is that of malt, hops, and what you expect from an IPA - Imperial.
Definitely one that I will be getting again."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.23,"12 oz bottle from a 6 pack. Right fine IPA. Balanced bitter & malt. It’s got the look, the pungent aroma that non-IPA people hate, a nice long finish. Recycle. Repeat."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.35,"Looks and smells good. What matters most is taste and this is not a light weight, which it isn't supposed to be. Heavy on the malt would be only criticism. Almost prefer the 60 minute if only because I can drink two in succession and save some calories, which you can do with this 90, however two of these and that ends the session for me."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.26,"Large format 19oz. can with NOV 2022 stamped on the bottom.
This pours a beautiful, medium orange-amber color, gloriously clear with a tall head of off-white that peppered the glass with lace.
The aroma is less than I remember - more citrus than 20 years ago and less malt sweetness in the nose. Some caramel and grain notes are there but not the blast of scents this had when produced, in smaller, more lovingly made batches.
As it warms and I swirl, more floral hops come forward as well as some more grainy wort.
Flavor is much better than expected - not as rich and malty as I recall but firm in it's malt character if a bit less balanced.
Hop flavors from mid/constant boil seem less, this that when it first came out defined the term ""juicy"" for beer.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin but just fine for style and maybe the only improvement over the first few years when it was a bit on the heavy side.
Finish is mildly and pleasantly alcoholic complimented by lingering grassy hop flavors and bitterness.
This still has good balance and hop flavor w/out sacrificing malt character. Not bad for a big batch beer.
A previous reviewer said "" Old school goodness"". I couldn't agree more."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.51,"Amber, with good clarity. Head pours moderately thick (about a finger), and is an off-white eggshell color. Fade to a persistent cap with little lacing.

Aroma is initially malt. Thick, sugary barley. Floral hops, sweet pine, lime peel, then toffee. Going back in, I get grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin oranges.

On the palate, it's thick, sweet malt. Toffee, caramel, sugar, dried fruit, and candied orange peel. Sweet piney resin. Lasting bitterness. This is about as close as you get to a barleywine without crossing over.

The taste and aroma continue to evolve as it warms. The malt becomes more prominent, but it always finishes with a pleasant piney bitterness. Overall, this is a delicious beer that is right up my alley. I love that orange hop flavor coupled with thick barley malt."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,3.58,"Clear orange amber brew is quite handsome in the tall goblet with abundant foam. Hugely hoppy and quite bitter, but not too unpleasant. Interesting dark roasted malty taste. Grapefruit and piney hops.

Distinctive woody taste. Just the thing to hop up some Blonde Ale I am stuck with. From the 19.325 oz can. A massive amount of this strong beer for a few bucks at a nondescript southern California liquor store. Dated AUG 2022, hopefully a ""drink by"" date."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.5,"Strong malt smell with some sweet chocolate. Taste is malt dominant with a mix of sweet chocolate, hops & some light citrus. This is a quality brew that tastes great!"
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.29,"12oz can best by date June 2022 into a pint glass.
L: Pours almost crystal clear amber w/a 1"" pock marked creamy off white head w/decent retention to a creamy skin. Random lacing and some sticky sheeting.
S: Caramelized malts, grassy hops, orange zest, a hint of bread. It is pungent, fruity & floral.
T: Citrus zest, black tea, caramelized roasty malts, grapefruit, fruit cake, grassy hops, lemon drop candy, a suggestion of brown bread, moderate alcohol. It is somewhat tart w/pine resin in a med-long linger. Powerful malts, bold hops and is full flavored.
F: Sharp, firm & smooth med-heavy bodied mouth feel that is lightly sticky and almost thick. It has a rather drying finish.
O: A full flavored American Imperial IPA that truly delivers an enthusiastic and unrestrained dense punch of malts & hops. It's taste is BIG and it is excellent in it's style."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.41,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IP Glass. Two finger off-white head. Pours golden and hazy. Decent lacing.

S - Bitter citrus and floral IPA scent

T - Taste is more complex than scent. Has some maltiness to balance the bitter floral and citrus. Very balanced for an IPA. Each taste goes back and forth between malt and hop.

F - Nice medium oily feel.

O - Top notch IPA. Drank the same night as 60 Min IPA. Both are wonderful beers that are definitely in my annual rotation. The 60 Minute is the IPA standard for me. This 90 Minute is a great premium version with more complexity."
Popular,90 Minute IPA,4.35,"Best by Jul 2022. Drinking feb 24 2022. Room temperature.

L: amber body, off white 2 finger head that becomes a ring. Good lacing.

S: mostly tropical fruit, some pine, a hint of malt.

T: a nice piney bitterness, grapefruit tartness, a touch of sweetness, and a bittersweet hoppy roasted malt finish.

F: a full viscous body, similar to a good barrel aged stout. Creamy and coats the tongue. Beautiful execution for a dipa.

O: an above average ipa in every aspect. The mouth feel was my favorite part, but there were no major weaknesses. Definitely a better ipa for malt centric beer lovers. Probably better options out there if you like pine sol flavored beer."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.68,"One of our Michigan beers, this is a staple, every party store and gas station has it, I like IPAs, this is bitter, I like that, it stays on the tongue, I like that.....
If you like this, try Huma Lupa Licius by Shorts."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.54,"American IPAs are rarely my first pick, but I think it's because I find myself wishing that every other American IPA was this one.
Gorgeous hazy amber color, and foams and laces beautifully- it's a very good looking beer. If it were a person I'd buy it a pint of itself. Smells piney. Actually drinking it does not disappoint. Flavor's got layers- good hops, pleasant little grapefruit and pine notes, all backed up by good malt. As for mouthfeel, it's good. I almost wish it was a little less carbonated, but would never suggest messing with the delicate balance of a beer so close to perfect. I'm a big fan."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.17,"Look is dark orange/amber, smell is of candied orange, hop resin, slight pine. Taste is more of the candied orange and hop bitterness. Really solid IPA, definitely a unique taste on this one in regards to the soft orange taste, very west coast IPA."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.3,"Pint can poured into a DuClaw Brewing pint glass at fridge temp.
Amber/gold color, slight haze, fantastic foam.
Using a distinct single hop (Centennial), Two Hearted Ale has a delicate orange blossom citrus aroma, assertive but well-balanced bitterness, and a lovely supporting crystal malt base.
Great everyday beer.
Goes well with anything."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,5,"Age: 4 months from packaging.

Look: A Touch hazy, not crystal clear. Amber in color and beautiful head of lacey foam.

Smell: Malty hops. Pleasant.

Taste: The surprising malty background blew me away. I love a good malt but to see it shine in a IPA was kind of nuts. I enjoy the taste. The malt and hops are balanced well.

Feel: The lingering malt feel on the tongue is pleasent. There is not a bitter bite to it like you would expect, its there but not enough that you couldn't session this beauty.

Overall: I love it really. Its going in my rotation. What Ive found is that after some hazy beer, double IPA, etc, throwing this malty IPA in the mix just completes the circle. Its great. Thanks Bell's."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,3.34,"Pours a hazy, deep yellow with very good carbonation and a light, airy head. Aroma is citrus and pine, with perhaps a very slight hint of grapefruit. Taste is light, largely bright, perfectly balanced between bitter and refreshing. The citrus comes through strongly, followed by pine."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,3.59,"I’ll start by saying that I am NOT an IPA guy. I’ve tried a few but just cannot appreciate whatever is going on with that. However, I heard the hype on this and wanted to give it a short. My initial smell is heavy of pine and citrus with just a hint of malt. The flavor is the same. I get a pleasant pine taste and it reminds me of a chilly fall morning sitting in a tree stand waiting for a buck to walk by. The finish has a mild malt flavor and a medium dry finish. It’s not too bad and the only IPA I’ve been able to stomach. I bought a 6pack just for my own edification, in hopes of understanding the genre better."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.9,"L: Hazy golden nectar with a small white head that dissipates into a film and a ring around the glass.
S: Yeast rolls, caramel, citrus fruit, pine resin, all the hallmarks of the best American IPAs.
T: Same as smell, but way more intense, as the bitterness is incredibly pronounced, as it should be with an IPA. Pine resin is popping out here.
F: Carbonation on the high side, but between that and the bitterness, the alcohol is very well masked. Medium heavy body.
O: Fantastic old-school IPA that isn't overly fruity or sweet. Highly recommend to everyone who wants a world-class IPA with no BS."
Popular,Two Hearted Ale,4.58,"Yummmm. this is a great IPA. The favors include an initial earthy taste, finished with grapefruit zest. I like this beer very much. I first had it in the Ann Arbor. So glad they sell is locally in MA. Even after 20 minutes, the taste and look remain."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.92,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. Head retention is good.

Smell: It has strong grapefruit and citrus aromas with some floral elements. There are very low stone fruit elements with a touch of grainy sweetness.

Taste: It has strong grapefruit and citrus flavors with some floral elements. It is very fruity with some light berry notes.

Feel: It is smooth and incredibly hoppy and bitter without any sharp bitter notes.

Overall, this is a wonderfully easy drinking beer with plenty of flavors and aromas."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,5,"I can't pin anything down! I love this beer though. So many different flavor notes and aromas!

You could chug it, but why would you do that when you can enjoy the flavors?"
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.14,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin sticky head with medium bubbles. Hard for me to get a sense of an aroma from this brew.

Tastes of bitter grapefruit, hops and orange zest.

Leaves sticky, layered lacing. Very hoppy going into the finish.

Overall great beer, not too heavy on anything, decent bitterness but not too overwhelming. I can definitely taste the hype."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.56,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing.

Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present.


Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

Overall: This is a unique brew to say the least. Layer after layer, the aroma and flavor complexity played a game of hockey with my senses."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.43,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.

S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.

T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.

F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.

O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,5,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!"
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.5,"Pliny is synonymous with California beer. Whether it be the Elder or the Younger, the name is a brand within itself. We found the Elder hanging around Lake Tahoe and gave him a go. The crisp, punchy, and herbaceous ale fills the glass with a heady aroma. It is an honest beer and sometimes that is all you need."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.74,"Had on tap. Looks slightly hazed gold color with 2 finger white head of soft foam. Head fell to a cap after a few minutes. Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,3.19,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Cheers. TBB."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.55,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, nice carbonation, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit, slight rind.

Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then a balancing shot of grapefruit bitterness. Stays balanced between sweet and bitter before the bitterness wins out in the finish.

Overall: Bottled 7/18, tasted 8/13. Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.4,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.

Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.

This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4,"I HAD BEEN waiting for years to try this highly rated beer, poured in glasss brillant yellow with nice head. refreshing taste. popped open an original Lienenkugel and a Yuengling lager/ they ere both more taseful"
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.44,"Pliny the Elder
Woodbury bar on tap Nonic pint

A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.

S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.

T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.

M- medium full body. Crisp. Hoppy bite.

O- Fresh drinkable IPA. No frills or quirky additions. Just a straight up solid IPA. I could see this as a go-to IPA if it was available. Definitely glad I finally got to try this classic brew on the last day of a SF trip.

Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.35,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.

Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.82,"Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.
The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.
Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.
Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.

This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.4,"The look is clear straw to golden with a nice off-white head. Lots of nice lacing.
Aroma is piney and malty with a little dank to it. Taste is lightly fruity, piney, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. The mouthfeel is very nice with good carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall a delicious west coast IPA."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.28,"Man, I have been trying to get a hold of this for awhile now. Finally got to try some this week. I wanted so badly to love it! Man is this stuff overrated. Unbelievable. It is a delicious beer, don't get me wrong. But as they haven't changed the recipe (I don't think) this stuff IMHO is not worth seeking out if you've had all of the good stuff. You will be underwhelmed. It is a piney, resinous, hoppy west-coast IPA. I found it to be a glorified Sierra Nevada Torpedo."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.72,"Absolute stunner. I will never understand other reviewers that claim this beer is in the past. Would you dare poop poo on a Tree House New England style IPA for being stuck in the past? For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!

I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.

There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River. Bay Area beer heads are blessed with those two and Cellarmaker, BareBottle, Revision, and Field Works, to go along with the San Diego breweries that make their way up there."

Popular,Pliny The Elder,4,"In this modern era of IPAs; this doesn't hold up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, it's a great IPA. I can see how a decade ago it was mind blowing. Today its very common place. Breweries like Revision and Alvarado are routinely cranking out IPAs that are much tastier. I'd def drink this all the time if it was more reasonably priced."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.6,"Russian River Pliny the Elder Imperial IPA, 8% ABV. Pours clear golden with 4+ finger off-white head that left huge foamy lacing. Nose is fruity and malty with light pine. Taste is fruity honey, lightly piney, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. Real nice mouthfeel with good carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall world-class. Should have bought more."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.3,"Took nearly 20 years to finally get ahold of a bottle, and this one is reasonably fresh, bottled 4/25/22. So, almost exactly 6 weeks from bottling.
Nice fresh aroma with a nice mix of scents with fruit and freshness and herbs and sweetness. More golden than many with a slight haze. Nice dense white head that settles some with some lacing.
Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well.
Body is only a little bigger than moderate but there is nice smoothness and richness that makes the feels soft and full. Not really sticky though.
This is good. And certainly worth the time it took to finally get one. I like the ""cleanliness"" of this. Not sure how else to describe it."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.68,"Poured from a bottle (bought in early Feb 2022) into a pint glass.

A: Clear, bright, straw yellow body. Frothy white head that sticks to the glass and leaves complex lacing.

S: Probably the best part. Very bright. A perfect blend of pine, mellow citrus, tropical fruit, and honey. It’s actually perfect.

T: The Simcoe hops really shine through here. A tad bit sweet and bitter but extremely well balanced. Does not leave a bitter or a cloying aftertaste. Fresh and sunny like morning dew on a pine tree.

M: Crisp and smooth. Leaves a clean mouthfeel.

Overall: One of my favorites beers I’ve had, certainly the best IPA. The reputation is deserved, well done to Russian River."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.64,"At Healdsburg CA, near the source, everyone serves Pliny (at weddings, Bardiva, SFO Uncorked, Mill Valley) etc, and it's tempting to stick to this perfect legend where it's so fresh.
a) Acres of lace over a perfect clear golden body.
s) Straw, sun baked grass, herb, hemp, over toffee malt,

f) That extra kick in the final swallow is interesting.
o) So glad to enjoy a week of Pliny on vacation."
Popular,Pliny The Elder,4.65,Was lucky enough to be at Monk's in Philadelphia when they threw this on. Pours clear gold. Smells piney resin and a little sweet tropical. Taste matched but piney flavors were more toned down and a tropical tone comes out. Balanced. Amazingly smooth to be this up front with the hops. Very drinkable and all around fantastic beer.
Popular,Heady Topper,4.46,"Canned on: ???? (Picked up fresh from the brewery, though.)

A - Very hazy medium orange gold color with a dense ring of creamy white lacing.

S - Bright citrus, citrus rind, dank pine, and earthy peppery citrus rind. ,

T - Juicy floral, citrus, citrus rind, a slight bit of peppery spice with some resiny pine bitterness on the back end. Finiand shes on the balanced side with a lingering mix between earthy juicy citrus and resiny pine.

M - Big medium body with prickly carbonation and bone dry on the back of the tongue.

O - Not, sure why I've never reviewed this before because I've had alot of it in the past. Final verdict? Enjoying this beer equally as much today as I did when I first had it. This Classic never gets old (IMO), just total all around class. One of my all time favorites."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.75,Pours a hazy gold. Thick foam. Juicy sweet hop aroma. Loads of dank hop flavors. Some sweetness. Some bitterness. Loads of juicy goodness. Not for the beginner but definitely very drinkable and a must have if you love IPAs.
Popular,Heady Topper,4.74,"Canned 8/18/22. Purchased that day at the brewery.

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.

S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.

T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.

F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.

O: Heady Topper takes no prisoners. An absolute hop smackdown that also showcases a wide variety of aromas and flavors. This is the DIPA for those who think west coasts are too bitter and hazies are too juicy."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.74,"I opened a pint can, bright citrus (mostly pineapple), pine and herbal hops greeted the nose. Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.

Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA.

Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.

Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?""
Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.

Popular,Heady Topper,4.75,"My second favorite beer of all time. Absolutely nothing but awesome deliciousness throughout. Unfortunately I live in Wisconsin, and have to pay my brother to send me 4 packs. I love the somewhat malty hopped taste, when you open a can it’s aroma is almost as good as the taste. It’s been around for years, yet with all the new brews coming and going, it has rarely met it’s match."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.15,"I’m not understanding the hype around this one. My buddy from MA sent me a four pack for my birthday so I have been dissecting this for a week now.

Pours a wonderful, slightly hazy dark straw color with an immaculate head.

Aroma seems a bit lacking. Sure it has hops but it isn’t overwhelming or any better than the other 100 IPAs out there. Kind of citrusy with a touch of pine.

It’s a little malty for my liking. Thick and heavy. The hop oils really coat the tongue. Bitterness is average, not too much.

It’s a good beer but not world class IMO."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.84,"Look: Yeah, I know, I poured it out into a glass – old habits die hard. Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt
Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite
Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish
Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen often"
Popular,Heady Topper,4.24,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.25. No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.

Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.

Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.

Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.

Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.

Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect."
Popular,Heady Topper,3.72,"Very difficult beer to find in my area. Luckily, there was what appears to be a one time drop at my local store - very limited amount. I scoffed two 4 packs. This is definitely a solid brew, but I don't find it all that drinkable. I was never able to drink more than one before wanting to move on to something else. Pretty one-dimensional to me - bitter, bitter, and bitter. I prefer a more balanced, multifaceted IPA.

If I come across some I will probably purchase a 4 pack, but it's not something I will be actively seeking out, there are plenty of other beers that I prefer over this one."

Popular,Heady Topper,3.84,"Maybe it's because it has been hyped, maybe it's because I drank it in a glass rather than from the can (as suggested on the can), but I was underwhelmed by this most hyped of IPAs...

It does look pretty good, has a very piney smell that just doesn't resonate with me, and the taste is full of that same resin that comes from pine. I suppose there are many that swear by it, but this just isn't what I was expecting from a ""world class"" beer. Mouthfeel was smooth, I do have to give it that, actually very smooth. Out of respect and acknowledgement I did give it an overall higher rating than I normally would, but in the end I'm walking away feeling, well...meh..."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.88,"I've been fortunate enough to have this multiple times and each time I'm impressed. Looks the part of a fantasticly crafted IPA. Pale yellow color with a nice murkiness. Smell is off the charts when fresh and bursting with pine and citrus. Just like the nose there is lots of pine and orange zest, but never overly bitter. Dangerously drinkable even though its a bit hefty in the body. I've had multiple in a night before and though the morning after was a touch rough, I didn't regret a single sip. Overall, this beer is worth every bit of praise it receives in my opinion."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.94,"Finally found the Holy Grail in Colorado. Unexpectedly pine-forward. I am sick of all those juice NEIPAs out there. This is a NEIPA style with pine, The perfect IPA. I bought 20 of these, and they'll be gone by the end of Memorial Day."

Fresh Heady Topper at refrigerator temperature poured from the can (!) into glasses. Slightly cloudy pale yellow body with a pure white cotton candy head. Aroma is powerfully hoppy, sort of reminiscent of the pungent Ballantine ale from Newark in 1971. Very good beer. It's hop flavor and aroma are accompanied by a lasting flavorful bitter aftertaste. For myself , I could use a bit more malt body, possibly with a little less alcohol. But this is a memorable modern IPA, probably the best one I've tasted."
Popular,Heady Topper,4.91,Best NEIPA I have had. Super drinkable and all around delicious. A light sweetness to the malts balances with a hearty hop bitterness and makes it more refreshing and easier to drink than I expected. Great beer.
Popular,Heady Topper,5,a little over a month old. tried some from the can but i preferred drinking from a glass to get a good whiff of the hops while taking a drink.

Popular,Sculpin,4.35,"Got this on draft.

Pours a clear golden color with a small head and moderate lacing.

Smells and tastes of malt and and peppery hops with some tart citrus.

Medium body and carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.

This is a classic west coast IPA"
Popular,Sculpin,4.41,"Just a bit of haze infiltrating the amber body along with a medium size white head and good lacing. After inhaling everything hoppy, from citrus to pine and everything in between, there wasn't much room for the malts to make a statement. Thought they might take a step forward in the taste, but nyet, still awash in all the hop pleasures. Bold and bitter right thru to the aftertaste. Full-to-bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that is so welcome after weeks of malty marzens and festbiers. Could easily pass for a DIPA."
Popular,Sculpin,4.44,"12oz bottles and on tap into a 16oz nonic pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly cloudy caramel amber with a 1.5"" off-white rocky head with very good retention. It is well carbonated right to the end of the pint. Some skeletal lacing and banding.
S: Apricot, peach, light pineapple, pine, raisins, light sweet bread.
T: Earthy apricot, sweet ripe tangerine, lemon peel, mango, juicy pine and toasted grains. It is fairly bitter with pine resin lingering throughout the finish and is moderately sweet and resinous.
F: It has a firm, lightly sticky medium-bodied mouthfeel that is smooth with a long finish. It is not jarring with hops yet they are bold and balanced.
O: I first tried this beer in 2008. A bottle pour produces a bit more foam than does a tap pour. It is an excellent full flavored hop-forward West Coast IPA. It's well balanced hop configuration flavors remind me of the children's breakfast cereal ""Fruit Loops"". It is very excellent in it's style."

This is one of those beers that I had for the first time very early on in my craft journey but never reviewed. From what I remember of my 21st, I had a lot of this and the grapefruit variant, and kinda just stopped going back to them after that. Not for any particular reason, but I started branching out since I had the options. So when I saw this and the grapefruit one lying around recently, I just had to pick them up, even though they were older cans they deserve a proper review

Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

Despite the age on the can, this is still in your face hoppy and fresh, which is really what drew me to this beer more than anything when I first had it. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, pithy grapefruit, coriander, lemon rind, biscuity malt, and light caramel

As I said, I recall the aroma being the high point, and the taste lagging a bit behind, but in this case I think it's the age showing a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, bready malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, and peach. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, and toasted grain

A light medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a slick yet firm beer. Finishes off dry and feels much lighter than the 7% it actually is

This beer is an institution for a reason. An absolute classic which holds up today, but I can only imagine what it was like for people to experience this one in the early days. A treasure of a beer that I think I'll have to come back to more often"
Popular,Sculpin,4.89,"This beer, is top tier IPA. It is very bitter, but with character and makes this one of a kind. Meant To wow all those who are tired of the same hazies, same ol imperials, whatever. This beer is unique. Look is obviously excellent, bright and opaque. As for feel, well it goes down with ease, with the feel of a superior beer. Carbonation, nuetrality, and taste that's what you need. If warm, it may not feel so great, due to it's strong flavor.

This beer is worth more than market. It really should be priced a bit more than it's competition, but it's not. So it's a great deal to boot.

Now, the alcohol. This beer hits you. It is totally reliable to make you extra drunk and fast. Be wary and believe me and my fellow Sculpin lovers. This is also added value. Ballast Point will go down in history for this legendary beer. My only complaint may be consistency. It's very strong IPA, so a bit more likely to get an off-batch once in a blue moon"

It's bitterness first but it's really fresh.  Then there is both citrus and pine flavored hops.  There is that little bit of malt as well.

It's thin but really foamy.  It's smooth and refreshing.  The finish starts off bittersweet but eventually is just bitter.

Overall it's delicious.  It's a refreshing fruity and bitingly bitter IPA.  I give it a 5.2 out of 6."

Popular,KBS,3.83,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, bourbon. Taste is strong of bourbon, some chocolate, a bit on the boozy side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I was expecting more based on the ratings here."
Popular,KBS,4.76,"Poured from bottle into snifter after about a day in the 50 degree wine cooler.
Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful
Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.
Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.
Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.
Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff"
Popular,KBS,4.44,"Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.

Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°

Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly!

L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom.

S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall

T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes.

F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth"
Popular,KBS,5,"Look: Poured from a 12 oz into a glass - Midnight black pour just like a stout. lightly thin/ brown foam risen to the surface. Quickly dissolves over time. A bit of lacing on the sides like some of these bubbles don't want to give up.
Smell: Getting the heavy notes of sweet bourbon barrels - getting some chocolatey vanilla aromas to it. Not much on the coffee side this pour.
Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!
Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.
Overall: This bad boy proves to live up to it's standards. Wasn't sure because barrel aged stouts aren't my route but this proved me differently. Will buy again and if you haven't tried it. This is a must try beer!"
Popular,KBS,4.51,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip glass. Bottled on 9/9/21.

L---Darkest brown color. Fairly thin light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left ok lacing. Head doesn't sound like much, but I think it's actually pretty good for the high ABV.

S---Strong chocolate, lighter vanilla and bourbon barrel. Not as much coffee as I was expecting.

T---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness.

F---Medium/full bodied with minimal carbonation. Almost a creamy texture with no alcohol burn.

O---I have been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. The best offering from an excellent brewery."
Popular,KBS,3.72,"I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.

L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.

S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.

T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.

F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink.

O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.

Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future."
Popular,KBS,4.45,"Beautiful color and head. Notes of chocolate. Slight coffee flavor while sipping. Very slight bourbon taste, which is fine. Very delicious, but not as rich as I was hoping or expecting.

F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Refreshing
O - an incredibly well balanced DIPA"
Popular,Hopslam Ale,4.47,"Canned 1-20-22
Perfect, beauteous pour. Deep amber color, transparent with reasonable chill haze and a firm, persistent 1/2 inch head of creamy tan foam that left full curtains of lace.
Aroma is a mix of rich malt and hints of woodsy hops. Sweet, caramel and honey nose with subtle pine and citrus hop notes are a welcoming indicator of the flavors to follow.
Rich and yummy malt flavors wrap around the conifer and leathery hop resins in terrific balance. Honey character comes through and the body leans towards a honey like texture and mouth feel. Okay, Not honey thick but your do feel the beer hug your tongue, leaving a slick, sweet coating allowing that depth of flavor to linger.... honey-like.
Hop bitterness comes in at the finish with a long and smoldering hop/pepper burn as the honey-malt dance twirls off stage.
Alcohol is always perceptible but never gets in the way or in any way harsh.
Expertly crafted, no un-needed wheat or oat starch, no unseemly and superfluous floculants, just a straight up damn good BIG beer.
Outstanding."
Popular,Hopslam Ale,4.75,"It smells really floral, citrussy and sweet. There's a subtly about the scents. Definitely the sweetness is from both the malts and honey. The citrussy floral notes are obviously from the slamming hops.

Sweetness is the first taste that occurs as it hits the palet but then really nice hoppy bitterness.

It's thin and has medium foamy carbonation. The finish is bitter, floral and sweet initially incredibly balanced but everything else fades and the bitterness remains drawing out for some time.

Overall it's such an extremely good DIPA. The hops are very strong but the sweetness of the malts and honey balance it out so instead of being extreme it's incredibly refreshing. One of my favorite DIPAs, it has an originality to it. I give it a 5.7 out of 6."

Popular,Hopslam Ale,4.37,"nice off white head but I expected it to be longer lasting for beer rated this highly. nice lacing. Less smell than I expected, but it just oozes ""complexity"". Less hop bitterness than I expected/more malty than I expected. .Medium to heavy body mouthfeel; very smooth, merest hint of the honey. Overall, not a lick of indication that it is 10% ABV. A very nice double IPA but not entirely sure it is at or anywhere near the top of my cost v. quality list for IPAs."
Popular,Hopslam Ale,4.53,"Decided to delete my old review so that this one shows as new ... copied the original text below for reference. Best beer I've had this year, don't know what's changed but been thru an entire case now ... amazing. Not Heady Topper, but I recommend drink from the can, or pour into a big glass and enjoy the ride. Looks good, smells fresh but the taste is the wow factor, Extremely hopped, with a great bitterness, drinkable, and 2 16's is completely satisfying, overall world class.

Edit 1/31/2021 This year's release back in bottles is very good, almost great, and I actually bought a sixer after my one single for the first time in many years. For me to spend $20 on a sixer, it has to be outstanding. Real bitterness. 4.25

Original 1/31/2020 Easily the most overrated beer on earth. And, yes, I still get one (some years even 2, a long time ago an actual sixer) every year thinking I will change my opinion. That's stupid, because I never do. Very mediocre and actually boring, even smelled a little bit like poop poured into my mason jar. Thank goodness, the aroma quickly cleared. Pretty golden color I guess. Smells decently of malt and hops, I don't detect the honey at all. Taste follows, fresh but way too mild. Overall boring as hell."
Popular,Hopslam Ale,4.5,Been drinking and loving Hopslam for years. This year the honey smell and taste was less than previous years but still found it to be an outstanding beer and one almost all beer lovers will enjoy.

S---Floral, very floral. Sweet, like honey.

A broad array of floral and pine hop notes on the nose. The honey, had I not known was there would have been too negligible to notice, but, knowing it is there, my nose picks up a smidgen.

Classically piney/grassy IPA on the tongue with a solid bitterness to finish the sip. The honey shines without adding any unwanted sweetness. Quite good.

Lightly effervescent with a full body.

This is excellent stuff. I’m thrilled to have finally tried a can and would definitely buy it in large numbers were I afforded the opportunity."
Popular,Hopslam Ale,3.86,"Not as intense as I expected. Smell is kind of muffled. The thing I like eat about it is the feel: smooth and a little syrupy going down, with some alcohol warmth after. The bitterness and sweetness are well balanced. Good sipping beer. I'll finish this four pack with pleasure, but I probably wouldn't seek it out in the future."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,"Stouts, especially Imperial Stouts, are my favorite style, so I try them whenever I can. Even though Bourbon County changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!
Every year, my friends and I buy up as much as we can get our hands on. And if you can find it on tap, I like it even better."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.84,"This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt.

Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head.

Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here.

Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""

Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)

I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.

I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,"A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.

S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.

T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer.

M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,

O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.3,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout
Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.
A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5
S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5
T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5
M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5
D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0"
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.62,"The grandaddy. I've had the 2012 variant most recently on a trip to Chicago. Held up surprisingly well. Still have a 2013 bottle hanging on in the cellar that I can't wait to open. Even ""bad"" variants of the original are so solid, reliable and respectable. Excellent experience every time.

Smell- Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.

Taste- Toffee, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, semi sweet.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mouth coating, mouth warming, smooth, creamy.

Overall- Vibrant and well balanced flavors with a full body that coats and warms the mouth. This provided a brilliant drinking experience."

Poured into a chalice-like glass. Color is a very dark blackish and brown mix. Thick and syrup-like with a noticeable alcohol aroma.

Smell is excellent and to me consists of chocolate, plum, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and of course, Bourbon.

The 14.7 ABV brings a nice, warm taste to the experience and I look forward to my next bottle.

Oh yeah, enjoy it with your friends or the family members and they will thank you for the chance to taste a great stout. I highly recommend this to everyone."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.95,This is a great beer and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. At 14.6% its very smooth and makes for a great special occasion beer. The only even slightly negative thing i could say about it is that it may be a slight bit too thick to drink at any time. If i was full i dont know that id enjoy one. In my opinion this beer is so good that i think people are now talking bad about it just to go against the grain and feel like they better than everyone else who likes it.
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.38,"Not much of a head. Very rich on the nose; bourbon, figs, cola, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine.
I understand why it’s a classic. This beer has some kick, but does so without becoming cloying or unbalanced. Not my favorite, but great nonetheless."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2.22,"It's obviously a good stout, but it's just too much for me. Very syrupy, very sweet. You get vivid notes of chocolate and bourbon and toffee yet none of it is enjoyable. It simply has none of what I look for in a beer, or even a stout."

L: Dark! Dark and thick as motor oil. Even the short head is caramel in color. It is beautiful!
S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly.
T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced.
F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully.
O: I love this beer. I scored it shy of perfect because I want there to be even more of everything I described. But maybe leaving me wanting more is what makes this beer so amazing."

S - Sweet up front. Vanilla. Cola and chocolate. Alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisin or cherry. Some bread scents in the back.

T - Sweet taste as follows scent. Lots of dark fruit (prune, date, raisin) up front. Almost the taste of a port wine. Caramel and vanilla in there. A slight wood or oak. Chocolate notes as well. Love the complexity of each taste providing a little bit different each time. Not boozy even after is warms up some further along like other high ABV beers.

F - Really good medium body mouthfeel. Lower carbonation from and aged Beer. Very smooth and drinkable at high ABV

O - This is a great beer. I know there are a lot of ""flavors"" in this line now, but I tried the base beer of the 2021 batch, and it was World-Class. Well worth picking up and adding to the annual rotation."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.36,"Delicious stout filled with oak influenced flavors. The one had the pleasure of consuming was from 2015, and the bourbon flavors have softened a little, doesn't seem as forward with the alcohol, just well married into the vanilla and oak flavors. Very soft mouthfeel."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.32,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!

Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.

The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else.

This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me.

Still, very good."
Popular,Old Rasputin,4.38,I got lucky. On the way home from disc golf league stopped at an cou country bumpkin gas station that has some decent beer there was a whole whole stack of this so apparently someone's drinking it I grabbed four cuz I really wanted a nice Stout a little worried it would be just too much but it's pleasant surprise not too high ABV for Russians not too sweet leaned a little hoppy cuz I think it's fresh somehow in this country bumpkin gas station store it wasn't old stuff good stout bordering on just a heavy Stout rather than a Russian this one's very well done and normally I'm afraid to go this high on the ABV but this is so heavy you don't notice it as badly there is a heavy cocoa bitter coffee hop that bounces back between those variables can't tell which one it is it keeps you guessing that's probably why it has a cult following

Popular,Old Rasputin,5,"I am impressed with this beer in every aspect. As most stouts are, this one has all the characteristics of dark chocolate and roasted special grains with the hops sitting behind it all to mediate and balance the blend. Being that high ABV beers are tricky to brew, covering the alcohol flavor with success takes trial and error. Absolutely one of my top favorites in the stout realm along side Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and Deschutes Obsidian Stout."

Popular,Old Rasputin,4.96,"Dark chocolate colored with good head. Smells of cocoa, chocolate, malt and strong stout. Tastes of a rich stout flavored mild cocoa malt and hint of bitterness and sweetness. A very good beer strong but not overpowering. Well done and strong to the finish! Wow!"
Popular,Old Rasputin,5,"COLOR:

Jet black, with a hefty mocha colored head that's about 2-3 fingers and lingers. This beer is as black as the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.

AROMA:

Smoked malt, molasses, figs, leather, cocoa, brown sugar, with a hint of hops.

Smells quite lovely.

BODY AND PALATE:

Tastes like it smells. Rich smoked malt that comes across as espresso and dark chocolate. A lot of the other notes show up, with a nice hops bitter note that doesn't overpower the rich bittersweetness of this stout.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's heavy mkay? Nice and creamy feeling, which is what I prefer in a stout or a porter.

FINISH:

This one coats the tongue and lingers. It develops oh so well, and lands on a curious whole wheat toast finish, which I guess I'm attributing to the malt, which is interesting and welcome. I love malty aftertastes.

CONCLUSION:

This is the gold standard of imperial stouts. It hits all of the notes, and ticks all of the boxes as to what I expect out of a nice stout. Every stout I try is compared to this, and most, unless they're milk stouts, fail to compare.

Black as sin? Check.

Rich as coffee in flavor? Check.

Thick and full bodied? Check.

Rich and complex without one note overpowering the other? Check.

Easy sipper? Oh HELL YES!!!!

Smacks you in the face with how strong it is? You betcha.

Only issue is the slight bloated feeling I get drinking imperial stouts. They're basically meals in a glass, so if you want a refreshing beer, might wanna look elsewhere. That said, this pairs really well with waffles, surprisingly.

Overall, for me, this is a 10/10 beer. It is my favorite beer of all time, and all stouts I compare to this, which I suppose now is an unfair comparison."
Popular,Old Rasputin,4.5,"L: jet black inky body, nice light head. Standard quality stout.

S: roasty, smoky, a hint of salted caramel, and ethyl. Weaker on the nose than I’d like but it’s good.

F: a little oily but not much. Coats the tongue a little and has mild carbonation. Not perfect, but rewarding.

O: I can’t wait to revisit this once the weather starts cooling off. A quality benchmark stout to measure all stouts against. Not my favorite stout, but definitely a classic."
Popular,Old Rasputin,4.13,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for 5-10 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: dark molasses, with cola highlights. Had to pour in stages, due to the 4-finger thick, dense, dark tan head

Smell: oats, dark chocolate, malts, and dark dried fruits

Taste: intense, dark roast coffee on the front end, with some slight lightening to a bit herbaceousness in the middle. Lingering notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate notes emerge in the middle as the beer continues to air and warm

Mouthfeel: full at the front, giving way to a syrupy smooth feel in the mouth. Good effervescence on the tongue, preventing it from becoming overwhelmingly heavy.

Overall: hot damn, this is a tantalizing beer. On look and smell alone, it gets near perfect marks. Taste was a tad bit too bitter for my palate, but it still had diverse elements to the bitterness that made it enjoyable.

Popular,Old Rasputin,2.73,"I'm really surprised by the reviews for this one compared to my own experience. Usually BeerAdvocate doesn't steer me wrong. And this beer isn't ""wrong,"" it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.

L: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood.

S: ""Generic beer"". I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...

T&F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No ""smoke"" as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.

O: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again. And judging it as a stout, it fails in many of the characteristics you'd expect."
Popular,Old Rasputin,4.5,"my 2nd try with this popular stout... before found it a bit too hoppy-malty bitter to my liking. but now... acquiring the taste a bit.

The bottling code begins with the numerals ""11"" so i assume this is the year it was sealed? Pours an opaque raven with a bubbly cocoa head, dissipated to a mist & menacing gauntlet of bubbles on the surface. Fantastic webbing that stays put! Aroma is like a pumpernickel bread with molasses... Taste is slightly sweet, but largely dry and deeply bitter from the hops & roasted malts... something minty overhead that reminds me of a peppermint patty?... Swallow is deep, bittersweet, nice body and not too sticky, coats the tongue.

Popular,60 Minute IPA,4.02,"Cloudy orange tint on pour with fluffy head and lace curtains forming. Aroma is hoppy, piney and dank. Floral start, citrus middle with a finishing piney bite. A little too bitter for my tastes, but a finely constructed brew. Prefer the smoother finishing 90."
Popular,60 Minute IPA,4.34,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IPA Glass. One finger white head. Light orange color. Hazy. Lots of lacing. Fades to thin head.

S - Floral and citrus. Bitter. Expected IPA scents.

T - Wow. The bitterness, floral, and citrus all blend down to a great mix. Holy moly this is smooth and easy to drink!

F - Just great. Light carbonation. Medium consistency

O - This is a world class IPA that sets the standard for me. The favor is so balanced. Other IPAs hit with too much of the bitter flavors that it's overpowering. This is is the IPA that I will compare future IPAs to. I definitely recommend it and will put it in my regular rotation."
Popular,60 Minute IPA,4.25,"Date on can: March, 2022

Pours a translucent, copper in color which turns gold when you hold it up to a light. A half inch of frothy foam sits on top that dissipates to a thin layer over time. Lots of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Smells chewy. Candied malts with a soapy, evergreen pine and citrus hoppiness. Taste is similar to the aroma. Lots of piney hops, a little bit of lemon/citrus and a lovely, sweet, bready maltiness in the background. Finishes bitter and a tad dry with lingering lemon and citrus rind on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and a touch of chewiness.

This is a superbly crafted brew, at one time probably one of the best IPAs in the U.S. It remains a very solid offering with a great amount of flavor and complexity, if a bit ""old school"" tasting. A great example of a hop-forward beer that isn't overly hopped. It is balanced quite nicely with a low-key malt profile that adds ample body and just enough counteraction to the bitterness. I'm surprised I never reviewed this, as I had originally tried this well over a decade ago. It's interesting to revisit it after all this time. Cheers!"

Popular,Pale Ale,3.86,"I will update this review. But, simply a fantastic warm to hot weather moderate ABV pale ale. Really good choice if you wanna great tasting beer without feeling the effects of 8 or 9%"
Popular,Pale Ale,4,"Hard to rate for someone who just got serious about beer a few years ago. All time classic. Very balanced. No off flavors. Also there have been so many aggressive, pushing the envelope beers that it seems quaint. Honestly I’d drink it any day, which is what matters."
Popular,Pale Ale,2.68,"I saw the the rating on this site, outstanding, so I decided to try it. What a flop, little carbonation and the taste doesn't last. On the plus side, full body and nice dark gold color. Overall, an average beer."
Popular,Pale Ale,3.64,"Thin brief rocky white head; poor cap retention; thin ring; no lace; deep gold/pale amber liquid with excellent clarity. Lemon grass nose. Semi bitter lemon peel; pine; firm malt base. Medium light body, moderate minus carbonation; no astringency. An ok PA; good balance; easy drinking with good flavor."

Popular,Pale Ale,3.98,Semi-clear amber color with a foamy head and some nice lacing. I denote yeast and light hops. Above average with a nice carbonation and dry finish. This Pale Ale seems to be good every time I have one. I recommend this one to my friends all the time.
Popular,Pale Ale,3.44,"This is a really pretty beer- dense froth, rich color, bubbles galore. Beyond that, I’m not impressed. Almost nothing on the nose. The taste is mostly bitter without a great finish. I like that they support NPR, but this isn’t a beer that makes the rotation."
Popular,Pale Ale,3.73,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50 degrees. Pours a clear amber color with an off-white 1/2 finger head on a tame pour. Minor lacing that doesn’t stay. Head quickly reduces down to a light film.

S - Pleasant pine hops and citrus zest. Very nice light flavor scents overall.

T - Taste follows scent. Sweet fruit zest paired with piney and floral hops. Very light and refreshing. There’s a nice sweet flavor that I can’t pinpoint that comes through as well. On second thought, it’s grapefruit. Very nice addition.

F - Not a lot of carbonation and a lighter mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a solid beer. Very good for regular drinking, and a standout for outdoors and camping. The sweet and bitter flavors provide a nice mix. I am by no means a hophead, but this is a nice, acceptable amount of hops and bitterness. It’s in my regular rotation and I would definitely recommend it to others."
Popular,Pale Ale,4.74,"Sierra Nevada pale ale was introduced in 1980, this is a historic craft beers of the world that helped shape the craft beer game that we know & love. This is also one of the first beers I've ever tried and the review will be a bit biased as a result.

Look: Thin 1.5 finger - off white/ cream color head and a cloudy orange in color.

Smell: Smells wonderful - citrus, barley malt, sweet piney aroma (I wish I could make a perfume out of this fragrance).

Taste: Very refreshing - hop forward with a punch of citrus and pleasantly bitter hops, piney and grapefruit notes, mild caramel-like sweetness and crisp clean water.

Feel: So smooth - Medium soft & fluffy ale body with a mildly sweet and semi-dry finish.

Overall, it's an exceptional beer!

ABV: 5.6% | IBU: 38"
Popular,Pale Ale,3.9,"Pours a deep-ish golden-orange, with a nice finger and a half, foamy white head. The head has lasting impact in my glass, lasting the entirety of the drink, well over 15 minutes. Long lines of bubbles run up the glass. Looks amazing. Thick generous lacing lines the entirety of the glass as it empties.

Smells of wheat, bread, floral hops with a touch of bitterness. It’s clean and fresh smelling. Some piney notes, notes of grassy straw. General zesty citrus in the background. It’s as clean and classic as you can get.

Some have described SNPA as a mix between an APA and an IPA, but this is just straight up APA for me with mild balancing bitterness. Gentle floral hop, grassy flavours wash over the tongue before revealing straight up sweet caramel malt, some tasty bready wheat notes, and the citrus I notice here, mostly grapefruit. Gentle but tasty. It’s so straight up clean that it almost feels more complex than it is. SNPA has never been described as the absolute boldest, biggest smash your face flavour beer, but it isn’t any worse for it. When you want that clean, crisp, yet flavourful and subtle APA, this is the taste you think of in your mind. It is your classic example personified in an actual beer.

It’s well carbonated but not super strong; resulting in a nicely smooth, mildly creamy sip. Subtle medium long finish, that leaves just a hint of bitterness and lightly roasted grains on your tongue. Finishes clean and semi-dry. It’s so easy drinking and clean I’d consider this light bodied myself.

When thinking and comparing this beer to others, I want to give it a higher ranking than I ultimately put here. There is more aspects to some beers than just the categories here. SNPA is a work-horse, a beer that can be easily drank all night, be enjoyed by quite literally every single beer drinker no matter what style preference you have, and is a super clean straight up benchmark of the style."
Popular,Stone IPA,4.51,"First actual American IPA for ages...never heard of this one before...

Amazing head...a little bubbly...intense colour.

Aroma is phenomenal...melon is dominating. But not as deep and complex as many IPA's or Belgian tripels...

Wowow...this taste is off the scale. After 2 pilsners this literally sets my soul alight. Mouth feel is like an explosion, one of the best that I have ever experienced. Sweet melon, followed by the bitter hops that literally assassinates the melon and creates a ying yang experience...

This is amazing and I totally love it. I'm buying all of the cans in the shop next to me that sells it. As soon as they open.

How could it be improved? I'm not sure...the ying yang between the melon aroma and the mega bitter aftertaste is unparelleled in my decades of beer tasting (drinking till I forget everything) ; )"
Popular,Stone IPA,4,Vintage in this category and still one of the best ipas ever brewed. Can’t really say anything that hasn’t already been said. Is it bad that I’m drinking one at $13 in Chicago airport at 9:55 AM? Kinda days it all
Popular,Stone IPA,4.16,"Pours clear gold, nice frothy white head that retains well, sip by sip lacing. Citrusy hop bomb. Medium body, xlnt carbonation. Bitterness is a quality hallmark for my taste, so Stone IPA really delivers, without going completely dank. Well balanced everyday quaff, plus it’s readily available everywhere at a reasonable price point."
Popular,Stone IPA,3.81,"A gift from Bret, with a connection to UCSB. Thanks! Really pretty to look at, but I don’t see the business of taste as all that special. I guess it is just too long on bitter without much extra nuance."
Popular,Stone IPA,4.24,"One of my early go to IPAs. After many years, I've found Odells, Ballast Point, and Elysian provide citrus and floral hop notes that I prefer depending on the mood. Stone has a special place in my heart, a bit one note and not the absolute best. The price is right and is still in the rotation, sometimes for the memories it conjures up. Don't change it Stone!"
Popular,Stone IPA,3.33,"It's a high quality, well made beer. Just not for me. The finish is bitter to the point of being off-putting. I just do not want to take additional sips."
Popular,Stone IPA,3.9,"Golden pour with a medium amount of head that dissipates relatively quickly. Odor is dank, hoppy, and piney. Taste is traditional IPA with hoppy bitterness and a slight bit of pine. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall a good IPA."
Popular,Stone IPA,4,"I revisit this one periodically, because at one time it was in my top 10 IPAs and I get nostalgic about that. Not sure if the recipe has changed over time, maybe it's just not been as fresh, I don't know... but I can only say it's a little better than okay in today's IPA world."

Popular,Torpedo Extra IPA,3.5,"Sierra Nevada and hops go hand in hand. What began as a crazy idea scribbled in a pub eventually became our newest year-round hop bomb, Torpedo Extra IPA. The first beer to feature our “Hop Torpedo”—a revolutionary dry-hopping device that controls how much hop aroma is imparted into beer without adding additional bitterness. Torpedo Extra IPA is an aggressive yet balanced beer with massive hop aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.

Lækker potent IPA, den er kraftig, men med en god balance. Den har en aroma af pine og citrus. God fyldig øl til den mørkegyldne side"
Popular,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.5,"Pours a nice dark gold to copper with an off-white finger of head that reduces to something like a bubble sea with some larger bubbles forming islands that stick around, leaving some nice lacing.
Smells of pine and citrus with a nice bready aroma hidden underneath
Taste follows the smell; quite nicely balanced hop-malt ratio... Resinous, slightly sweet, moderately bitter.
Mouth feel is medium-full; slightly above average carbonation. Alcohol is there but not overwhelming.
Overall a nice brew, but seems to be hit or miss at my location in Texas. Possibly temperature issues affecting some batches here earlier this year, but this current case dated 4//7/22 is definitely on point."
Popular,Torpedo Extra IPA,4.04,"Look: Nearly clear rich red in color with a dense and quick-forming off-white head that holds as a pillow, slowly settling and leaving behind nice lacing
Aroma: Oranges, grapefruit, pine, fresh baked bread, limes, fir needles, and the prototypical Sierra Nevada yeast phenolics
Taste: A rush of citrus fruit and rind start it off and start to mingle as layers of bready malt slowly filter in and join. Pine and fir flex some once the citrus subsides and closes with citrus rejoining the coniferous notes along with a big hop bite in tow
Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic and delicious WCIPA that drinks like its name as an ‘Extra IPA’ – bigger than an IPA but not quite in full-blown DIPA territory. Lots of citrus and conifer hop notes on top of an ample malt backbone and a welcome bite and medium dry finish. I haven’t had this in a bit but will now make a point to keep it in the regular rotation"
Popular,Zombie Dust,5,"When I took a swig I stroked out and saw a vision of the undead king, when I came to my underwear was wet and my tastebuds happy 5/5 I would get discombobulated again."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.56,"Poured an opaque golden amber color into a pint glass with a off white finger high head that dissipated quickly; dainty carbonation no lacing. Aroma is hop forward with earth and malt overtone that also offer some floral notes. Taste is bitter throughout with a slightly citrusy sweet finish that lingers. Mouth is chewy and flavorful, very satisfying. A little dark and hoppy for a pale ale, but oh sooo good! In fact it was so good I had to go back to where I got it and buy the remaining 2 six packs. First time I've seen anything from 3 Floyds in my area."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.49,"Look: It pours amber with a white head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: Strong aromas of grapefruit and citrus. It also has some support pineapple notes.

Taste: It has grapefruit flavors with some pineapple and mango. There is a bit of sweetness in the flavor. There are low background caramel notes.

Feel: It has a medium body and good bitterness to it without being sharp.

Overall: An excellent pale ale with plenty of flavor and bitterness."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.19,Not as biter as I thought it would. Not as bitter as bells two hearted either. Great liquid that goes down easy but still taste like an ipa. Malt and medium bitterness with a light body. Would buy again as a 6 pack for a campfire or something.
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.15,"Hazy, light amber color. Moderate bar pitted head which lasts throughout the tasting. Slippery lace leaving a minimum of streaks as the beer is consumed.

The aroma starts with a sweetness that reminds me of papaya and guava (in a word, tropical). The hop is mostly floral with a bit of black pepper thrown in.

The malt is dryer than I expected, certainly less tropical than the smell. The hop is more pronounced producing a bitter bite. The body is neutral as is the carbonation. Long bitter aftertaste."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.23,"12 oz can, about 2 months old

Slightly hazy golden color, thick off white head. Great head retention. Big citrus zest aroma. Taste is pretty citrusy too - orange, grapefruit. Fairly bitter finish. Medium bodied."
Popular,Zombie Dust,3.28,"Too hoppy.

A friend told me I had to try this beer. I tend to like some hoppy beers, but this one was just way too much to the point it didn't actually taste good."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.43,"Acquired in a trade with @Turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in June 2022.

Look: Pours a burnished, bright orange, with a white, persistent head. Leaves lacing on the glass as it goes down.

Nose: Oh yeah! Big, bitter hops, clean orange citrus, caramel malt. This is a throwback to the good old days!

Taste: Even better than the nose! It has a big bitter hop burn that's awesomely bracing. Flavour wise there's a dank resinous note that gives way to clean orange and pineapple citrus. The finish is uber clean.

Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.

Overall: This is a fantastic throwback to an old-school, big, bitter, citrusy pale ale. Great beer!

Cheers!"
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.27,"Not worth the high rating in my opinion. Tasted very much like a normal IPA. Rich orange color with citrus and strong hoppy aromas. Nothing different from what I’d expect from a regular IPA. Feels and tastes of a heavy malt with a smooth finish. The smoothness clearly gives it the edge, but outside of that not a 100 rated beer. On the positive side, double thumbs up for the artwork on the can! The Zombie King coming right out of a graphic novel gets a hard 5/5, but the beer gets a slightly above average rating."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.49,"Found this at the local beer store and they let me get just the one to sample at home.

Poured into a clear glass beer mug. Golden color with a nice white head that slowly subsides. The taste is that of a heavy malt flavor and a nice clean finish. I like it a lot and will be getting more to have around whenever someone drops by. Good job on this one."
Popular,Zombie Dust,4.43,"A rich copper orange with a big beautiful long lasting head. Canned 06/03/22 Zombie Dust reminds my nose of cold unsweetened tea. The taste follows the nose and it mimics uniced, unsweetened, strong tea and has that hint of bitterness like tea. Overall it's a good beer for a pale ale but doesn't seem as great as I've read. More to come. Will revisit. 07/19/22 Now my third of 6 Zombie Dust beers. The second one tasted much better than the first. Something was not right about it. These last two taste phenomenally better. So much smoother and doesn’t taste like uniced tea. Changed my rating to reflect that. Now has a bit of sweetness that lingers and I find that exceptional. Really good beer."

Popular,Enjoy By IPA,4.53,"Appearance:
Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc."

Popular,Enjoy By IPA,4.08,"Enjoying 1/1/21 version on 2/3/21. Unfiltered, but I would not have known except it was labeled as such. Smell is of orange, mango and banana bread. Taste and mouthfeel: Follows smell, citrus up front, creamy in the middle, with strong bitterness at end. But this is Stone. I've had better Enjoy Bys but the state of my tongue is always changing. Maybe I've had more good DIPAs since the first sampling of this beer.

Another DIPA (looking at you Hopslam) which appear regularly, but like an aging actor who has not realized younger and more sought-after options are grabbing the prime spots, refuses to lower prices. More people are passing. I saved $7 on this sixer by waiting two weeks after the Enjoy By date before picking it up. It was no worse, but not any better, either. And I doubt it was because I purchased it after 1/1/21."

Putting all of this series in a single is a bit unfair because each is unique and some are better than others.

Smells of malt and piney hops. Tastes of malt and hops in good balance. As the glass warms light citrus and floral tastes come out. Finish is slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.

Medium body with light carbonation.

I have had several earlier editions of this series and my recollections are they all were more adventuresome and unique than this one. It's not bad at all. It's a well made straight forward mild mannered strong IPA."

Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.2,"Picked up a bottle then realized it is a few months past the enjoy by date. I’m not sure how much that affected it.
Great strong ale. Reminds of some of the Belgians I’ve had. But the IBU’s on this one are too much. The bitterness kind of overwhelms the flavor."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.94,"dark amber, somewhat loose 1 finger head receding to very little. A bit of lacing. Smell is more malt than the taste. Much more bitter in the taste than I expected from look and smell. Clean finish, medium body, but thinner than I expected from the looks."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,5,"This beer is so good! This was one of the first brews that has extreme levels of hop IBUs that I ever tried, long ago...
Look: Expansive light-khaki colored head that extends a finger above the rim of my snifter, and leaves so much lacing, all atop a cloudy, deep crimson body. Smell is a bit of citrus on top of dark fruit, on top of a hop factory, with caramel drizzled on top of all of that. Taste is relentlessly hoppy, leaving hop resin in the mouth so very thick, leaving an extremely bitter aftertaste, that in my opinion, is quite pleasing. I'd be lying if I said this tasted like anything but a hop hurricane in the mouth. Mouth feel is actually very smooth for being such an abrasively hoppy brew. Carbonation is above average, but it makes this hop tornado so sparkling and delicious. ABV is all there, but I don't know of many people who drink strong ale that shy away from a little booziness. Overall a fantastically hoppy brew. LOVE it."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.09,"Older bottle just over a year but hopefully the darker color and abv helped it age. 22oz bomber.

On the pour a fine 1 finger head forms that slowly recedes to a very light covering and a ring around the glass. Light haze, and very dark, a murky reddish brown that lest some but not a lot of light through. Light lazy carbonation, no lacing.

Aroma is very nice despite the age. Some traditional west coast IPA notes and some nice floral aromas on top of an earthy chocolate caramel malt note. Some umami and a slight dryness on the finish presumably from the age, but it all ties together quite nicely.

Flavor follows the aroma pretty closely and introduces some fig and date dark fruit flavors followed by a stouty and hoppy bitterness. Still quite drinkable and smooth despite the bitterness nice and complex, lots of flavor but surprisingly balanced. And not as aggressive as the bottle makes it out to be, but perhaps that's just modern tastes talking.

Feel is quite big and chewy. The abv makes itself known relatively quickly too even when paired with food, and let me tell you 22ozs of 7.2abv will get you there, so don't be an arrogant bastard. Also quite filling.

Overall a beer that's big in every way, hoppy malty, mouthfeel, and abv, but without being completely overwhelming or gimmicky, although a small bit of both. It's a good beer for those who want big malts and big hops."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.84,I love this beer! So different from all the others. A nice hit of malts & hops with an incredible bitterness that really lingers. The sweetness of the malt comes thru more as it warms. That bitter aftertaste is so good.
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.22,"Look: Dark bronze/sapphire body with a head that reminds me of a latte. Lacing throughout.

Smell: Raisin bread. slight candied orange notes. Slight grapefruit. Citrus and baking spice if I had to sum it up. Complex indeed.

Taste: Orange zest, intense pine. Some fresh dark bread notes. Slight raisin, slightest black pepper alcohol burn on the finish.

Feel: Creamy body. Quite drinkable for a +7 % ABV. I can't imagine trying this beer on Nitro, I think it'd take it to the next level.

Overall: This is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Distinctly remember it being the early 2010's and becoming burned out on the typical West Coast IPA (ironic because it's come full circle and that's my favorite style yet again) and wanting to try something different. Then and now Bastard has been a refreshing look on a style I'd otherwise not consider. Just a really well-made beer. Probably not your every day brew, but this was a great ""random"" beer to have today."

Taste: Sharp and bitter hops up front. Malt contributes a bit of sweetness at the get-go but quickly shifts to a drier and heavily toasted taste. It's difficult for me to pick out any one flavor in particular. It's a complex beer but it's also a barrage on the senses. Rye comes to mind as does charred toast, peat, bitter tylenol-like hops and some oak. Heavily bitter all the way through.

Feel: Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry.

Overall: Not an easy drinking beer, but I didn't expect it to be anyway. I can totally understand how some people might not like it, but I've been a fan for close to 10 years now. When I want something to light up my palate I go for one of these. Well worth the money."

S: Very roasty. Distinct. Almost peppery. A little fruit in there if you squint your nose some.
T: Follows the nose, huge roasted malt character. Doesn't leave room for much else tbh, but a very tiny amount of sweetness sneaks in the middle before the hop bitterness and spice washes it away.
F: Arrogant
O: This beer is still in a class by itself, even now. I appreciate it but I don't know that I need to revisit it. A review of this one is no substitute for trying it yourself..."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.88,"I found this in the fridge and couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed it. It pours a dark brownish ruby color with an off-white head. The nose is primarily malt with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is almost identical, with the heavy grain flavor up front and ending with the hoppy bitterness. It must be my bottle, but it feels like the back end of the flavor is missing from what I remember."
Popular,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.29,"Dark reddish copper, clear, off-white head. Smells like toasted raisin bread, on the subtle side. Theres some light citrus notes as well. There’s an initial taste of caramel malts and biscuit immediately followed by a freight train of intense hop bitterness. You can vaguely taste some slight pine/citrus/spice from the hops but it’s mostly just early addition bittering hops that almost make it seem “hot”. No doubt about it, the labels right, if you’re a casual beer drinker or someone who is not very schooled in beer styles you will definitely not like this. It should be appreciated for how being a well made ale."

Popular,Celebration,4.75,"Not much to add that hasn't already been said. If you're looking for a true celebration of hops, this is the one to search for. Just enough bite from the hops, just enough grain to smooth, and just enough sweetness to complete the package. As close as an American IPA comes, to excellence in balance. As far as I'm concerned, this drink sets the bar to judge other IPAs."
Popular,Celebration,4.25,"Great looking brew on the pour -- red hue and a big pillowy head and thick rings of lace. Aroma is very hoppy and slightly dank. Taste is complex -- bitter, hoppy resin start with malty middle with some citrus sweet mixed in. Dry, slightly bready finish and bitterness wanes a bit as it warms in the glass. This is a really nice holiday brew that most hop heads and IPA lovers will like. ABV is what you would expect, but it isn't boozy. A well-crafted American IPA."
Popular,Celebration,4,"Poured from a 12oz can
On the pour the color is dark for an IPA, almost red, but still in the amber range decent head looks frothy with some bigger bubbles, fair retention. Very light lacing that doesnt love to stick around.

The smell hits as soon as you start pouring. Strong piny hops are strong in this one, definitely a wesr coast/traditional american feel on the nose. Malt is largely overshadowed in the smell, but on the back there is a hint of resinous citrus.

Taste is very strong and a classic bitter american IPA but the hop nuance still shines through beyond the bitter. The malt is much more present in flavor and imparts an amber malty sweetness carrying it along nicely. As a malt head myself I appreciate that. The alcohol is detectable bit not in a boozy way per se, more in addition to the hoppy bitterness. The bitterness does tend to stick around for a bit after a sip.

The feel is quite heavy I must say but it certainly warms you up as it should, as a winter seasonal. I can see this being a favorite for the ipa crowd for sure.

Overall a bit hoopy for my taste but I could see that coming, however the hop flavors are of very high quality and the piny hops are a nice touch for an interesting take on seasonal holiday beers."
Popular,Celebration,4.07,"A perfectly poured pint from the tap in the Pine Room.

Well done winter release from Sierra. Hoppy but not too hoppy, Bitter,but no too bitter, and an ABV that gets the job done without leaving a mark.

A really good IPA perfect for the holidays with family or friends.

Per the rules...kinda cloudy kinda not, smells like you'd expect, a nice fore shadowing before the beer hits your mouth...mouthfeel? Not too thin or creamy....a beer as you would expect a beer to feel."

Canned: 10/06/21

L: Pours a light amber with a big, white head that thang hangs out for a while. A good amount of lacing sticks around for the whole can.

S: Grapefruit, pine, malt, and sweet orange. .

T: Grapefruit, pine resin, good malt sweetness, and a nice bitter finish. Bitter orange lingers well after the swallow.

F: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky followed by bitter hop. It calls for a second sip.

O: Old school IPA. Great citrus-forward hop profile with a solid malt body. The prickly, lively carbonation dances on your tongue and helps dry out the heavy malt. The alcohol heat is just right and seems to kick in right at the end of the beer."
Popular,Celebration,4.42,"Canned 10/12/21; drank 11/22/21 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dark orange appearance.

A rough pour yielded a huge khaki head; frothy, tree-rung lace.

Strawberry, orange peel, fresh soap & faint pine notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Fruit punch, dry pine, mild caramel & faint fresh soap flavors.

Balanced but still very hop forward. I was blown away. This is a classic for a reason."
Popular,Celebration,4.33,"Cloudy copper amber color with a finger of white head. The nose is sticky pine sap, orange peel, with caramel ever present in the background. The first taste is pithy grapefruit, followed by a shot of resinous bitter. There is also a sweetness almost like the corn sweetness in bourbon. The finish is apple pie spice and a lingering bitter that hangs around awhile. The finish is good and dry and a bit creamy. Everything here plays so well together...no rough edges, nothing overpowers, just smooth transitions. Ahhhh..."

Not much smell through the head, but as head subsides slowly, I get good grassy fresh hop aroma.
Tastes real good, with a blossoming aftertaste revealing gentle bitter hanging on nicely and a mouth-watering need for more.
Carbonation is just right, mouthfeel rich but clear and crisp; lacing beautiful, gladness results.
Definitely a fine IPA to keep in the fridge!"
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,3.58,"Hazy and golden, huge head dies at moderate rate, sits there at low level for a hot minute. Smell is good, nice hops.

Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep and rich orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 10. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong and complex aromas of orange citrus, bread, bananas, and Belgian spices. A candied sweetness underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread notes, a sweet yeast that leaves flavors of citrus, grapes, banana, and Belgian spices of clove and coriander. A light astringency. Then a sweet and bready finish.

Feel: A heavier-body. Strong carbonation and yeast. A soft, full mouthfeel. Surprisingly clean for the sweet body. (4.25+)

Overall: A top-of-the-line Tripel here. I haven't had a good one in a while. This one reminded me what I was missing. Authentic. Nails the aromas and flavors. A nice balance of citrus, banana, and bread spice. A full, soft, yet clean mouthfeel. All aspects are top tier here. (Rating: 4.30)"

Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.27,"Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip.

Lightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention.

Sweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well.

Palate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.

Medium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.

While lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available."
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.49,"Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle.
Pouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass.
The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway.
First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation.
Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip.
the flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze."
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,3.93,"Poured from 12oz bottle

The look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.

The aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.

The flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.

Feel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.

Overall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel."
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.59,"A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should"
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.18,"Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.

Spices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.

The flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold!

Surprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.

Due to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.

Overall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style."

Popular,La Fin Du Monde,4.83,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a dark & hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs.
S - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well.
T - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise.
F - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle!
O - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle."
Popular,La Fin Du Monde,5,"Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced.

In the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed.

Palate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience

Finish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale.

While this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience.
This is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating."

Popular,Lagunitas Sucks,4.18,"The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor."
Popular,Lagunitas Sucks,3.39,"Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that."
Popular,Lagunitas Sucks,4.46,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass an off white 1F head is formed. Beer is 95% transparent and mid gold in color with tons of fine particulate. Really interesting!

On the nose I get some mild onion, pine, salt, malt grapefruit pith and rind. The aroma is intoxicating!

On the palate, WOW, orange, malt, salt water effervescence that is thirst quenching and makes me want more. It is a bit candylike and sticky thick but I want more. The malty stickiness is balanced with relatively mild hops that are grapefruit and pine. The finish is astringent and cloying but I like it because it is mellowed by the malt.

Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, cloying and tasty. Some dryness to cut the malt on the end.

I was not expecting this. I was expecting a hugely dank and super bitter beer with astringent roof peeling dryness. Not even close. Sweet candylike malt and restrained interesting hops make this a beer I will have again. A big tasty malty balanced hop bomb."

Brilliantly clear, deep gold colored body. Not much of a head upon pouring but a partial white cap covers the surface. Each sip leaves behind a tiny spot sheen of lacing. Quite the enticement to rotate the glass while drinking in order to get full glass coverage.
Aroma at a chilled temperature is hidden but bready malts and resinous hops come through.
Taste is full. Slightly sweet but well balanced with citrus, pine, and resin. The suggestion of bitterness is swirled and tempered by the floral sweetness. Leaves a buzz in the mouth, and the aftertaste continues the back and forth, with a resin high note.
Medium mouth feel. The stickiness of the resin also expresses in the mouth. Excellent carbonation.
As mentioned on the label, this is an excellent palate cleanser brew. Very expressive but without excess. Enjoyable."

Not much on the nose, a little floral, piney. Taste is spectacular. Hoppy, malty, botanicals and pine. Lightly sweet, and a nice light bitter finish. Medium high carbonation. Lighter body, but not wimpy by any means. I'll definitely grab this again the next time I'm in the mood for an IPA. I'm pretty blown away that this is 8% abv. It is so smooth and drinkable.

Popular,Ten FIDY,3.1,"Reviewed near blind... all I know whilst making these notes is it's American and high ABV%.
L- Pours jet black, with an impressive 3Cm notably very dark tan head. The head lingers for 10mins (as I was then distracted), now down to about 3mm + heavy lacing which is a heck of an achievement for this ABV% of beer where the surface-tension usually zaps the head super quickly.
S- Whiskey, treacle + timber barrel.
T- Molasses/black treacle, super deeply intense/pungent, notable whiskey, then up it comes a solid ABV% zing - bam!
F- Rich but not outright sweet. It's super-pungently flavoured, so much so it's a reeeal slow-sipping beer, just waaay too intense to sup as usual. Be aware if drinking on a hot night that the beer might materially warm in the glass before you can enjoy it all.
O- I'm often in a quandry to know how to rate beers like this. No doubt it's BIG, but subtlety and balance are harder to achieve IME and a nobler achievement, and a high ABV% CAN achieve that. It has a *very* shouty ABV%; and 12.5% isn't even that high (try visiting Iceland for properly high ABV% beer hehe) ... usually not considered good brewing if the ABV% is whacking your palate, albeit from a liquor barrel aged beer. Would I drink it again, no thanks it's way too big a shouty statement; I've had far higher ABV% beers than this that have achieved subtlety and balance.

Popular,Ten FIDY,4.2,"L - Poured from a can into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. Huge frothy two and a half finger chocolate head on aggressive pour. Lots of lacing. Dark opaque color

S - Scent was a chocolate, malt, roast, and caramel. So many great smell. Sweet. A little boozy.

T - Taste follows scent. Dark Chocolate and bitter chocolate. Roasty. Sweetness in there as well. Some dark fruits as you drink. Toward the end, the coffee notes are more present, which I don't prefer.

F - Great carbonation and frothiness. Enjoyable mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a great beer, but as with other beers with coffee flavors, I’m not a fan, since I don’t like coffee. Despite that fact, this was still a good beer for me. I’m glad I tried it, and I would definitely recommend it to any coffee fans."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.27,"Look: Jet black on the pour and in the glass and even my delicate pour prompts a huge light brown head to explode and pillow up, eventually relenting some and leaving awesome lacing behind
Aroma: Roast, dark chocolate, ethanol, roasted barley, bready notes, earthy hops, and blackstrap molasses
Taste: Brown bread, baking cocoa, and roast jump out and tailed by wafts of alcohol heat which all hold for a second before earthy and slightly spicy hops come out to play. A little molasses and light brown sugar wafts are noticed in the background and closes with roast, chocolate, and booze along with a big bite
Mouthfeel: Full, somewhat silky, medium-high carbonation, and a very dry and robust finish
Overall: I dig it. This beer is big and means business and you can tell both of those things right away. I hadn’t had this in years and it was like I remembered in that it’s a hoppy and big Imperial Stout that flexes its muscle throughout and is a well-made and good one as well. A must-try for Imperial Stout/Russian Imperial Stout fans and I’m glad that its cold outside as this one is definitely a belly warmer."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.29,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack. Canned 9/25/21, so this beer is almost 4 months old. I had this in the fridge and allowed it to come up to room temperature before I cracked it open.

Look: Pours out a very dark almost black color. There was a thick, rocky brown/dark tan colored head that slowly reduced to a thin layer, leaving behind some nice looking lacing.

Smell: Smells nice. Intense dark chocolate, coffee, sweet notes of marzipan and vanilla and some booze. There are also secondary notes of dark fruits. It has a nice roasty aroma.

Taste: Interesting. Up front, it is very dark and roasty and there are also some sweet pastry type notes (think brownies and chocolate cake). The finish lingers long and is more bitter than I expected - lots of roasted malt and there is a strong charcoal flavor on the finish. I think that there is a lot of bitterness and some oiliness from hops that is coming out in the finish. This beer definitely does not taste like it's 10.5% ABV, although I do get some warming in my chest as I consume more of it.

Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a very interesting finish. I would say that it is a bit thin for what I was hoping for.

Overall: I haven't had this beer in years. My old roommate and I used to split cases of this beer. It's definitely one of the quintessential American imperial stouts, and its availability has stood the test of time. I guess that my main criticism is that it doesn't taste as complex as some other great imperial stouts that I have had. Perhaps it would benefit from aging?"

Popular,Ten FIDY,4.43,"Scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack purchased at Super One Liquor in Duluth, MN.
An incredibly firm and deep stout. It is boozy, firm tannins, very dark with a dark tan head, roasty toasty, dark bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a lot of staying power on the palate and is staining. It's great flavors are bold and powerful overall and is quite excellent tasting. Amazing beer in a can."
Popular,Ten FIDY,3.04,"Guess I'm too stoned or something lmao, I've had a solid share of imperial stouts now and this sucks to me. I taste sweet booze and nothing else. Maybe it's somehow still cold but I'll stick to breakfast stout, KBS, Expedition, Narwhal, idk dude this is somehow one of the worst I've had."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.77,"One sip propelled this Imperial Stout into my top 3! I didn’t have to evaluate it. That’s a good sign. Seeing how dark it was, I expected it to be thick-n-chewy, sweet, and have a lot of alcohol burn.
Holy shit!…It had more balance than an olympic gymnast and an exceptional roasted malt complexity which carried throughout the finish. I avoid canned beer at all costs, but I really wanted to try this one so I took a chance on it. Poured into a stout glass and cooled just long enough, I indulged. I expected the typical regret of a curiosity purchase, but instead I was thrilled at the discovery of a new favorite! Although I was amused by the name of this beer, it actually detracts from this seriously well crafted Imperial Stout."

Popular,Ten FIDY,4.49,"1800th review!

Appearance - Pours a dark jet black with two fingers of frothy mocha tan head.

Smell - earthy, leafy, and floral hops, coffee bean, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin and fig), cocoa, and earthy yeast.

Taste - earthy, leafy, and floral hops upfront. Then quickly goes into the bold coffee bean, cocoa, roasted malts, and dark fruits (raisin and fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes velvety smooth with the bold coffee bean and cocoa with a nice lingering alcohol warmth.

Overall - A stellar imperial stout that has been on my radar for quite some time. If you come across this don't leave your local liquor store without a can or two. A pleasant sipper."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.47,"This shouldn't take more than a twelve ounce can poured out and into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. It's expresso black-brown with a tidy tan head that is lasting. There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes. The ABV is high and somewhat noticeable, so that may also put off some. Overall, this is an obviously great example of brewing craftsmanship. But when you go this boldly, not all will follow."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.7,"Pours opaque jet black with a thin but persistent tan rim.

Heady nose of malt, molasses, pumpernickel and black figs.

Palate is massive. First taste is a big bitter hit.beer swiftly envoloped by roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, with fruity fig and plum notes. Some sweetness but the bitterness lingers right through the long finish.

Very full bodied with minimal carbonation, unctuous mouthfeel, lovely lingering bitterness, lot of warm alchohol. Beautiful savoury beer.

This beer ages really well. Mellows some of the alchohol heat and the flavor marry wonderfully."
Popular,Ten FIDY,4.71,"It smells sweet with malts and a lot of bourbon. That's really all that I'm getting.

The taste is like bready bourbon up front and then you get a rich coffee bitterness.  The stout coffee flavor and the sweet woody bourbon complement each other beautifully and provide for a balanced taste.

This beer is full bodied and smooth with just a subtle carbonation that gives it an even thicker feel. The finish is clean with alcohol and coffee.

Overall this one is pretty damn fantastic. So balanced and the mouthfeel is great. I'm giving it a 5.8 out of 6... so good!"
Popular,Abt 12,5,This beer still blows my mind. It's wholesome and delicious and everyone that I've showed it to ended up loving it as much as me. It's better than Chimay and Duvel which are also great Belgian ales. I imagine that Belgium saves it's best brews for themselves and send us the bottom of the barrel of their good beers so to say which I'm not complaining about.

Feel: Full mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation.

Overall: Prime example of the style. Very complex. Not too alcoholic despite its high ABV. Should be drank at the recommended temperature since it unfolds its full potential as it warms. Fantastic beer."
Popular,Abt 12,4.32,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a deep mahogany/brown color with about three fingers worth of fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of chunky lacing.

Aroma pleasant, but a bit less robust than I expected. Bready with notes of raisins, plums, dates and a faint yeastiness that rounds out the beer.

Taste follows the nose closely, dark/brown bread, dark fruits, a mild spiciness, and a mild banana-esque yeast flavor. Medium bodied, slick on the tongue, and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is quite a pleasant beer that I look forward to revisiting."
Popular,Abt 12,4.57,Yah this one’s legit. Was happy to find at Rock&Brews Orlando. Smooth and trippel notes but so much more. Lovely feel. Very balanced without being too malty or too hoppy.
Popular,Abt 12,4.24,"Poured from a 75cL corked bottle into the biggest glass I have, a spieglau American wheat beer glass and It barely fit. A dark murky brown red letting almost no light through. On the pour I got a 2 finger head that started overflowing. After a little while it disappeared to nothing. Not all that carbonated looking.

Smell is very yeast forward with fruit notes and some malts coming through. Very similar to a dry wine with grainy notes very heavy smell. Some alcohol.

Flavor is quite similar to the nose but malts are much more present. Still some acidity and fruit notes mixing with the roast to make it a bit winey. Very dark and fruity beer at the same time. Some alcohol is detected but it seems to compliment the beer at warmer Temps (20 minutes out the fridge). Very nuanced beer.

Feel is a bit thinner than I would've expected. I thought it would be thicker from all the grain that went into it. But its still very nice and almost easy to put down if it wasn't so extremely flavorful.

Overall, its a very interesting beer with lots of flavors to explore. This beer is pretty extreme to the point of giving me winey vibes, but still at its core it is beer. This is my first experience with a real belgian ale other than an old bottle of duvel a long time ago so I don't know all that much about the style. However I enjoyed this beer"
Popular,Abt 12,4.18,"Some fluffy, beaten egg white foam forms over a deep copper, almost brown body. There's some sediment floating about, but not as much as anticipated considering I can't remember how long ago I purchased this bottle. Been meaning to pop the cork for awhile now. Smells super bready and yeasty, but not in the way you generally find typical of Belgians. This is its own thing, at least to my nostrils. Lots of sweet, dark fruit; figs and such. Also some fruity notes you wouldn't necessarily expect with raspberries standing out to me. Smells fookin' great. Tastes it as well. Not as good as implied by the nose, but very tasty all the same. Yeasty up front with a fruity middle and a bready finish. Nowhere near as boozy as I'd assumed with something of this octane. Low carbonation suits this beer very well. Complex yet easy drinking beer = big thumbs up from me."
Popular,Abt 12,4.68,"L - Poured from. 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 60 degrees. One finger tan frothy head. Dark opaque brown color. Frothy lacing just stays on the glass walls

S - dark fruits like cherry, raisins, etc. and sweet bread malt scents.

T - taste follows scent with sweet bread and dark fruits. Some alcohol comes through at 10% ABV, but it’s more balanced and easy to drink than you would expect. The lightest of a floral hop bitterness in the taste. A little smoky/toasty cola comes through on some tastes as it warms up. Agitating it half way through brings back the sweet flavors. The complexity is great.

F - frothy and great thick mouthfeel. Solid carbonation.

O - This is a great beer. Obviously at 10% ABV this is a one drink and done. But the scent and flavors are excellent. Nice complexity with each taste and smell. I really enjoyed the fact that agitating/swirling partway through brought back the initial flavor and scent profiles. All in all, even at the higher ABV, I drank this one pretty fast as I kept going back for different tastes. Highly recommended as I add this to my annual rotation."
Popular,Abt 12,4.33,"Pours a deep ruby, two inch off tan head that fades after two minutes

Rum soaked deserts, malt, bread, raisin on the nose.

The look is strong, aromas fairly decent, but the drink is where the beer is, as described, formidable. Tastes of sugared bread, dried fruits such as raisins and even dried candied melon and cherry. Powerful malt backbone that lasts for days

General alcohol warmth to the sip. Assertive mouthfeel with good carbonation. My beer hid the bitterness quite well, with the sweet malt notes winning every time. Might be due to this bottle being a little older (likely).

As it warms the beer opens up quite a bit. The malty, bready notes are even more prominent if that’s even possible. Once again that rum raisin alcohol warmness presents itself. What is harder to describe is the melding of multiple flavours and tastes that’s hard for me to pick out. I’d love to come back to this beer eventually.

Complex, and even more so as it warms. One of those beers that deserves a revisit every year. I wish I could give this a better review; I chose this beer as its strong as we just receive news Russia has invaded Ukraine. A beer, a moment in time, I don’t think I’ll ever forget and will likely become a home for me and my memories in the future."
Popular,Abt 12,4.53,"Beautiful look and scent to this classic. Big tan head, wonderful lacing.

Taste of biscuits and prunes. Quite sweet, although that tapers as it warms. Heavy, with some alcohol warming. Big mouthfeel, malt that lingers for days. Excellent balance for such robust flavors.

Formidable brew"
Popular,Abt 12,4.13,"Overall: a triumphant beer that definitely stands out when you want a heavy beer but not a stout. It reminds me of old/stock ales but with less hops and bitterness. Tastes of raisin, rum, bread, and a slight pucker from prunes.

Great right ahead or right after the coldes of months, or when you need something to sip all night and a stout would be too much.

I do think there may be better quads, but as of yet I haven't found one that tops Abt 12.

Look: a dark mahogany brown that looks almost deep purple if not under light. Beautiful lacing with the a thick head that dissipates into a nice creamy top coating of bubbles.

Smell:right up in your nose, this one carries a pervasive aroma though it's not heavy. I catch the smell of Belgian yeast (sharp/sour) and it's lovely.

Taste: don't tackle this one when it's too cold, I enjoyed it after 40+ mins out of the fridge. Bold flavors that are balanced between raisins, prunes, rum, and dark bread. Loved that I can't taste any rock sugar, a common issue with me and high ABV Belgian beers.

Feel: top of the mouth silkiness and a long lasting presence on the top of the mouth/cheeks."

Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.38,"Pours a nice reddish-brown colour with and amber head and slight lacing.

Smells of dark fruit, spice, caramel, and an alcoholic rye-like note.

Taste follows the nose. Intense flavour of aged dark fruit up front with a lot of spice and apricot. Sweet notes in the background of caramel and bready malt. The spicy alcohol profile is very similar to what you get on a high abv rye barrel aged ale. It's pretty intense but it fits the style and flavour profile really well.

The mouthfeel is full bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. Kind of acidic, very smooth.

This beer is awesome overall but it's pretty far off of my favourite abbey quads. I won't get this again for a while, but I don't regret buying it, even though I paid $10 for it. Very complex beer with a ton of intense flavours that embody its style very well."

Unbelievable! I can't do justice to this with my description!"
Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.64,"Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.

Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.

As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.

Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour.

It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it."
Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.88,"I've had a few really good Belgian ales before, but this one is very close to being my favorite.
Received via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.
Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.
Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon.
The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!
The feel, well, excellent. Almost, but not quite, viscous. I still opted to drink this slowly and savor it, for it is worth savoring.

Popular,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.68,"Brief review from when I had this at a restaurant

Big frothy head that quickly dissipates, it has a very lovely, crystal clear amber colour.

Noble hops present in the body of the beer, pleasant bitterness backed by a predominantly caramel malt backbone. Very crisp, light-medium bodied. Loved the bitter ring on the finish, with the malty vanilla grain notes gently riding out as well.

One of the best macro offerings for sure. Had a lot of craft that was even as good as this."
Popular,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.96,"Beautiful medium amber color with thin off-white head. The smell is average, with a hint of malt. The first sip is malty and bready, that turns into toffee. I am a big fan of carbonation and wouldn’t mind a little more in this brew- but it is an adequate amount which allows you to experience the transition of flavors. I typically don’t notice this much flavor movement in macro beers, but this one is prevalent and welcomed. The finish is semi-dry with nearly no bitterness. It is like drinking a full bodied beer without the full bodied fullness. I had one once before, but I was already pretty drunk and didn’t appreciate it for what it is. It’s no Coors Banquet, but it definitely is worth revisiting if you haven’t become a total beer snob! (Haha) …and who doesn’t love their commercials?! I give this a solid 4 in my humble opinion and I would not turn this down if offered. When it comes to complexity of taste- this is truly the King of the macros."

One and a quarter finger off-white head on an aggressive pour that fades down to a bubble film that stays throughout the drink. Medium amber brown color. Clear with no haziness.

T - Caramel Malts are front and center. Light toastiness on the back end. Some sweetness in there. Minimal hop flavors with almost no bitterness.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some frothiness. Medium carbonation.

O - Overall, this is a solid malt-forward beer. Sam Adams Boston Lager has been a standard beer for me for many years. It’s one of the better all-around beers for someone who is not a hop-head. Great smooth malt flavors. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to all."
Popular,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.77,"Look - color is somewhat copper and pretty clear. Head was about 1 finger size and dissipated quickly.

Smell - A little malty with hints of toffee and vanilla.

Taste - The taste surprised me because the hops are more present than I expected based on the smell. It was a nice surprise and gave good depth to the beer.

Feel - Good, standard lager with moderate carbonation.

Overall--a good, but not fancy beer. It seems like a pretty safe choice and should appeal to a lot of people, but doesn't have the complexity of so many of the craft beers out there. Still, probably my favorite macro lager that is available most places."

Overall this in my opinion is a different brew than 35 years ago when they were trying to make a name for themselves. This was my go to beer and if I moved to another State that did not stock it , I would tell the owners how fantastic this beer was. ( I may as well have worked for them) it was the best beer, (also Anchor Steam) at the time in the US market- This seems like a cheapened version on every level of ingredients. It was a beer I would have rated a 4.5. This on the other hand shows what mass production can do to quality of ingredients. Last time I drank this ,SAM Adams was trying to impress, now they are a small conglomerate who makes mediocre beer. Sad that success destroys the product-"

Had a dry feel to it with some bitterness at the sides of your mouth. You can definitely taste the hops, leaving it more honestly bitter than I expected and some spice notes with that. The IBU rating will deceive you. It taste like an inoffensive beer with a strong hop flavor. Was excited to try this and it disappointed. Not bad."
Popular,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.66,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (beers for cheers)
The look is a nice solid to light amber with average carbonation. Head on the pour isnt spectacular, but what does form sticks around for a while. Crystal clear

Hops are very present on the nose, but almost all bittering hops. Very classic hop scent blending very well into the malt backbone. Very pleasant scent. Herbal earthy and malty.

Taste almost resembles a pale ale. Hops largely overpower any lager characteristic, much unlike their winter lager. Still easy to put down and inoffensive but much more bitter than most lagers I've had despite the claim of 30 IBU on the bottle. Wish the malt was stronger on the taste. It does come through in the after taste though.

Feel is like most lagers easy to put down not too heavy and pretty refreshing the strong hops detract from refreshing as much but that's not a huge deal it came in a winter pack.

Overall a pretty good hoppy lager. Choppier than a traditional pils, but nothing crazy. Flavors are all ones you've had before, but maybe not in a lager. Pretty good definitely better than most macros flavor wise but maybe not refreshing wise."
Popular,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.77,"Dark copper colored with a quarter inch of beige head on top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark, bready malt and a touch of grassy hops. I’m tasting caramel and marzipan with a touch of grassy hops in the fade. The mouth is crisp and refreshing."

Overall...A solid but not exceptional beer to me. Living in New England for many years, beers here tasted like this 20 years ago. With the age of the beers unknown maybe this would be better another time? It's Aiiiiight"
Popular,IPA,3.96,"A turbid amber beer with a long-lasting foamy head. A bread grassy peppery aroma that doesn't overwhelm nor stimulate the senses. A slight malty taste with little to no aftertaste, light, but not watery flavor. A pretty good IPA without anything to disappoint or overwhelm. An easy-drinking beer."
Popular,IPA,3.78,"Picked up a 12 oz single as part of a mixed sixer from the Ingles cooler on Spartanburg Highway 1-20-22 for $1.83. canned 9-2-21; consumed 4-25-22. Cold stored since purchase.

Beer poured golden orange with a very nice white head.

Nose is floral hops forward with a touch of grapefruit.

Taste follows the nose with a lighter pale malt base that has some grapefruit flavored hops and finishes pretty bitter with a nice piney bite; 8/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth and refreshing.

Overall a pretty good IPA that i would have again."

F: Smooth mouthful, medium body.

O: This is a nice old school IPA."
Popular,IPA,4.09,"12oz can EB date 4/29/22 into a 16oz pint glass.
L: Pours a light sediment-hazed thick light amber gold w/a 2"" off-white rocky head with decent retention. Med-low carbonation and light sticky lacing. It's look reminds me of Firestone/Walker IPAs with fine sediment in suspension.
S: Citrus fruits, gently spicy hops, orange, mango, a hint of banana.
T: Citrus, pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, caramelized malts, a hint of bread. Bitterness lingers and hops are slightly resinous and stay centralized on the tongue.
F: Med-bodied slick & juicy mouthfeel with a med-length finish that is gently drying and lingering.
O: Good bitterness and balance and is fairly easy drinking even at at cellar temps. A straight up no-frills American IPA that is very good in it's style."
Popular,IPA,3.98,"Attractive clear amber appearance.
Around a medium body with carbonation that seems a little bit too much but still a pleasant feel.
Aroma is grapefruit, citrus, malt,floral earthy.
Taste is mildly sweet with a nice hop bite that doesn't dominate and take over.
Im not a big fan of ipas but this seemed to have enough of a malt taste to create a really nice beer."
Popular,IPA,3.42,"This particular beer is described as a ""go-to brew"". It pours a light amber with a white head. The nose is full of malt and hops and the taste is the same. My chief complaint is the mouthfeel is thin for an IPA. If you were planning a session or wanted something quick and easy I suppose this could work, but I'd have liked a little more body. Otherwise it's a fine beer."
Popular,IPA,4.13,"Clear, dark amber body; excellent carbonation; thick, sculpted head, white and sticky; lacing weaves along the glass. Nice dank, pine-like aroma with a bit of citrus. Nicely balanced taste; unobtrusive malt backbone supporting a moderate, zesty hop bitterness; pine resin; light esters. Medium body; crisp and slightly prickly on the palate; semi-dry mouthfeel throughout.

Appearance: Clear gold, particles in suspension, big head.

Smell: Nice pink grapefruit aroma, some sweetness.

Taste: Mild sweetness followed by moderate citrus bitterness. Clean feel, dry finish, easy drinking.

Overall: Kind of an old school IPA here as beer #2 from the Sweetwater mix pack. I like it a lot, hits the right balance between sweetness and bitterness and is an easy drinker."
Popular,IPA,4.02,"Very smooth and bland but generally good flavors - sort of citrusy. No bitterness, soft feel, no real aroma to it oddly enough, not much head either. Reminds me of sam adams hazy IPA"

This is a very good IPA."
Popular,IPA,4.28,"Dated can is best by 4 months away. Rich, medium honey gold body, a nice thick 2-3 finger head, which slowly thins down a little by halfway and leaves good lacing . Appearance-wise, it's practically perfect.

Smells excellent, but words escape me for this. Very fresh and hoppy with some malt undertone. One that I love to schnoff on for a few good minutes of whiffage. Fruity , vegetal and dank and great!

Taste is excellent, with a bright overall hoppy vibe and enough malt notes to have some balls. Versatile and smashable, while still being crafted with enough dank hops to satisfy as a sipper. Quality brew, obviously.

Feel is just right for the balance of malt and hops. Really right.

Overall, it's one of my go to standard IPA's for the reasons above, and the Sweetwater mix pack 12ers are killer. Hell yes!"
Popular,IPA,3.91,"355 ml bottle, from the Norwegian importer. ABV is 6.3%. Deep golden colour, moderate white head. Pleasant aroma of citrus / oranges, also notes of flowers and spruce. Slightly dry flavour, grapefruity and resinous hops with a bitter finish, sufficient malts."

Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.79,"This is a 120z. can given an aggressive pour into the 20oz. weizen glass. The ale has an orange tint with a thick three finger head. It has settled a little leaving some thick lacing behind. The carbonation is plentiful, offering a pleasant show in this beer.
The aroma is a tart citrus, noticeable instantly upon opening the can. There is a subtle wheat fragrance also.
The taste offers tart citrus with a navel sweetness. The finish is crisp, somewhat bitter, with plenty of sweetness also.
There is something rather smooth feeling here, but the hops hide that a little with the bitterness.
This is a refreshing, complex ale, true to Lagunitas review. For me it was very enjoyable to sample this IPA."

Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.78,"I had this one a long while back but finally trying again after experiencing a great (too?) many IPAs..

Very clear gold with a thin head... very subdued carbonation. Subdued aroma too but get some pine, grapefruit, banana?

I sipped with some hesitation because i remember this one biting me many years before (and i have a mildly difficult time with wheat beers). There is the undeniable ""Lagunitas backbone"" that i detect in all of their beers -- not sure if it's the malt, the water, or what. But it is interesting - the wheat beer side definitely melds well with the IPA side and makes this quite drinkable. I just find it rather unremarkable. Good beer - but it's a one and done for me and I won't go out of my way to find it."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.29,"Been wanting to try this one for a long time, finally broke down and bought some. Poured from can into pint glass a bright gold tone with medium white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is so so, medium citrus note. Taste is balanced with a toasted wheat sense. Feels very smooth with a nice weight in the mouth. Finishes nice and dry. I appreciate most brews from Lagunitas, and I agree that this is some of their best."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.01,I think Lagunitas describes it best: Way smooth and silky with a nice wheatly-esque-ish-ness. A truly unique style featuring a strong hop finish on a silky body. A hoppy pale wheat ale that is great for IPA fans but so smooth that the hefeweizen fans dig it too.
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.23,Poured a golden honey looking color with a white head. The smell was of tropical fruits and hops. The taste was pretty smooth with a hint of lemon and/or lime. A very good tasting beer that I've been happy to finally get.
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.81,"L: A deep golden yellow with 1/2 inch white lace.
S: Hint of citrus
T: Well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the underlying the experience.
F: think with a nice bite at the end.
O: smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.56,"I'm not a hoppy guy, but this I can actually drink on occasion. Piney but not as obnoxious (to me) as most, and with a bit of grapefruit flavor, it takes two things I don't like and seemingly cancels them out.Thicker than you expect, and oddly refreshing."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.58,Tastes somewhere between a hazy IPA and a west coast IPA. Like the sweetness of the wheat but I feel like it's missing something. Ended up feeling torn on this one and ended up feeling a bit indifferent. Probably need to go through another six pack to form strong opinion. Would recommend if you like hazy's but want something more bitter than your traditional sweeter hazy.
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.12,"Pours slightly cloudy with one-inch head. Smell oranges, biscuit. Taste is the same; the beer is a bit sweet but satisfying. At $9.99 a six-pack it is great value for a good beer."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.42,"L: A bit darker yellow but all the fizz and bubbles of an average beer. Little head and lace. A bit cloudy.
S: Orange and Grapefruit. Not strong.
M: Chewy and thick with quite a bit of bitter at the side and remainder.
T: Out of the park? If this is a ""wheat based"" IPA, I'm now a fan? I was impressed by how much balance yet how bitter this was. The primary fruitiness flavor doesn't have the ""Juicy Fruit"" of lots of the other similar beers. Like the scent, it is well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the overall experience.
O: It's a great IPA that maybe might be too bitter for some, yet, smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters."

Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.77,"Nice golden color with a nice white head.

Nice smell, a mix of pines, hops. Taste is very rich, according to the smell pines, hops, citrics.

A nice rounded beer, will have more of it. Recomended"
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.24,"Look: Nearly clear orange in color with a frothy white head that builds and holds as a lid, slowly receding and leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Pine, oranges, sweetened strawberries, ruby-red grapefruit, wafts of blueberries, sweet bready malt, and gooseberries
Taste: A huge mixed berry blend comes together and starts it off, soon followed by a sweet orange-led citrus hit. Pine and fresh baked bread weave in and out of the picture throughout and closes with berries, malt sweetness, and a light bite
Mouthfeel: Full, quite smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish
Overall: I dig it. This is, and has been for years, my favorite of these folks’ offerings and unlike in my past, probably one of the only ones I still buy on occasion. When this beer is fresh, like this one is, it’s a winner with lots of nice hop flavor/aroma and the wheat malt component gives it a silky mouthfeel that rounds it out and keeps it from being sharp at all. A tasty hoppy pale wheat ale and one of the best, IMO"
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.9,"Another classic. Actually quite enjoyable. I went to college in Boulder and don’t fully understand why this became so popular everywhere, but it it helped usher in the craft revolution and is a whole lot better than bud light."
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,4.13,poured from a 12oz bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a light amber with a finger of off-white foam head. toasted malts on the nose with the taste following. it’s got decent mouthfeel. a little bland but it’s readily available and it’s no terrible.
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.87,"Nice amber color, fairly clear and pulls a alright head, not amazing but its something. Smells alright, nice hit of toasted malt, caramel and floral/citrusy hops. A tad bit of the yeast comes through on the nose. Taste is pretty good. Its very crisp and refreshing. The toasty malt hits you first, then you the hops, but not alot of bitterness. The finish is good, crisp and you dont get any alcohol. Overall great mainstream beer."
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.53,"This review is mostly from memory from last night, couldn’t review it properly but not a big deal as this beer is pretty much just a straightforward, inoffensive amber.

No appreciable head on the pour but it is a gorgeous crystal clear, darker orange-amber colour. Genuinely amber. Very nice. Aromas of grassy but most flora hops, lightly toasty caramel malts. And the taste is identical on the palate. Not much else to say. I didn’t notice any ashy or burnt qualities personally, which for my palate might’ve actually been a nice spin (though burnt malt notes get you a little out of amber territory)

Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly prickly on the tongue, very crisp

It’s an average amber, better than any macro, underwhelming by modern craft beer drinker standards"
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.52,"Pours spot-on amber. Amber amber. Tiny bit hazy. The head recedes quickly and leaves spotty lacing for whatever that's worth. Smells quite decent, orchard fruit, maybe apple, not too far off what you'd expect from a British amber ale. There's also a very subtle toasty aroma. Unfortunately it smells better than it tastes. The flavours are understated. More of that orchard fruit, but unfortunately none of that quintessentially British marmalade flavour. There is some gently bittering hops to balance it out. There is also a strange ashy flavour. Other reviewers described this beer as very biscuity, but I don't find that. It tastes somehow slightly burt and, well, ashy. That is subtle but not very pleasant, and the more you focus on it the more it irks. The mouthfeel is all right, no complaints. Overall it's not a bad beer but I'd only consider it one or two steps up from the average American macro swill. At least this has a bit of character."
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.52,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by April 10th yikes a little old but I'll adjust scores.

On the pour a white 2 finger head forms that quickly recedes back down to a 2mm head. Color is about as spot onto amber as you can get and there's a decently lively carbonation. No haze. Light lacing.

Smell is a bit old, but beyond the light skunkiness it reminds me of what I can only describe as belgian light beer. All I can really detect is the old hops and yeast not a lot of malt character here.

Taste is quite similar to the nose. There is some sweetness coming from the malt but it is mostly covered by the yeast character which is quite bright and belgian tasting, but not as strong as traditional belgian beer. Some malt aftertaste as would be expected from an amber. Not a bad flavor but slightly boring.

Feel is a bit light for the style. Definitely can see that it was competing with macros back in the day it's slightly heavier than a lager but it clears the palate fast and has a slight drying effect.

Overall this beer is better than I remember it but the flavors are quite subtle. Apart from the aged hops there's nothing off or offensive about this and it's very easy to drink but only a step or two up from traditional American macros. In Colorado this almost feels like a local macro. I wouldn't seek it out but I'd choose it over a few beers for sure"
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,4,"Look: Nearly clear reddish amber with a creamy looking head that retains well and eventually settles, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked bread, light toffee notes, wafts of dough, caramel, lightly toasted grains, and some malt sweetness
Taste: Caramel-dipped bread and tons of it starts things off as some doughy notes and toffee filter in behind. These components continue to develop and deepen along with some toasted grains and closes how it started
Mouthfeel: Full, pretty smooth, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and smooth finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic in its own right and a tasty and well-made Amber ale to boot. Probably not too exciting for some but it’s a great no-nonsense, easy-drinking, malty beer that is nice to have readily available pretty much anywhere and inexpensive to enjoy"
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.97,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at roughly 50 - 55 degrees. One and a half finger light tan head on an aggressive pour. Clear amber-brown color. Some lacing that fades.

S - Sweet malt up front. Creamy/buttery scent. Some light bread as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet buttery caramel malts. Light Biscuit. No bitterness, all straightforward flavor. A bit of toastiness as it warms up.

F - Good buttery medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation.

O - This is a good straightforward beer. The flavors are a basic caramel/biscuit malt, and there is no bitterness. This is a very pleasing beer that I would always choose ahead of the American mass market beers. In fact, I would classify this as one of my standard beers. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to everyone."
Popular,Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.72,"Color is a dark amber that is translucent. Pour was nice with a small head that dissipated really quickly, leaving little bits of disconnected lace on the glass. I noticed the aroma instantly while pouring with the phenolic aroma characteristic of a Belgian style ale. Taste is very crisp, and notably well balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and yeasty flavors. For a bBelgian style ale, it is somewhat muted, but in a way I think works very well for an easily drinkable rendition of this style. Overall, a very solid beer, I think the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because the style in general is not one of my favorites."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,2.04,"World's oldest brewery? Really? I'm sure I have had the world's oldest brewery beer before, and it wasn't this...

I used to love weissbier when I was about 20...but recently I haven't really liked it so much, anyway let's give this a go. I used to have an Erdinger glass at home.

Very typical bananaey aroma...heavy...sweet like a desert...not really inviting to me. Very smooth head and deep orange colour, looks great in the glass.

Taste is unique for sure. Very different to other weissbiers I have tried, such as Erdinger (my favourite beer around 20 years old). This is much lighter and ever so smooth. And not as sweet as the aroma makes you believe...but for me it's a bit too smooth, and a bit too unexciting...there is no complex mouth feel or bitter hop aftertaste of a Radeberger, West Coast IPA or Belgian tripel. Or the mystical smoothness of a Chimay Bleu. This is kind of simple, pleasant...and easy to like. I'm definitely not a fan of wheat beer, though I kind of understand why people would like this, though...in the same way people like ice cream. It's just not for me."

Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.89,From bottle at a pub in Germany. Lives up to the high rating. Looks perfect. Smells absolutely amazing. And the taste follows. Smooth as butter. Banana is the keyword here. Banana in both smell and taste. But not overpowering. Simply amazing!
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.46,"Beer poured from tap.

The body pours an orange gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention and lacing. A handsome beer especially in the right glassware.

Nose is the banana-bubble gum aroma for which the style is famous. Hit-or-miss for some folks, but a big hit for me. Add the familiar clove and I was a happy guy.

Taste substantially follows nose with the clove stepping up a bit. A bit sweet but a modest hop flavor is present helping balance the beer.

Good carbonation and mouthfeel make it an easy drinker."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.29,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: 6301
Consumed on: 2022-july-26
Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp:


Look:
Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass when I hold it up to a light. 3-finger pillowy and creamy off-white head slowly dissolves to a 1-finger consistent and creamy cover. When I opened the beer, it slowly started pushing up out of its bottle. Some yeast looks to have remained on the bottom of the bottle, indicating that this sample will not be as opaque as 'normal'.

Smell:
All kinds of banana along with some sweet fruit that has been lightly sugared. Balancing this is a nice clove note. Wonderful nose.

Taste:
Similar to the nose but with the addition of wheat notes that come across as very slightly bready or perhaps doughy. There is also a mineral note. Everything is very nicely balanced. The finish is lightly sweet and clovey.

Feel:
Smooth, soft, and creamy. The body is not quite medium.

Overall:
A great Hefeweizen from a top-notch brewery. Quaffable, balanced, and refreshing. This is the benchmark for the style and has been so for decades. One of my favorite Hefeweizens, along with those from Andechs, Ayinger, and Schneider."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.94,"Truly amazing beer. Definitely a must try and must have on hand beer. One in my regular rotation. It seems that cans are fresher than bottles where I am in the U.S.

Banana, caramel & mild clove notes in the nose.

Creamy, medium mouthfeel.

Banana & mild caramel flavors up front; mild clove notes on the finish.

An exemplary take on the style; I'd have another! And another!"
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,3.88,"Had 16oz on tap at RiNo Beer Garden

On the pour a 1.5 finger fine head just over the glass that slowly receded and became rocky and creamy looking. Color is a dark gold with standard hefe haze. Carbonation is light enough that it's hard to see through the haze. Some lacing forms if you drink it fast enough but not the best lacing ever.

Aroma is full of banana esters and a bit of acetaldehyde but not anymore than is expected of the style. Aroma is relatively light and not a lot of the malts come through this is all yeast on the nose.

Flavor is similar to the aroma with a certain lightness to it followed by a nice hit of traditional hefe flavors, once again a little tarter than I'd prefer, but nothing overwhelming or out of character for the style. There is a definite minerality to the flavorfollowed by some light bitterness and grassiness from a light dose of noble hops. Followed up by all that a sweet wheat maltiness does creep in making for a nice finish with a bit of sweetness after yeasty slightly bitter flavors.

The feel is once again a bit light and astringent, but the head retention on this makes for a relatively balanced light feeling making it not watery. The finish is relatively long for how light it is and in the chest you can feel the alcohol warming sensation a little bit.

Overall this is a good example of a traditional hefeweisen and a bit drier than the hofbrau hefe but without the citrus notes of an americanized hefe or traditional American wheat."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,"LOOK: Golden orange/yellow, semi-hazy, two fingers of very fine foam.
SMELL: little bit of clove and hops, lots of banana.
TASTE: exactly like it smells in a snifter. Directly from the bottle, it’s 100% banana.
FEEL: very smooth and refreshing with medium body and medium-light carbonation.
OVERALL: This is, to me, a perfect beer. It’s insane. It’s refreshing with just enough body to it to be rewarding without feeling bloated afterwards. The tastes are lovely and perfectly balanced, and there’s a variation in flavors between the glass and the bottle that are both wonderful in their own way. The best part about it is that it’s not even expensive, either. It’s like $11 for a 6pk at my local liquor store. That’s only $2 more than a 6pk of Heineken for THIS."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.59,"Poured golden amber, not transparent but not cloudy either. Unfiltered?
The head was nearly white and fleeting but that may be due to the age of the beer.
The aroma was mostly cloves and, oddly, banana. At least the impression of banana.
The taste, wow. Cloves are prominent but not overwhelming, banana is more an essence than flavor, and the malts are balanced, tasty and rewarding. So good, I think I need more of this one for the summer.
The feel was smooth as the carbonation was slow and sparse, but present. Didn’t detract from the experience at all.
Not sure why I waited so long to try this, it’s really good!"
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,"Wow. Poured at ~43 degrees F into a pint glass. Cloudy golden nectar with very fine bubbles in the finger of head that reduces to a film and a ring around the glass. If there was a banana Wheaties, this could be the mascot. Smell is, of course, banana, clove, nutmeg, as is taste, but more importantly, this beer does not include any of the previously stated foods as actual ingredients. This beer is brewed under the Purity Law of 1516, meaning it uses only malt, hops, water, and yeast. This philosophy of brewing has led to a masterpiece that lingers on the palette like you've just had a bowl of Cream of Wheat. Mouth feel is velvety creaminess; CO2 level perfectly present and fulfilling. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Very smooth going down with a a slightly less than medium mouthfeel. Super easy drinker even on a hot Texas day. Easily the best wheat brew I've ever tried."

Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.62,"Poured from 330 ml bottle into pint glass. Thick pillowy white head, mild lacing, hazy golden orange color. Aroma of banana, spices, yeast rolls. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Flavors of clove, cinnamon, banana, bread, herbal hops. Overall: excellent in the style."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.17,"Poured from a 500mL glass bottle to my Weihenstephaner hefe glass, just about a finger and a half of dense foamy, uneven head appears. Cloudy orange with a tinge of yellow.

Strong bubblegum aroma hits me first, followed by banana. Gentle spices, of which clove is the most noticeable. Wheaty and gentle yeast ester smell, maybe the palest or grassy funk.

Of all the hefe’s, I have always found Weihenstephaner to be strongest on the bubblegum and banana, which it does not disappoint on the palate here. Of the sweet malt it is crackery like wheat dominated, rather than the doughy malt of Belgians. Great cereal grain taste on the finish. Cloves and mild white peppery like spices wane in and out. A bit of mint was apparent as well.

Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation of the effervescent kind, tight small bubbles create a mild prickliness on the top of your tongue and a semi foamy sip. A gentle finish, not dry nor wet, which leaves an essence of banana bread and grains on the tongue.

Two things here: firstly, I don’t think my bottle was the freshest. I am going to revisit this review down the line and do a side by side comparison. Secondly, Weihenstephaner is and always will be the first beer that got me into drinking good beer, foreign beer, and craft. Once I had it, I never looked back. It was not my gold standard for Hefeweizens, but beer in general. As stated, I have my own Weihenstephaner glass I drink all my wheat beers out of.

That said… I think in the years that have passed, I can’t really rank it as a 98 like it is on BA. It’s legendary with a strong backing, but in modern times I’ve had too many wheat beers that were so complex and just as good, I think the beer coasts just a little off of its legendary reputation. Keeping in mind, I do believe the beer is the standard bearer/gold standard of the style. It’s the absolute most classic, straight up example of the excellency of wheat beers. For most of its existence it might as well have been Zeus compared to all other beers. In modern times, however, many others have climbed Mt Olympus and taken their place beside it. I say all this despite unending nostalgia for the beer and being it’s biggest lover for well over a decade and a half. This is still a phenomenal beer, best of the old guard. I look forward to revisiting the review with the freshest bottle I can find!"

Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.25,"To my sophisticated palate, this IPA, out of all of them, plays the balance between ""east coast"" and ""west coast"" styles perfectly. It's got that citrus, tropical juiciness of the east yet all of the piney, resinous character of the left coast. I especially enjoy it in the 19.2 oz taller boy can."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.4,"Available almost everywhere in the US, this take on a classic American IPA is just Great. Pair it up with whatever you’re doing, whatever you’re eating. Dress it up or slosh it down.
Balanced, little bitta, hoppy, good head retention, it’s a happy IPA that’s priced right.
We have a Winner, Folks!"
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.61,"As most have stated, this is the standard for juicy IPAs. They just hit the nail on the head with the balance of juice, pine, bite. Beautiful golden copper color. Strong but not overwhelming ABV. One of my top 4 IPAs (Space Dust, Scofflaw Basement, Wicked Weed Freak of Nature)."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.92,"When poured from tap. A 1/4 inch head.
Amber color Slight hop aroma.
Smooth over the taste buds with a slight hop after taste.
A very good summer beer !!"
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.62,"I have nothing to add to the hundreds of other glowing reviews already posted. This is a consistently excellent IPA, and furthermore it's always one of the least expensive in any beer store cooler. Well done on all counts. A solid ""A""."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.12,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours orange red with a fluffy slightly off white head. Smells of citrus and piney hops. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, nice and full. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.4,"Jai Alai is one of my go to beers. It's easy to find down here in Florida & I really appreciate that. Wonderful tropical smell.
Taste is citrus, orange, nice hop kick, pine spice and sweet caramel malt to balance it out. Great brew!"
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.22,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Slightly hazy pale amber color with a foamy white head that receded to a thin film but left some rings of lace. Strong citrus and hop resin aroma. Taste follows, a citrus smorgasbord with some smooth malt to round it out in a very flavorful but not overwhelming IPA. Medium-full bodied and very drinkable despite the 7.5% ABV. An excellent IPA."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.21,"L: Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass. Two fingers of smooth ivory head that slowly dissipates to a thin cap. Lots of soapy lacing on the glass while sipping. The beer itself is a medium amber.

S: the aroma is a mix of tropical fruit an resins darkness.

T: The flavor is redolent with tropical citrus with a solid caramel malt backbone. No particular flavor dominates the palate, but it's all there.

T: Smooth on the tongue, with velvety creaminess. No alcohol burn.

O: This is a fine IPA with excellent flavor and body, well made and worth a couple more cans."
Popular,Jai Alai IPA,4.3,"As a native Floridian, don’t let my bias skew anyone from how fantastic this easy drinking IPA is in the summer sun. Combined with how widely available it is on tap throughout central Florida, this Jai Lai is hard to top."
Popular,Centennial IPA,3.18,"Looks hazy copperish in color. Smells hoppy with a mix of other scents including, blueberry, lemon, evergreen/pine, raspberry, and dill. Something in the smell reminds me of deli style dill pickles. Taste is lemon and grapefruit, hops and pine. While not over bitter, the bitterness does have a long finish. A fine beer."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.23,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 3/30/22), into a pint glass. A hazy copper color with a 2 finger high off white head with visible carbonation that left lots of lacing. A strong hop presence to the nose with an earthy maltiness below. Bitterness in flavor from start to finish with the malts also well represented, very well balanced. Mouth is a wee bit syrupy and medium to full bodied. A fine go to when undecided about what to have."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.99,"I think this is my favorite IPA out of dozens of others that I've tried. I absolutely love the piney smell and taste of centennial hops. This IPA has a perfect malt balance to the ABV percentage and leaves a slight stickiness on your lips. There is nothing wrong with this beer and I've only had this beer out of a 19.2 fluid ounce can and is only sold as singles in only one liquor store out of the 3 we have here in Uvalde, Tx. and all 3 of them suck bad compared to liquor stores in much larger cities but I sure would like to try this beer out of a bottle. Cans tend to effect the flavor of any beverage. Anyway that's my take on this IPA because in my book it's a masterpiece and hats off to the brewers that put it together and made it happen. I read a few really negative reviews that I don't understand but it's possible they picked up some that have gotten hot and then cooled off no telling how many times. I think they should give it a second chance and change their reviews accordingly to their 2nd experience with it. It deserves a higher overall rating than it does for a beer with it's amount of character. I hope this beer never disappears. Hope my review helps others that are looking to try something new and enjoyable in the IPA realm of the craft beer world because this one might just make you cream in your jeans. Be careful!"
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.17,From a tallboy can. Amber color with an inch or so of fluffy beige head. Smells of pine. Medium body and sticky feel. Roasted malt and piney hops. Nicely balanced.
Popular,Centennial IPA,3.92,"Another back of the cooler find at the local beer store. Parts of the labels are torn and smudged but the price was right at one dollar. Took a chance and I think I lucked out.

Poured into a clear glass and it produced a reddish-brown color with a tan-like head. The smell was of hops and possibly a pine. The taste is a pleasant hop bitterness. All in all, it was a good decision."
Popular,Centennial IPA,3.55,"Bought a 15-apck cans $15.99 Target
82 days old
Smell of citrus, pine
Hazy reddish-amber color
Medium mouthfeel

Taste of malt, grapefruit, oranges, some bitterness, alcohol aftertaste. Seems a little thin in the middle.
Overall ok. Not bad for the price."
Popular,Centennial IPA,3.92,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed glass. Light copper in color, slightly cloudy, and one-finger head with moderate lacing.

Smell - a healthy balance of grassy hops and malts, with some honey-like sweet undertones.

Taste - malty sweetness to start, then a rush of floral/grassy hoppy notes accompanied by light to moderate bitterness. the balance is delicate: nothing particularly stands out, but nothing is subdued. finish is slightly sweet with just a tad bit of warmness.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderately boozy at 7.2% ABV.

Overall - an old school American IPA, with excellent balance between malts and hops that gets the best of both worlds."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.58,"My favorite beer! Have always enjoyed bitter, and this beer has it in spades (65 IBU), but it's not too much. Has replaced Saranac Legacy, another very good IPA, as my favorite; Founder's Centennial is now my go to. Has a strong level of alcohol (7.2%) without being too strong. Beautiful copper color, great head, smell, taste, and feel. Also, readily available in my area (upstate NY) at reasonable prices. What's not to love?"
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.55,"Very full flavored ipa. Rich Ale flavors. Not sure how to describe it other than a warm flavor, which is excellent. It’s extremely refreshing and has top tier flavor."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.39,"Mix between a two hearted ale and an all day ipa. Starts with a floral malty sweetness with a hint of pine, malty mellow middle, finishes with a floral piney bittersweet finish. Excellent and I’m not usually big on IPAs."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.26,Liked it overall but this beer fizzes out every time when I open the can no matter what the temperature of the beer. Have to put the mug in the sink and open it over it. Still manage to lost beer as it basically explodes into the glass. No wonder it came in a 15 pack because by the time I’m done it will have really only been a 12er due to the foamed up lost beer.
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.5,"Featuring one of my favorite hops varietals, this rich amber drink offers a crisp, slightly sour bite at the front, that settles into an earthy straw-like exhale...the later more pronounced as it warms. Just enough bread on the bottom to balance this act with magnificence. A King's drink, indeed."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.84,"I love this beer. i play the field, but always come home to this. A lovely clear copper color, fruity but not overwhelming smell, a bit of the oily texture that an IPA should have, and a perfect balance between malt and hops. And it certainly doesn't hurt that it's widely available in my area and quite inexpensive (15 12-ounce cans for about $18)."
Popular,Centennial IPA,3.41,"This beer looks nice and smells nice when pouring, but has a bitter taste on first sip and the aftertaste is even more bitter. It is one of the least enjoyable IPA's I've had. The taste is what I describe as a ""burnt"" hop taste. Old and bitter and sour. If you really enjoy a bitter and sour IPA, this one is for you. Not for me."
Popular,Centennial IPA,4.38,"Pours a hazy copper with an eggshell colored head that leaves gobs of lacing behind. Huge aroma of pine, grapefruit and citrus. Flavors follow, with smome malty sweetness, medium bodied, great carbonation. This is a beer I always keep in the fridge."

Very delicious. Creamy. Smooth mouthfeel. Not too much sweetness.

Excellent beer."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.24,"12 oz bottle into a Founders snifter. Top popped and everything seemed to leap out!
Immediate Scotch aroma fills the space. Lively fizz that lays down quickly.
Taste is Scotch & soda, caramel sweetness, barrel dryness, quick finish.
Feel is old ale heft, low to medium carb.
Overall, supurb sipper.,."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.41,"Pours a dark brownish color with a small tan colored head that didn't last long. The smell was of malt, caramel and a strong alcohol. The taste was that of malt with some caramel and the influence of the scotch barrels for a warm alcohol finish. A really good beer."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.25,"Super hardcore and outrageous scotch and oak barrels combine nicely with the base scotch ale. It’s oaky, a bit roasty, with caramel sweetness, some tobacco and dark fruit. Bombastic but nice."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.36,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Dark brown pour, with a light cream colored foam.

S - Vanilla, caramel, barrel.

T - Caramel, malt, vanilla, peat, black coffee. Starts sweet and works its way into a nice smooth bitterness.

F - Not heavy, but has a nice weight on the tongue. Creamy and dry at the same time.

The barrel cures the weak points of the original Dirty Bastard and turns it into an outstanding Wee Heavy."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.97,"I tried this brew a couple of years ago and remembered that I really liked. Today is the first time I have seen it back in stock at my local beer store so of course I had to try it again. I'm a fan of dark bourbon beers and this one ranks right up at the top. The initial pour unveils a dark amber ale with a short lived frothy head. The smell is sweet with an obvious bourbon scent. The first taste is remarkably smooth and rich, sweetness on the tongue with a mild pleasant bitterness arriving at the end which left me craving for my next sip. Ahhhhh, so yummy! This is a first class sipping beer that you should keep on hand for your favorite house guests...if your the generous type."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.48,"Bottled on 09.27.21 - 2nd try on this one, which drives this very review - found the barrel taste too strong & fresh-coopered first time, but impressions seem to be diminished this round...)

Pour into 5oz snifter leaves an appealing bubbly tan head reducing to cloudy mists on the surface with a bubbly creamy little ring surrounding the fill line. Color such a lovely translucent deep burgundy. Nose is barrel woods, sweet molasses, perhaps a nuance of tangy fruitiness in there too. Taste is a lovely bittersweet, a little tang & fizz on the tongue. Swallow is bittersweet, not overly sticky.

I can see why appreciators like aging this one. It's a sweet lil' treat."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.49,"Fairly dark body, browinish burnt copper color with a decent light tan head. Very pretty aroma: caramel, vanilla & bourbon. Sweet with just of hint of bitter. Very tasty: caramel, brown sugar, spices, bourbon, scotch, ripe dark fruit, vanilla & oak barrel flavors. Medium feel, good carbonation & a fair amount of alcohol heat in the mouth & stomach. Excellent scotch ale."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.51,"This sample was bottled 9/28/12. Poured into a 16oz nonic, a tan off white head forms and quickly dissipates leaving a light cap of foam on top. The color is a slightly translucent reddish brown. The smell is of boozy roasted malts, bourbon and candied dried fruit. The taste is slightly sweet, boozy malt, with notes of dried fruit and bourbon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick. Given the age of my sample I assume the carbonation has toned down from the original packaging, the mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I would definitely buy again."
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.23,"When compared to KBS it is a step lower. BUT - that does not make it undesirable. If you are a connoisseur of ales you will love it. If not - the pilsner people and BudNiks will notice the bloaty feeling and over-handed sweetness and put it down around a stale Oh Henry. Newbies will be hypnotized - the Seasoned will say ""meh."""
Popular,Backwoods Bastard,4.65,"This is a fantastic dark beer, especially considering you don't have to go to a boutique micro-brew in order to get it. It's available at my local grocery store! The flavors are complex without feeling artificial or over-powering. The bourbon barrel aging is evident. It forms a very nice, almost nitro-style head. IMHO, this is the best offering Founders puts out...which is saying a lot since they make some outstanding beers."

Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.41,Wow! Drank this one ice cold and right out of the can. When I opened it the beer was filled right up to the top and sort of just overflowed a bit. The smell was hops and hops and exactly what I like. The taste was definitely of a hoppy nature and the ABV just adds to the enjoyment. I will positively be looking for more when I can.
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.5,"Finally had several of these sent from some NJ family so I can try this top-notch-hyped imperial red. I could never catch it available when visiting. Pours a deep and clear golden color with a modest head.
Nose is like sweet cakey/ candies malts and hops all together, makes me want to taste.
The flavor goes there, it’s so much flavor up front with sweet caramel and tasty hops, just a well-balanced impeccable red IPA. Resin/ earthiness is a defining characteristic, and it’s tasty. Tingly fresh hop bitterness lives in this beer. It ends superbly. Amazing balance.
Feels perfect. Smooth and smooth, then smooth. Slight stickiness, vanishes superbly and I’m ready for more.
I can see why this gets the love.
It’s like a Hop Wallop meets a red ale, masterfully and silky."
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.25,"Pours a nearly clear mahogany color with a small foamy white head and a moderate amount of lacing.

Smells of piney, grassy hops and malt.

Tastes of mildly bitter, peppery hops throughout with smaller tastes malt, caramel and pineapple.

Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth dry mouthfeel.

This beer is an enjoyable mash up of a Wee Heavy and a West Coast IPA. Scotch IPA?"
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.35,"One of those beers I drink plenty of and then surprised that I haven't rated it yet. So anyway, an attractive appearance; clear copper, nice size head, good lacing. Aroma is equally appealing, earthy and herbal with subtle notes of citrus. Resinous quality on the palate along with the herbal influence. Finishes a bit spicy. Bitterness adds depth and balance. Best by date of 5/11/22"
Popular,Nugget Nectar,3.69,Beautiful pour with one finger foam. Smell is pine and malt. The taste is very much on the edge of IPA…..almost too close. I don’t have much experience with this style but if you told me it was an IPA I wouldn’t bat an eye. Keep that in mind before you try …. This is hoppier than your average Red.
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.44,"Poured a very pleasing amber color with active carbonation and a manila folder (Google it if you've never seen one) colored head that left plenty of lacing.
Aroma, even to my chemical damaged nose, was very nice. Obvious malts and hops play parts in the dance; I can't say I got the ""pine, resin and mango"" that the can states are prominent but it is very pleasant.
The taste, found it hard not to think of this as an IPA, it's just on that cusp. Likely the hoppiest red ale I've ever had, but that's not a bad thing at all; it's delicious!
The feel falters only in that it's way to drinkable for it's ABV. I could quaff this down by the liter if given the opportunity.
OA, Seriously good beer, all the way around. The denizens of Hershey, PA are fortunate to have this on tap."
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.29,"Clear and bright body, medium amber colored; excellent carbonation, fine bubbles and gently rising; huge, white head, sculpted and densely creamy. Strong scent of pine resin offset with gentle caramel notes. Outstanding taste, well-balanced and complex; light malt base with a moderate to bold hop bitterness; some peppery spiciness. Medium-heavy body; softly abrasive; light sweetness countered with a moderate overall dryness.

A most extraordinary ale, well-crafted and bursting with balance, flavor, and immensely pleasurable appearance.

L: Orangey-copper, crystal clear, with a substantial head and good retention/lacing. I hate to drink it because it looks so nice.
S: Mostly hop bitterness, a few citrus notes.
T: Just nailed-on balance between the malt and hops, slightly resinous finish
F: Very smooth, a little sticky.
O: Worth the hype, the highlight of the Tröegs lineup for me. Almost by itself makes PA winter tolerable."
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.31,"I suppose I'll contradict myself and say that I'm not overly enthusiastic about beers with ramped up ABV scores. Too often, I find that the pleasure of the mouthfeel is compromised when the main thing you taste is the octane. With that said, I'm always impressed by beers that are a little stronger but bring the complex flavor into the foreground. Seems like that's the kind of thing ""craft"" is all about. I do love the Tröegs company and their creativity and sensibility, but I don't love all their beers (which is no knock on them at all). But for my money, Nugget Nectar is some of their finest work. It's such a pleasurable beer to drink; flavorful with a kind of well-earned sweetness, beautiful balance of the different hop notes and malt, and a stunning color in the glass. Over the years, I've cycled through a number of Tröegs beers, giving many a try, but I'm finally prepared to say that this is my favorite of all I've tried. This is the one I wait for every year and buy whenever it comes to my beer store."
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.24,"L: Copper brown very slightly hazy, good 2-3 finger head

S: Malt but balances with the hops, slightly sweet

T: I get some pretty good hops for an ale, malt, and slightly sour resiny taste

F: Medium-bodied, easy going down, clean finish, moderate mouthfeel

O: A very solid, delicious beer. If would have tasted this blind I would have called it an IPA and while I have not had a lot of red ales this one is excellent. Available only 1x per year around the holidays, lucky I live only about an hour away from the brewery. Troegs hit this one on the head."

Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.94,This beer is really good. Although I would not suggest it for those who just started craft beer drinking. It has nothing in it that would wow a non craft beer drinker. But It has everything a craft beer lover would love in a beer. However the appearance isn’t anything to write about. But I guess that’s ok.
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.23,"12 oz. can, freshest by 4/19/2022. Cream colored foam on a reddish copper body. The aroma is bit weak on this batch but what is there is indicative of the flavor, which is florid, hoppy, and mildly bitter. The red ale aspect is evident in the creamy feel of the body. A wonderful beer for these cold winter nights."
Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.75,"Nugget Nectar Ale has a thick, spongy, ivory head and a clear, bubbly orange appearance, with heavy lacing. The aroma is of dark bread crust and hop resins. It has a similar flavor, with building bitterness. Nugget Nectar Ale has a medium body and a dry finish.

Popular,Nugget Nectar,4.33,"Really solid beer. Drinks enough like an IPA to please a hop head, smooth enough to please most pils lovers, and diverse in profile enough to please most sour seekers. I think it's just a really well-crafted beer. A lot of love was put into making this gem."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,5,"This review is for the 2022 release.

Best beer I have tried in a long, long time. Absolutely fantastic.

So much flavor but not overpowering, wonderfully balanced. Hard to believe it's over 16%"
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4,"Poured from the bottle into a clear chalice-like glassware. Dark amber color. Aromas of caramel, malt, booze, and vanilla. Definitely a strong feel of the alcohol, but it doesn't overwhelm."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,3.7,"Been wanting to try this beer out for a long time now and finally came across it at a local liquor store that sells a wide range of craft beers from all over. The store owner said that he was sent two cases of it. So anyway, I pay $40 (!) for a 4-pack and rush home to put a bottle in the freezer… First off, it looks fantastic. Pours a deep copper color with good lacing on the glass. The smell was a little surprising though; seemed very malt-forward, like a good beer that had sat in an unconditioned garage for a couple of years and the hops had been burned out of it (yes, I’m familiar with such scenarios; when you have wildly varying temperature changes of 20 degrees in the winter and 110 in the summer, that ugliness can play havoc on an unprotected beer. Welcome to NW Florida). The taste was unexpected as well. I thought some serious hop action was on the way but said hops seemed nonexistent. I typically don’t care for hop heavy beers but hey, a balance would be nice. And strong? Yeah, you could say that. You can almost feel the alcoholic vapor rising up out of your chest. I couldn’t find an ABV anywhere, although BA says it’s in the 18-20% range and that seems about right. So bottom line, this is a serious beer that demands attention. Is it all that I expected? Not so much. A good barley wine maybe. Don’t get me wrong, I like this brew, but I guess the hype just left me wanting a little bit more. Still, I feel comfortable giving it a solid 4 out of 5."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.57,"My father in law gave me a $50 bill to spend on some fancy beer, so this is what I chose. I saw the 4 pack sitting on the shelf for $42 and knew right away that's how I'd spend the money. I've had the 60 minute and 90 minute as everyday drinkers at my local bars on Saturday nights out, but never thought too much about them. But I knew given this beer's reputation I had to try it eventually. Poured out pure gold, richly golden, glowing with a copper luminescence, but it's murky and dense, and cannot be seen through. A beautiful white head formed that dissipated into a mess of mismatched bubbles around the rim of the glass. The smell is all orange and lemon zest, perhaps some grapefruit in there too. No alcohol on the nose. The taste is richly citrus and a full strong wash of hops, bittering and balancing the sweetness of the fruits. Hints of grass and wheat, and a golden touch of honey complete the sphere of flavor. The beer bounces around in my mouth in a lively brew of bubbles, and is quite thin and watery that goes down quickly and easily. I cannot detect the astoundingly high ABV that is present in this beer. This tastes rich and full, but not any more strong than what i remember the 90 minute to be. Overall, this is quite refreshing and lively, thirst quenching and smile inducing. It's not particularly unique, but i don't think it has to be to earn higher marks from me. I'm in Florida and in this heat this is the perfect summertime brew and I'm glad I'm drinking it on vacation. I noticed several reviewers are comparing this to a barleywine, and I would agree on that point. Two thumbs up."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,5,"This is the most satisfying, delicious, and outstanding DIPA I have ever had the pleasure of consuming! Words are unable to describe the blast of flavor. Clocking in at 16% ABV and 120 IBU, the absolute highest, this brew will not disappoint!"
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.4,"Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, 15-20% ABV. Pours clear copper with a two-finger off-white head that left prolific lacing. Nose is sweet toffee/caramel.

I've drank many times over the years so decided to review."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.44,"Better categorized as a Barleywine - this potent potable is strong, sweet and bold. Not for a casual drink, the 15-20% abv asserts itself more quickly than this guy is used to experiencing. Tastes sweet, with an excellent mouth feel."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.04,"2022 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours golden copper amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little thin lacing.

S: Sweet bready malt, big honey, citrus, floral notes, dark and stone fruit, some spice, resinous pine, and a bit of alcohol that gets stronger as it warms.

T: Candied citrus, orange marmalade, lemon, and grapefruit, resinous pine, spice, underlying fruity notes, apricot, peach, fig, white grape, and golden raisin, bready malt, brown sugar and honey sweetness, and a little alcohol.

M: Full body, moderate carbonation, slightly syrupy, definitely a little alcohol warmth, though it's pretty well managed and never really gets unpleasant or overwhelming.

O: Another beer I know I've had before, but never logged, so here we go with a fresh bottle to establish a baseline before cracking into a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it's an absolute behemoth. The 2022 edition sits at 16.6%, so not the full 18-20% of old, but still plenty big. There is a hop presence so there's no denying it's an IPA, but there's also a ton of sweet malt there as is required to hit that ABV. Well made and fun to try fresh to say you've had it (Go for a short pour or share a bottle with a buddy), but if you're after a big and hoppy experience, stick to DIPAs and TIPAs. (4.04)"
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.17,"2019 bottle.

Pours a cloudy, semi-opaque dark brown color. Thin off-white head forms and dissipates quickly leaving just a thin layer of foam.

Aroma has notes of old piney hops, light maple sugar notes, some rich malty notes and some mild raisin or date fruit notes.

Taste follows the nose with a blast of rich malts, strong piney hops, with some notes of raisins, dates, caramel, molasses, maple syrup, Even at 4 years old - this is still extremely hot. it warms up the pit of your stomach as you sip on it.

Feel is thick, syrupy, warming and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Semi-dry, trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is a unique beer that is a must try, even if it is not one to drink often. To me, its essentially an American Barleywine - but a really well done one."
Popular,120 Minute IPA,4.18,"Drank way too much of this when on tap locally, outstanding compared to any bottled version previously. This is no light beer by any stretch. Impressively concocted, but there's just a ton of both malt and hop. Fun to try."

So nowadays, I be sitting with my beer buds (or beer and buds as it were, having lain down liquor 16 years ago) and long about 10:00, I’ll whip out a couple of 120’s and split ‘em up in tasters, pass ‘em around. Cheers!
Everybody gets goosebumps, cheeks turn red, and they make ‘that face’. (I truly mean that in the most complimentary way.)

120 Minute IPA is an Extreme Novelty that always satisfies. Sweet and hoppy, boozy and offputting, lowbrow and dispicable - yet the most underrated beer in America.
It’s a nipple pinch - whether you like it or not, you know you got pinched.
Can you dig that?"
Popular,Guinness Draught,4.34,From tap at irish pub in Nördlingen in Germany. Smells like Caramel Coffee. Perfectly balanced taste. Drinks like water. Carbonation makes for a very creamy amazing mouthfeel. From tap is significantly better than Guinness from a can.

Popular,Guinness Draught,4.23,"I've had Guinness before but this is the first rst time trying a Draught. I poured this one into a beer mug. Produced a good head, the feel of it was smooth, and the taste was pretty darn good. I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, a good beer and one I will come back to."

Popular,Guinness Draught,4.56,"The legendary Guinness Draught; What a fantastic debut beer review.

Third beer of the day; one Belgian white and a Guinness. I will never review a beer if it's the first of the day.

Cool 16oz glass. I cracked the burnished gold tab and let the nitrogen/co2 slowly hiss out.

After pouring, there's a bit of fireworks in the glass, let them play it up. 100% fantastic head, moist as the freshest bread. Surface tension keeps it from bubbling over the glass edge, even as it rises above. The perfect pour every time.

Time for the first sip; Not my first rodeo with Guinness, I dive right in. Caramelly toast waft as this signature black beer cuts through the soft foamy head. Great mouthfeel as the cold rush of stout emulsifies with the head. Sweet chocolate and bitter malt on the tongue. As smooth as nice whisky. The first sip of Guinness is one of the best, 5/5.

Midway there's a bit of Irish bog to traverse, as while this isn't the thickest stout it's vast and muddy nonetheless. But the nice chocolaty bread really shines through even as it warms.

The last few sips are a bitter-tooth brew eater's paradise. As I finish the beer, residual head and newly sloshed foam splatter the glass artfully. The taste of malt on the last sip radiates out to fill your nose up playfully. Even with its mild 4.2% ABV, the bitterness gives me a bit of a woozy headspace.

As I grab another Guinness to fill my empty glass, I note the almost cakelike foam at the bottom. Scrumptiously bitter, yet may negate that aforementioned surface tension. Gotta get a fresh glass!"

22oz bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind

S- smoky charred malt, black licorice, dark chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, coffee and caramel

T- intense charred malt up front gives notes of anise, burnt toast and dark roast coffee. Mid-palate gives some dark fruit notes of raisin, fig and prune, along with dark chocolate. The finish gives more charred malt

Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.32,"2014 Vintage dated opened in 2021. It pours a stygian dark brown with a modest light brown head that soon diminishes to nothing. The scent is big: roasted and black malts abound. The taste follows the nose, with a nice blackened malt flavor that doesn't disappoint. Yum!"
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.04,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV 10.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head. Nice aroma of dark malts and chocolate. Fine roasty flavour, notes of strong coffee and dark bitter chocolate."
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.4,So I let my stout age in my cellar for about 8 months and all I can say is wow. It really aged awesomely. I am super happy I chose to wait on this one because this stuff is dope. Stone for life
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,3.43,Pitch black. A small amount of head appeared. Sweet smell of dates/ fruity. Can taste molasses. Notice the strong alcohol taste. Not a very sticky feel.
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.43,"This is a 22oz bottle of the '2014 RELEASE'. Label displays 11%ABV.
Nearly opaque black colored body, with the thinnest of bottom edge showing dark brown back lit highlights. Two finger tan creamy head, which recedes to thin cap and ring. Leaves behind some rings of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dark fruits.
Taste is dark roasted malts, which express dark chocolate and dark roast coffee. The dark fruit shows up close to the end. The black licorice is a minor note throughout.
Full mouth feel, super creamy. Good carbonation.
The alcohol is there but not super strong. This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.

Bottle Notes:
Brewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!"
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.24,"Bottled in March 2016. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, espresso tan foam with medium low retention. Rich, dark roasted and grainy malt aromas with dark chocolate and earthy, tobacco-like notes and light booziness. Rich and full bodied with medium light carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Roasted malt flavors up front with notes of dark chocolate and charred grainy malt. Medium earthy hop bitterness through the middle followed by chocolate and dark malt flavors. Bitterness transitions to warming booziness to the end. Finished semi-dryly with bitter dark chocolate and roasted maltiness with a light boozy heat. Great aromas and rich flavors with a fabulous feel and pleasant warmth."
Popular,Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,"2015 version - bottled 03/05/15, so just short of 4 years. Pours a thick black with brown head, reddish highlights. Smell is sweet roasty coffee, bit of dark fruits, licorice, and faintly chocolate. Tastes more of the dark chocolate but still with coffee, hints of the licorice, a bit oaky. Smooth rich mouthfeel - notes of the booze - but a bit of that lingering coffee bitterness at the finish. Warm and inviting of another sip."
Popular,Duvel,4.56,"L - Poured from a standard bottle into a large wine glass. Huge head on mild pour. Light golden clear color. Head slowly dissipates to thick suds with mild lacing, and then to a healthy film that stays through the beer.

S - Light fruit and sweet scents up front. Some apple and possible citrus. A pleasant sweet yeast scent appears part way through drinking. Some more earthy tones are noticed as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet fruits like apple, pear, and mild citrus., but adds some spice in there. Some muted floral notes appear as you drink. Not bitter though. More of a sweet yeast flavor as you drink. And then some more earthy flavors come out as well as it warms up. Agitation brings back the sweet fruit characteristics, but definite sweet yeast as the main flavor. Somewhat boozy toward the end.

F - What a smooth mouthfeel at first. A healthy amount of carbonation stays as you drink it. Top notch.

O - Overall, this was a fantastic and enjoyable beer. I had casually avoided Duvel assuming it was a generic European macrobrew. I was wrong and this beer is a treat. I will definitely add it to my regular rotation."
Popular,Duvel,4.51,"Gifted from a friend and couldnt wait to indulge but took about 10 minutes to pour, so I waited. Beautiful look pillowy head, golden color, slight aroma, bready, taste of clove, banana spice, prickly mouthfeel, hoppy but balanced - worth the wait, good beer"
Popular,Duvel,4.89,"Great beer and a reliable go-to for so many situations. Light golden pour with great carbonation and a huge, lasting white head. Spice, bread, and fruit, with a mix of white grape, apple, and pear. Very effervescent and a nice, dry finish. Fantastic. Never disappoints."
Popular,Duvel,4.17,"Pours a beautiful, clear pale golden-straw colour. Three finger thick white creamy head slowly compacts into a one finger, dense foam that lasts the rest of the beer.

Interesting and subtly complex aroma, slightly sour aromas of gentle funkiness. Earthy, more like damp leaves and wood than a horse barn kind of funk. Yeasty esters play around with a slight bitter, floral and grassy hop smell. Subtle banana and cloves, typical of most Belgians. I might have an older bottle, but I swear there is a vinous, grapey smell as well on a deep inhale. A tiny bit of bready, toasty malt, but I find it takes a backseat to the sour viney damp smells.

Taste is very subtly complex as well, very pale and gentle sourness on the tip. Earthy and moist like wheaty aromas. Some subtle yeast notes with the malt. There is a savouriness as well here. I’ll mention again I think my bottle is older, which has brought out some nifty aromas and I think tempered the flavours a bit and evened them out. Some bitter citrus peel is noticeable as well, and a pleasant bitterness on the finish that is semi-sweet, a bit viney, with a white grape like taste.

I didn’t notice the alcohol as much as others. This is a light-medium bodied beer with good, medium level carbonation. Nice bittersweet, grapey and bready finish that is mostly dry.

Pleasant, complex, and easy drinking. I’d love to try a bottle that is super fresh just to compare. I’ll leave the review like this for now and hopefully come back soon!"
Popular,Duvel,4.55,"Pours a translucent lemon yellow with a healthy white head creamy/foamy. Smell is (wow) first impression is lemon, decaying autumn leaves, clove,almost a pine like scent,very earthy. Taste is spicy herbs,(clove) , hint of banana,some malty goodness. Feel is well carbonated,(think champagne) finishes dry and juicy, Overall this is not like any other Belgian beer. I had this many years ago in Brussels and it still tastes just as good. Really good-"
Popular,Duvel,4.18,"Smells like a citrus and bread, maybe even a small bit of grassiness that is also in the flavor. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some bitterness in it but not bad, some small fruit smell and flavors along with malt and barley and breads. The alcohol is noticeable but not too noticeable, to me this is the perfect higher ABV taste, with bold flavors but not a whiskey taste. As you continue drinking it gets more and more enjoyable. Great beer. Not a note-able aftertaste. The feel is semi-heavy."
Popular,Duvel,4.35,"Smells sweet like honey as soon as I opened the bottle. A little banana as well. Tastes of banana and bubble gum. This beer is very carbonated and I feel it overpowered the taste. It is a good beer, glad I tried it but doubt I will ever buy it again due to price. I would love to try it on tap someday to see if it is less carbonated."
Popular,Duvel,4,"As a someone who was introduced to Belgian ales from Unibroue's interpretations, I was excited to find one of the staples in my local liquor store. I had a great experience with the Chimay range and was looking forward to this one.

Nose: Mild, semi sweet malt

In the Glass: Well foamed or formed head, rises quickly to show it's pale golden shine. Great looking beer.

Palate, Crisp, orange citrus, sharp bitterness that fades into a full body of well malted barley. Crisp and sharp but not bitter.

Finish: That sharp citrusy body fades into a mellow alcohol and malt flavour.
Overall I can see why people covet this Ale. Unlike Chimay and Unibroue's offerings you do taste the High ABV with this one, hence the 4/5 rating. Not perfect but a fantastic ale."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.4,"Just bought in a bottle from my new local supermarket in Paris, never had before, not sure what to expect...

Bottle looks pretty cheap. Not expecting much...

Dark, deep, lingering foam...more even more beautiful than Guinness.

Aroma is natural, deep and inviting. Though a little too carbon dioxidey (in case you are foreign, that is not a word, I just created it...)

Very flavoursome, smooth and highly drinkable, for 9%. Reminds me of Christmas, even though it is August. Bitter, citrussy, loving it. Most stouts and dark beers are much too choclatey and heavy...this is still light, despite the high alcohol content. Definitely going to be drinking more of this. Unfortunately not tonight as my supermarket closes in 8 minutes and I live on the 7th floor with no lift, typical hardcore parisian style.

In Paris I remember I went to a bar opposite my apartment, ordered one of these...drank it in about 5 minutes...ordered another and drank it in 5 minutes. And then ordered another. The bitch French (Senegalese) bar maid told me that I had already had 2 and that now I can only have water. WTF!? So I went to a different bar. In England you could order 10 in 1 hour and they would love you for it.

Very good feel, it really zings in your mouth and the bubbles themselves have flavour. But not as amazing feel as some West Coast IPA's from America. However because of the smoothness and high alcohol content...and I guess premium ingredients...the high from drinking a few of these is amazing. Dark beers always keep you in control, unlike lagers, pilsners and IPA's. I have no idea why this is, maybe it's chromatics.

This beer is pretty cheap in Paris, and the best I have had so far that they sell locally. Will have to be careful as it probably will not mix too well with my current 7th floor no lift parisian style.

I would add that this beer is variable in my experience...

Although for me many West Coast IPA's are better than this overall, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would probably choose this one."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.31,"I'm reviewing a bottle from 2021. At the sight it shows a dark brown color. As soon as it is poured into the glass, a very compact and balanced foam is formed. The nose is not particularly articulated, perhaps notes of cherry and spices as well as a strong hint of alcohol stand out.
At the first sip all the sweet character of banana and chocolate comes out, which was a little covered on the nose and now is released. Overall, I was particularly struck by the strong and balanced flavor of this beer that I would approach very well with a tasting of cured meats and cheeses.
Overall rating 4.5."

F: Smooth, like velvet, with a slight alcohol burn. Full bodied, and strong.

O: A marvelous, and timeless classic. I need to get more and age it. It rank it with Trappiste Rochfort 10 and Samichlaus Classic. Top tier."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.37,"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Half finger tan head. Dark cola color. Minor lacing. Some alcohol legs.

S - Malty and boozy. Some dark fruits like an after dinner wine. Sweetness in there as well.

T - Sweet with some spices in there. The spices were unexpected, but a great extra taste. Bready / Biscuity Malt. No bitterness. Some booziness, but not over-alcohol tasting at 9% ABV. Each taste changes a bit. Keeps you coming back for more.

F - Good carbonation. Medium thickness on mouthfeel. Almost creamy with agitation to bring back the head.

O - I really like this. Drank it at the beginning of Spring, but would be a great Winter / Fall beer. I loved the surprising sweet and spicy taste. Will definitely add this to the annual rotation."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.77,This beer is a beautiful thing - a beautiful large head sitting atop a rich dark ale . With such a strong alcohol content it will certainly knock you out a bit but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Great fruity and caramel flavours - you can taste the history here. Not an every day drink but certainly good for a colder day of the week - especially if you have one of the wide Chimay glasses at home..
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.56,"Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a slightly off white head that slowly grows to be over five inches thick. Over the course of a few minutes it slowly recedes to a creamy looking millimetre cap on top. Lovely looking beer.

I honestly thought I smelled aromas before I unbottled it. Lots of the typical notes are here, doughy and yeasty malt flavours, backed by a general sweetness and mild booziness, rum raisin cake, a deliciously deep and sweet savoury note, maybe dark chocolate covered dried dark fruits? Spices abound, hard to pick them apart, but you can always expect cloves and just a hint of liquorice. It’s really something else

The taste? It absolutely follows the nose, but the way it does it is what makes this such an experience to drink. Aside from what you get on the aromas, I’ll point out the most notable flavours. Bubbly, creamy, and boozy up front. You get hints of rum soaked, moist raisin cake. Spices hit you soon after and meld seamlessly, cloves nutmeg and liquorice are notable here. Deliciously yeasty and toasty caramel malts can be tasted throughout the sip and become quite notable at the end, augmented by the spices and sweetness, sort of tastes like you just had toasted bread with butter and cinnamon. Some dark cherry notes here and caramelized banana. Likely due to the high abv% mixing with the fruity esters and the caramel malt flavour, but it makes for some unique and tasty flavours. Perhaps just the slightest hint of general hop bitterness throughout.

Long and complex finish, which is mostly dry and fairly sweet. I didn’t pick up much bitterness myself. More lively carbonation than you might expect, but the carbonation is quite fine. Creates a creamy sip on the way down and prickles at your tongue. ABV% is slightly more noticeable than some other high alcohol beers, but it’s still masked well and the way you feel it with the flavours/it adds to your taste perception is a plus, honestly.

Phenomenal beer, honestly. Mine was a few months old, would love to try an aged one. I think it helped bring the effervescence down slightly judging by how carbonated some other reviewers said theirs were. I only have one more in my cellar, and this is a beer I would love to try at all life stages. Super fresh, a few months old, year or two old, and a super old cellared grandpa! Or maybe it’s just indicative that I want to drink a lot of this. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves any Belgian, or European beers. Or honestly, anyone who likes beers at all. It’s a must try!"
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.56,"Received this cellared version in a trade with @Providence - Date code is L11-545 So bottled in 2011? No idea, but he said it was old.
Poured rather darker than expected for an Ale; almost cola brown. The manila colored head lasted a very brief time before retreating just to the circumference of the glass.
The aroma was potent! Lots of dark fruit (Think figs and/or prunes) and a surprising amount of spice - almost akin to a Christmas ale - curious as I wasn't expecting that at all.
The flavor follows, the malts lead the party but the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg?) want to play too. It may be my imagination but it seems they didn't want to get along. Didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it anyway.
The feel was better than expected if this is indeed an 11 year old bottle. I would not have guessed that at all; but now I kick myself for not grabbing a fresher one for a side by side.
Really good beer, but then, that seems to be the consensus."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.6,"This one is prototypical of the style for me, a classic for good reason. I've had it many times, but not recently, and never reviewed til now.

Strong aromas and flavors of deep caramel, spiced figs, cherries and roast malts. Lively carbonation and bright yeast esters, good sweetness at the front with a dry finish.
Outstanding beer."
Popular,Bleue (Blue),4.25,"Pour is a light cola colored, but once in the glass it's a much deeper, darker brown. While the pour was fairly aggressive, there was more head than I anticipated, although it only last a couple minutes before receding to a thin spotty cap. Aroma is loads of rich malts, caramel & figs. Taste more or less follows the nose, with some bready notes joining the party. Well balanced, deceptively complex, and super easy drinking in a way that belies its ABV. Very good."

Feel...Definitely a lightness not expected and light lacing presence on the beer.
Overall...a decent beer just not my cup of tea. Don't get the excitement of this style so my score definitely reflects that. i am glad it was a gift because the price on these suckers are exorbitant."
Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, bottled on 7/21/22

On the pour a fine khaki 2 finger head formed then slowly receded and became rocky, as well as clinging to the glass. The body is a nice amber to red with light carbonation. Beautiful lacing.

Aroma is big sweet caramel toffee malts with just the right amount of lightly fruity british ale yeast. Not as big smelling as I expected.

Taste is huge. At first it's all the malt and the yeast notes, before a big wave of bitter hops come to balance the almost candy like malts. A decent bit of alcohol can be tasted as well but it works with everything else going on. The finish is almost holiday spicey, with a bit of sweetness. It would pair well with whiskey, although it's not quite as spirit adjacent as a barrel aged beer nor as smoky as a Rauchbier. Honestly a nice change of pace withing my preferred category of malty beers without the change just being to add American hops.

Feel is very mouthcoating with a light to medium carbonation, but this beer has quite a body to it. On the lips it feels thicker than water, and it almost slides down the throat, but it's very smooth. At the same time there is a bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol which definitely slows me down a bit, but this type of beer is meant to be savored, not to refresh.

Overall this was a very enjoyable wee heavy scotch ale. A bit more hoppy than most are, but they aren't fruity, just big bitter, and I think European as well. Big malts shine and are sweet but nicely balanced, and a great beer to kick off the fall season here."
Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.06,"Milk chocolate brown, reddish shine, large tan head retains well and leaves decent lacing. Smell reminds me a little of some wheat beers I don’t really like.

Popular,Dirty Bastard,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter at fridge temp. Rich foam, good retention. Sweet on the nose, toffee, medium roastiness. Taste is classic wee heavy with a nice hop note. Perfect carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a tasty treat that’s on the button and not overpowering."
Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.32,"Dirty Bastard dumped into a 20oz. glass out of a 12oz. bottle. Picture perfect dark brew slight amber shade when held up to a light. There was a solid three finger dark, thick, tan head. The foam retention is excellent! This is clear enough that when held up to the light I can observe a high amount of carbonation.
The aroma is a pleasant sweet roasted malts, and caramel notes.
The flavor is sweet caramel but dry, with a light bitter finish.
The feel is medium, dry as I said, the carbonation is not prevalent on the tongue, after several sips and the brew warms I can pick up a bit of ABV heat, but it does not take away from the enjoyment of the flavor or session.
This is a very good Scotch Ale, one that I will revisit."
Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.78,First time trying this beer and I have to say it's pretty darn good. As soon as I saw the color I was thinking Guinness but taste completely different than how it looks.

Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.09,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. dark copper in color, lightly hazy with some suspended particles. one finger head with excellent lacing retention.

Smell - caramel, toffee, and lots of malty sweetness. some booze detectable. warm spices and yeast also detectable.

Taste - an explosion of malt flavor and some syrupy sweetness, though also balanced with bitterness. not much smokiness, contrary to what is advertised on the bottle. finish is warm. heavy, but not overwhelmingly so.

Feel - medium-full bodied, low carbonation, and on the heavier side at 8.5% ABV. alcohol is not masked but is not harsh. in fact, the warmness gives this beer an extra layer of added complexity.

Overall - a very complex and very tasty malt-heavy beer that showcases a wide range of flavor while remaining surprisingly drinkable."

Overall: Great beer."
Popular,Dirty Bastard,4.41,"I’ve heard so much hype surrounding Founders that I decided I’d finally give them a try, I would have sooner if it weren’t for the price. The Dirty Bastard seemed the most likely to be up my alley. After arriving home to pour into a glass and take my first sip, I immediately realize what I’ve been missing. This beer hit me on the first sip with such rich and delightful flavor, something that you kind of take for granted in beer when you’re not used to it. Instead of trying to explain the soul of this ale, I just want to say that this was a perfect first try from this brewery and really enjoyed the experience the beer brought me."

T - Deep dark caramels, brown bread, and molasses. Darkened toast comes through the most, though. Bitter, but not overbearingly so; it goes well with this brew. Ethanol comes through towards the end of the glass.
F - Warms your body like nothing else! Smooth. Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Very heavy.

Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.48,Pours a solid golden amber color with finger or two foamy head. Smells of a toasty caramel scented malt. Tastes the same with smoothness similar to a Irish red but slightly different. An absolute fall classic and is loved by most. There is a reason this is a common draft amongst establishments in the fall. Boston does it well with this Sam Adams seasonal.
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint shaker and had to pour in stages as the head was so aggressive. The color was beautiful copper with the manilla colored head, looks enticing.
The aroma was ideal for a Märzen style, the malts and caramel and touch of spice, oh, this smelled good.
The taste was okay, a letdown after the hard sell- the aforementioned malts were there but rather undefined. It was curious after the aroma was so spot on and the taste just dropped off. Weird.
The feel was excellent, no worries there.
Smooth and so easy to drink.
OA, very strange, parts of this excel but somehow the flavors can’t back the rest up."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,1.18,"Did I just get a bad batch or do I need a tastebud transplant?

It doesn't even smell or taste like beer. I can't even tell you how it tastes as I can't find the words to do so.

I was drinking Bell's Octoberfest last week. Enjoyed it very much.

Thought I would save a few dollars this week, but ending up throwing away $12.99 for Samuel Adams.

Ugh."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.14,"I returned to SA Octoberfest after about 10 years away, and I can't say that the time has done it any favors. I remember a good quality Marzen with a nice flavor profile that, yes, sometimes had its off years, but on the whole was a steady performer in the American O-fest scene.

The only constant from the beer I remember is the great look, a beautiful dark amber. The rest just seems muddled. For me, the taste is a bit off, with a flat malt expression that doesn't have much character or depth, and too much bitterness on the finish. Maybe they've increased the hop bill to meet current tastes? Well it doesn't suite my palate. While nicely medium bodied, it has an unfortunate tendency to syrup-coat your mouth after the swallow.

Would I choose this over a lot of other standard party/bbq offerings? Absolutely. But with so many great, small craft options these days, it might be another 10 years before I buy SA Octoberfest again."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.79,"Had on tap (alledgedly tapped yesterday) at Hoffbrau Bar and Grill in Westminster, CO

On arrival a fine one finger head was present that relatively quickly dissipated to a ring around the rim and very light covering. Carbonation is lazy and fine in a reddish brown amber body. No lacing.

Aroma has some nice lightly estery Germans tyle lager yeast with a very low hopping rate. A nice nutty roasted malt is peeking its head through pretty aggressively.

Taste is similar to the aroma with a low hopping rate, and a surprisingly flavorful but pleasant German style lager yeast that plays a big role here. Once the fermentation character passes a big wave of nutty roasted malts takes over.

Feel is insanely drinkable with a medium body for easy drinking but a bit more body for that oktoberfest. Very soft and smooth. Not the sweetest but the malts are mouthcoating. On the medium finish it starts drying out a bit.

Overall this is a very nice malty oktoberfest. Flavorful and it tastes German. Very light hops as per style, but it doesn't go great with hoppy amber lagers as I just found out."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,1.52,"Created an account just to say that I agree with the review posted by ABeingWhoDrinksBeer in Dec 2021.

Overly malty and enough sweetness to ruin the brew. I also get a hint of chocolate, which doesn't work for me in a beer.

Looks good, but that's about it.

Unfortunately, the Pacific Northwest is awash in IPAs, which makes it hard for someone like me who's not a huge IPA fan to find a decent craft beer that isn't an IPA. I spotted this in Costco and figured, ""I like Sam Adams, how bad could this be?"" and proceeded to buy a case of 36 (!) bottles.

I sure hope one of my buddies like this... I can't bring myself to dump it down the drain."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.93,"An ok entry level Oktoberfest style beer.
It's missing the malt complexity of a true German beer of this style, but overall it's not bad. There's better by far."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.93,"Bought pint of draft at a minor league ball game, so I paid way too much for a beer. Rich golden, reddish, tan color with off white foam that diminished after a few minutes. Pleasant aroma and taste was malt leading with a smooth finish. Enjoyable brew, would buy a 6 pk for a better deal."
Popular,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.68,"I saw this at the store today and had to buy the 12 pack. Excellent beer—good head, medium carbonations, malty with hints of sweetness and slightly bitter."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.02,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.18,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. Big time piney, resinous hop aroma, some citrus, with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering, long lasting finish"
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.3,"From a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). Ok retention and lacing.

Smells of fresh cut grass and pint. Also got a hint of marijuana.

Piney, resiny, bitter taste. 95 IBUs in their glory-Right in the wheelhouse for a WCIPA. Some malts in there as well-bit of caramel.

Very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. Strong bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This is a WCIPA. Hit the mark squarely. And stinking enjoyable too."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.15,"Haven’t had this in almost 10 years so here go: pours a deep, dark gold with decent head. Smells of grapefruit and herbal hops. Tastes like grapefruit rind, melon, orange, strawberry, it’s bitter, and a little herbal with a string malt base. A little dry, also, and very drinkable and balanced. Whether this is close to the beer I had back in 2012 is hard to say, and I’m way more tolerant of hops now than then, but this is good and I’ll buy it again, cheers!"
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.35,"An outstanding example of the style, West Coast IPA. Pours an inviting amber/orange with 1 finger of foamy off white head. Nose is full of pine needles and citrus. Taste follows the nose. Grapefruit and Pine, rounded out by Carmel malt with a dry and bitter finish. Worthy of its outstanding rating."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.1,"An all-around great IPA, bursting with citrus and tropical flavors amidst its dry hops. The rich orangey-amber color is particularly inviting. A solid, if not exceptional west coast IPA."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.21,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.3%. Orange to amber colour, moderate head, slightly off-white. Lovely and intense aroma of citrussy American hops, hits you as soon as the bottle is opened. Also notes of tropical fruits and pine. Some sweetish malts in the background. The flavour is neither too sweet nor too dry, and is a veritable hoppy explosion from start to finish. Grapefruit, bitter orange marmalade, pine needles, resin. A classic!"
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.16,"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a deep clear orange hue with half an inch beige head. Plenty of hops, pine on the nose. Taste is of tropical fruit with the bitterness of grapefruit. Pine, citrus. Very drinkable and interesting IPA...well balanced for the blend of hops."
Popular,West Coast IPA,3.75,"Pours a crystal clear dark gold with a creamy white head.

Smells like sweet biscuit maltiness with pine and tangerine.

Sweet biscuity malt on the palate, finishing with a nice drying pine bitterness and a hint of grapefruit.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol warmth is present, but blends in.

Overall, a solid, textbook example of the style. It will scratch the itch if WCIPA is the itch that you have."
Popular,West Coast IPA,4.09,Clear amber body with a dirty beige head that crashes in on itself before too long. Piney scent combines the alcohol and hops in a spicy to near astringent aroma. Toasty malt base gives a hint of sweetness along with some pith before spicy hops start to wash over the malt. Pine follows right on the heels and dries the medium light-bodied drink.
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,5,"Delicious for an American maibock. Was not a fan of rogue beer, but this one is delicious, I recommend it, 6.8 and bitterness around 30. Smooth and doesn’t get yoy drunk !!"
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.26,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle
Glass: 0.5L Pokal
Pouring Temp: 50.6 F


Look:
Deep and slightly hazy copper with an initial 2-finger creamy light beige head. The head dissipates to a thin but consistent cover with excellent soapy lacing down the glass.

Smell:
Tons of sweet bready malts laced with honey and either toffee or caramel. There is also a subtle earthy note along with hints of floral hops.

Taste:
Starts with bready malts and toffee then a strong earthiness asserts itself and dominates the taste. A light bitterness also appears alongside the earthiness and grows throughout the sip.

Feel:
Smooth feel. Body is medium with a slight lean towards the lighter side.

Overall:
A nice beer full of strong but balanced flavors. It reminds me of an ESB more than a Maibock, but regardless, it is a solid brew.

My ratings reflect how the beer smells/tastes/etc as a Maibock.
If this was categorized as an ESB my ratings would be more akin to the following (give or take):

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4
Combo: 3.94"
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,4.45,"L: classic dark whiskey colored beer, light white head. Looks like it belongs on a postcard.

S: gingerbread malts, a little alcohol bite, sweetness, and dark fruits.

T: follows nose, feels very Christmasy. There some pineapple in there too but it’s so well blended it’s hard to tell. Something just stands out I’m not sure what it is.

F: medium- full body. Not heavy, just says hello.

O: felt more like a winter beer than a spring one, but happy to try and enjoy it. This is a local brew and the style isn’t represented enough where I live otherwise I would have tried the style years ago. This nails what I imagine a classic winter/spring hearty food ol beer would taste like."
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.89,"Canned 3 months ago on 10/19/21
Poured into a shaker, small head that thinned out quickly. Minimal lacing, glass might not have been beer-clean. As seen in at least one other review, honey-colored is the best color descriptor. Rising effervescence.
Smell is malt, floral and apple
Taste is semi-malty with slight grapefruit bite
Feel is okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. Bitterness balances the taste and feel.

Hard to rate this one. I wish the ""Overall"" rating carried more weight here. Each individual attribute is better than mediocre, but the sum of its parts is much better than one might think if considering each aspect individually. It's a good, solid, well-rounded tasty beer. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but if I was at the store and on the fence about what to buy and saw it, I'd remember, ""Hey, that was a good one"""
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.5,"Haven’t had this one in like a decade. Floral notes, caramel and bready malt. Light grapefruit and lemon. Fairly sweet but nice mild dry floral bitterness on the finish. Solid balance and drinkability."
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.36,"Everyone keeps saying that this is heavy on the malt. I was expecting a nice malty flavor but was greeted with something a little more akin to an IPA due to the heavy addition of bitter hops. Beautiful honey color and a sweet smell on the pour. I am not an IPA fan, so this wasn’t for me- however, I liked this better than other hoppy beers."
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,4.16,"Pours a beautiful murky caramel. A few fingers of tan bubbly, foam rises and recedes to an off white ring leaving soapy lacing. Nose is green apple, honey, and sweet malt. Taste is honey, oak, roasted malt, biscuit, grass, and lemon. All melding together perfectly to create a truly delightful masterpiece. Feel is silky smooth and very full. Love this and will buy more."
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.87,This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.
Popular,Dead Guy Ale,3.57,"Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style.
Smells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good.
Tastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.15,From a 550ml bottle. Jet black with a quarter inch of medium brown head. Smells of roasted malt. Full bodied. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors with some hop bitterness on the finish. Well done. I'm so used to the high-octane RIS that it's interesting to get this style at only 7%.
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.39,"Pours an excellent, dirthy, viscous and full bodied dark, deep black. No light bleed. Head is hanging around and is deep earthy brown. Nose gives huge elements of baltic porter, like zywiec or black boss: toffee, caramalt and some solid residual brown sugar leading into a hint of oxidized hops (nose), liqourice (licorice?), plum, cane sugar, maybe some smoke (but the weber is going so who knows)

Hell of a beer, really complex. Those notes above all pertain just the same in the flavor, but just in phases. Like from fruity to chocolatey to smokey and on and on just evolving."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.19,"Poured into a tulip a nice black colored liquid capped by a light brown head that was dense and soft looking. Dissipated fairly quickly but still looks good.
The aroma was roasted malts, and for me that is impressive, my nose is broke as far as aroma goes.
The taste, I was somewhat impressed- for a RIS it was very smooth, as in no charred malts and no extra hops, just dense and full roasted malts that bring to mind figs and coffee and chocolate. Really nice!
The feel is likewise smooth as silk, this is just a pleasure to drink.
Glad I finally tried this, it will be a regular in my cellar."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.36,"12-oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass
I had been saving a bottle to review for a while. Father's Day seemed like a good occasion.

A - Samuel Smith always looks fancy, foil-wrapped bottles and all. This one pours a deep pitch black with ruby highlights under 3 fingers of thick dark tan foam, which leaves behind a very nice web of lace. Simply beautiful!

S - dark fruits, touch of chocolate, molasses sweetness, hint of lactic character; inviting

T - dark roasted malts, sweet and tart dark fruits, light sugar sweetness, wooden notes, earthy bitterness; just delicious

M - smooth medium body, moderate carbonation

O - an excellent beer all around; no complaints"

Popular,Imperial Stout,3.83,"Pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of beige head. The nose has some roast along with a background hint of smoked wood. The roasted malts are present in the flavor profile as well along be with a trace of molasses.

Overall, this offering comes off as pretty mild for an impy stout."
Popular,Imperial Stout,3.71,"This is somehow mostly just a sweet boozy mess even tho its 7 percent. I poured into a tulip glass. Not much malt, oats, or chocolate just a sweet alcohol flavor encased in and M&M style malt shell....although I see this is under Russian imperial which does make more sense, I think this is firmly okay but not great for Russian Imperials. It's sweet, a little malt, a little smoke, but things like Expedition Stout or Narwhal are just better to me but this is getting more balanced as I drink just not spectacular."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.4,"Appearance:
Lacquered black, showing glimpses of brown where the light leans into it. It’s topped with a half finger of dark beige fizz that disperses faster than squirrels before a feisty, jack russel. Despite this, it retains a length of drizzly lace until the glass is practically empty.

Bouquet:
Plump figs that were lightly sugared, then rolled in milk chocolate cocoa powder. The after-aroma is intermittent but impressively gourmet: roasted plums brushed with woodsy molasses and given a hearty dunk in black chocolate.

Feel:
A satin-soft full body, simmering with moderate carbonation. Dry, bittersweet linger.

Taste:
Dark malts and oats, browned in a drizzle of maple syrup. Finishes with a spoonful of earthy, dark chocolate pudding."

All of this with a woody and pervasive mineral cast all over it. There are dark soda bread notes in the finish.
F: Medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a moderately dry medium fast finish.
O: A deliciously rich and savory Imperial Stout that has a lot of history for good reason: The famous stone Yorkshire squares. It has superior balance, excellent flavor and has never been specific to any trend. It is incredible in it's style."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.5,"It smells so much like a typical stout that it's almost comical.  There are scents of coffee and chocolate and beery breadwater.  It's almost a stereotype in scent.

The taste follows the nose.  It's a little coffee, a little chocolate and a hole lot of beery goodness.

It's medium bodied with small amount of carbonation.  It's smooth and has a quick bitter finish with a hint of molasses.

It's really good.  It tastes like the father of stouts.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6."
Popular,Imperial Stout,4.06,"Served from the bottle in a Lagunitas mason jar.

Man, it's been waaay too long since I last dove into some Sammy Smith goodness. Let's rectify that straight away, kids. This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit of bulky stout, one that doesn't throw its heft around, rather preferring to please throughout. Good times."
Popular,Racer 5,4.75,"A CLASSIC !!! As WC IPAs go, this one should be included on every list. Golden, resinous and a heavier mouthfeel. Here in the southeast, it’s a welcomed standout when I can find it. Pick it up next time you see it, you will not be disappointed."

Popular,Racer 5,3.91,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light golden color with a large sticky, white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of orange, grapefruit citrus, stonefruit and apricot. Some caramel malts on teh finish.

Flavor: Strong citrus grapefruit and orange citrus flavors upfront. Sort of fades away in the middle. Some caramel and bread malt to finish. Moderately bitter.

Feel: Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation. A clean and moderately bitter finish. (3.75)

Compared to Bells' Two Hearted Ale 5/25/22: Pours lighter, milder aromas. More orange, grapefruit citrus. Less apricot, caramel, bitter pine.

Overall: A really drinkable IPA here. Nice citrus and some slight stonefruit notes. Then a clean and moderately bitter finish. Incredibly clean for 7.5%. This one would sneak up on you. Drinks pretty to style for a West-coast IPA. I don't know that there's anything here that makes this one special. Somewhat surprised by the 93 Rating on BeerAdvocate. Surely it's historical. Maybe my expectations were too high. Nonetheless, a good IPA and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 3.91)"
Popular,Racer 5,3.52,"Golden color with a quickly dissipated head. Hoppy but not overly so by todays standards. Tastes almost like a cross between a lager and IPA of today with a breadth of malt character. Slightly bitter after finish.

Overall this beer probably isn't as much of a knock out as it was when it first arrived, but it still holds its weight for sure."

Popular,Racer 5,3,This is my first time trying it in 2021 and I could tell it was gonna be old school but this is just bore snore. Medium body with extremely light flavor. This is being dominated on by other breweries. After reading some reviews it sounds like fresh on tap is the preference instead of the cans and bottles on the shelf. Which makes sense. This can is 3 months old and just showed up to the store.

Popular,Racer 5,4.27,"I ordered this on tap in Maui of all places and had low expectations going in. Wow did this blow those low expectations out of the water. Malty, citrusy, and bitter, the way an IPA should be. Since then I bought a not-so-fresh six pack, and it wasn’t great. I believe this partially explains the high variance of scores on this site. This beer is underrated for a fresh pour and overrated for a shelf turd. And while that is always the case, it is especially an issue with Racer 5."
Popular,Racer 5,3.6,Poured from a 335ml bottle. About 90 days old since the beer made the journey to Korea. Minimal head. Poured amber and slightly transparent for an IPA. Smells a bit sweet for the style. Taste didn’t knock me out but not bad. Nice balance of bitterness and slightly fruity. Feels full bodied. Little to no aftertaste. Overall a good choice but due to the limited availability here I’ll seek out other offerings from Stone.

Popular,Racer 5,4.13,"Two words can describe this IPA - juicy and hoppy...

This was a huge hop-punch to my mouth - very juicy, and enough booze to pull it all together in a nice looking beer. I was also impressed with the full-bodied mouthfeel.

On the bottle it claims it helped start the on-going hop craze. After having this, I have to agree..."
Popular,Racer 5,4.19,"Reviewed from 22 oz. bomber. No visible date on bottle. This is one I used to drink a lot in the early days of exploring craft beer. It's a local staple at bars in the bay area. I always remember it being a brightly flavored IPA. Let's dive into this glass. Beautiful amber color with a rich creamy head. Beautiful lacing all over the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of pine, orange marmalade, lemon zest and candied malts. I have a feeling this isn't the freshest it could be but it seems approachable enough. The malts give off a slight bready smell. Good taste. Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first. A very well balanced moderately hopped example of a west coast IPA. In a time before double IPA's and triple IPA's this was the go to strong ale along with Mendocino brewery's Eye of the Hawk."
Popular,Porter,3.83,"Oxblood with a thin ribbon of off white foam; cocoa powder, brown bread, and salted peanuts on the nose; salted caramel, brown toast, hazelnuts, chicory coffee, kola nut + slight licorice, light twiggy hopping to end; light, clean, salty, tightening bitterness.

Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old.
Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts.
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout.
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.

A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile.

Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout."
Popular,Porter,3.89,"12 oz. bottle dated 6/18/20

Clear, translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head. Full head and lacing.
Roast malt, gingerbread, earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle.
Nutty sweet roast malt, light hop kick, light char, coffee flavors, deepening as the glass warms. A yeast flavor that I seem to experience in a number of Sierra Nevada beers.
Light hop bitterness, medium feel, lasting carbonation
Substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % ABV ale. Very pleasant."
Popular,Porter,3.71,"Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more."
Popular,Porter,3.47,"Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.

It’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything. I would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors."
Popular,Porter,3.21,"Had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up. The look was different, the carbonation was different, the taste was bland in comparison. Not as good as I remembered."
Popular,Porter,4.1,"Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing
Aroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness
Taste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes
Overall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. A classic and delicious to boot"
Popular,Porter,3.2,"A - Normal pour into chalice producing a dark colored, translucent brew sporting a small 1/8"" inch quickly dissipating head. Low carbonation. Some lacing.

S - Yeast, malt, dark chocolate, and coffee notes. Licorice.

T - Coffee, cream, lactose, some chocolate notes. The aftertaste tends to linger and has an abrasive lactose quality.

M - Thin, relatively clean, somewhat refreshing.

D - This brew has many of the qualities of a milk stout without the robust body. All in all, this is not a bad brew. However, as far as styles are concerned, I feel this brew is a little mixed up."
Popular,Porter,4.09,"A truly pleasant classic right here.
Surprisingly dark black beer with a moderate off white head. Smells vaguely sweet and grainy with a touch of coffee and a touch of cola.
Taste follows with a sweet rich maltiness and a bit of cola on the edge.
Light and pleasant on the palate.
A wonderfully flavorful brew and a simple joy to drink"
Popular,Porter,3.94,"Expectedly dark. Quickly dissipating head, no lacing. Aromas of coffee & chocolate. Taste is not as robust as most other porters, mildly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth. Aftertaste slightly bitter. This would be a non offensive Porter for those wishing to explore this style."
Popular,Porter,3.27,"Not boozy.

Almost syrupy but not strong.

Good with a meal or food but not necessarily a stand alone beer.
Body is neither weak nor strong; aftertaste much the same.

Mediocre but not bad."
Popular,Porter,4.03,"Had this on draft 11/15/19 @ the Beer Temple.

A bit hoppy, but overall a well-crafted take on a classic style. Definitely a true American porter...I'd prefer it a bit maltier but this was very enjoyable."
Popular,Porter,3.79,Not a typical porter. Pours dark. Odd smell. A very mild clean body. Slight roasted malt finish. Smooth. The malt could be more pronounced. It's good but not typical for the style.
Popular,Porter,3.85,"I consume my share of porters in the fall and winter and this one is pretty good, though it lacks greatness. One flaw is that it is a little thin mouthfeel for a porter. The taste is solid, but the roasted malt is not as prominent as it is in some other porters that I prefer. It's solid, but I can usually do better in the style."
Popular,Porter,3.79,Pours up beautifully dark with a thick two-finger tan collar. Nice balance between malt and hops--tastes similar to Sierra Nevada Stout--just slightly less hops coming through. Overall very good.
Popular,All Day IPA,3.92,"Pours a golden color with a decent white head.
The smell is of hops and some citrus.
Taste is of citrus and hops.
Overall, this is a good IPA to have in your refrigerator."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.33,"An above average light beer. Lots of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er. Hard to rate, because there isn't anything ""wrong"" with it, but it's not special in any regard. Piney bitter, little (to no) sweetness. Again, there's a noticeable amount of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.65,"There’s a ‘little bit’ of everything a session IPA should have, but not a damn thing that distinguishes it from the rest of the pack.
Session beers? Drink Local!"
Popular,All Day IPA,3.93,"Everyone else has it pretty much covered. For what I’ll say, there’s quite a lot of additions here to bolster up the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. Flaked corn, wheat, barley, oats. Definitely comes through in the body and finish, body is thicker than any beer at 4.7% should be, crisp finish. Excellent malty, grainy, aftertaste with the weight of a medium bodied beer, despite the beer being a little more sessionable than a full medium-heavy bodied beer . Not particularly bitter, though my tastebuds might be hop fried these days. Founders knows what they’re doing. It’s not unbelievably complex and yet, for a session beer, it also kind of is. Very pleasant stuff."
Popular,All Day IPA,4.37,"Yields a slightly clouded golden amber color with a huge, spongy head.

Smells of ripe oranges, papaya and spicy garden herbs among lighter blueberries and fresh cut limes.

Has an utmost refreshing and light mouthfeel to it, due to its well balanced body and fitting, prominent effervescence.

Tastes of malty, slightly resinous caramel among headstrong, bitter hops, leading with unpretentious limes, as well as more subtle exotic fruits. Offers a pleasant bready middle part, with even more pronounced bitter limes, creating an intriguing, yet easy to comprehend and well working interplay. Finishes with a bit more luscious oranges and papaya among rustic bread rind, a note of resin and long lasting, finish defining bitter limes.

This is great! Such a refreshing, perfectly balanced low abv beer with a satisfying complexity is hard to find."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.54,"You’ve read the reviews. You’ve read the tasting and smelling notes. All you need to know, is that this should be your go to session beer. Happy 4th!"
Popular,All Day IPA,3.93,"Clear light amber color with a moderate ivory head that sticks around fairly well and produces some nice lacing.
The aroma is light sweet malt with citrus and a touch of pine.
The taste is likewise grapefruit, tangerine, light malt with a dry lingering grapefruit pulp and pine resin finish.
The body is medium, fairly smooth, good carbonation, very drinkable.
Altogether this brew is, as advertised, an excellent session brew, especially during warm weather, light and refreshing, enjoy."
Popular,All Day IPA,4.5,"OMG, why have I waited so long to try this beer. Its been out for several years now and it's still the best sessionable IPA I've ever had. Mouth feel is crisp, refreshing, and carbonated. Taste is that of an old school WC IPA, hoppy, malty, with a little pine. This beer is great for day drinking. I'll be keeping my fridge stocked with these guys this summer."

19.2 fl. oz. can ""CANNED ON 03.22.22 21:14;48 1"". Sampled on 05.16.22

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not sure what happened to the review I already did but at the end of it I said that this was my favorite session IPA. Let's see if that stands the test of time. It's poured a lightly hazy deep gold body beneath a full head of slightly off-white foam. The aroma is citrusy and piney over a delicate and lightly bready malt base. On to the taste... it's basically the same. The malt is lightly sweet, bready, grainy, and biscuity. The hops deliver notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and pine. There's a light touch of hop resin to it as well. The bitterness clocks in at 42 IBUs balancing it and bringing it to a dry, bitter finish with some citrus pith and pine lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The head held up pretty well and it's left some nice lacing about the glass. In my opinion this is very much a pale ale with extra hops and that's fine with me. It's 4.7% ABV which is .3% below Budweiser (at least in the U.S.), and 140 calories. I've had multiple servings of this over the course of a day (COVID lockdown!) and I can truly say that it continues to deliver. Now, are there pale ales out there that could do the same thing? Of course there are, but this is an easy go to. If you haven't had it I suggest you try it.

Popular,All Day IPA,3.88,"Had this from a bottle.
A: pours an orange body with small white head with ok retention and lacing.
S: sweet, earthy grapefruit smell with some sweet undertones
T: a grapefruit, hoppy tasting beer; a nice malt taste
M: medium bodied and pretty smooth; fairly crisp
D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking beer overall"
Popular,All Day IPA,4.65,"It’s not exciting, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s fresh, bright, crisp, refreshing, low alcohol, everything it should be. I gave the look a 5 not necessarily for the beer, but the art work on the can. One of my favorite beers of all time."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.84,"Look - poured into a 5 oz tasting glass. dark golden in color, slightly hazy, with not much head but moderate lacing.

Smell - a balance of citrus (both orange and grapefruit) and pine on the nose, along with a bit of sweet malty fragrance.

Taste - light on the palate. moderately hopped with a robust malty backbone that balances well. citrusy hops are detectable on the tongue, but focus is more on flavor rather than bitterness. finish is smooth with lingering hoppy fragrances.

Feel - light bodied, average carbonation, and low ABV at 4.7%.

Overall - this beer is everything as advertised: a sessionable, good tasting IPA that is easy to drink and easily enjoyable by anyone."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.95,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a glass.
The All Day IPA has a nice golden amber color with a good head.
Citrusy aroma, including orange and tangerine with a touch of grapefruit.
The grapefruit and orange flavors come through nicely, but after each sip you're left with an astringent dryness on your tongue.
Light to medium body, perfect for a session beer
It's drinkable, but after one or two the astringency definitely has me wanting to switch to something else."
Popular,All Day IPA,4.35,"Nice mid-hopped moderate ABV IPA. It's called a Session IPA for a reason. Satisfies the IPA hoppiness without blowing you away with bitterness. Purchase 15-pack of cans from Foundry Wines & Spritis in Owings Mills, MD."

F: Dry, a little resiny.
O: Nothing extraordinary but a good beer for sessioning at the bar or in the backyard."
Popular,All Day IPA,3.81,"Sweet floral and citrus on the pour, medium sharp tang on the tongue that settles into a slightly-bitter pinewood taste. Subtle malt flavor in the background. A nice step up from an APA for the recent hops voyagers out there, and a decent ""all day"" for the rest of us."
Popular,Pumking,4.64,"Slightly hazy, translucent amber color with a creamy white head. Good retention and a little lacing.

Smells like a pumpkin pie scented candle. Sweet, buttery, biscuity, heavy vanilla notes, cinnamon and other spices.

The taste follows the nose. Sweet, heavy on vanilla cream and toasted bread/pie crust; cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice, and ginger tie it all together, and the spices balance out the rich vanilla and pie crust brown sugar sweetness.

The mouthfee is slick but not syrupy, medium-plus bodied, well carbonated, shockingly drinkable for its abv and sweetness.

I've never been a big fan of pumpkin ales, but this is still the best I've ever tried. Bravo. Liquid pumpkin pie."
Popular,Pumking,4.28,"The bottle is a bit boring.
The smell is explicitly pumpkin. Which is a good thing because that’s why I bought it.
The taste is also very pumpkin, but there’s a smooth butteriness in the aftertaste which is super nice.
The feel is also buttery smooth."

T---Pumpkin pie spices as in the nose, but also noteable pumpkin. This is what I want.

F---Medium/full bodied. Mild carbonation.

O---An excellent pumpkin beer."
Popular,Pumking,3.26,"Tasted artificial I didn't enjoy the after taste.
Normally I love a pumpkin beer but this one did not hit the right spice notes for me. probably would not buy again"
Popular,Pumking,4.68,"One of the beers I look forward to the most during this season. The look of the beer is what you would typically expect from the style. The nose on this beer is one of the best in pumpkin beer. It's vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie and an earthy maltiness. The flavors just explode as you drink it. The higher abv really helps bring out these flavors. If you haven't had this one, get it. You won't regret it."
Popular,Pumking,4,"This is reaching close to the max of what a pumpkin beer can achieve. The pumpkin taste is deep and natural. The mulling spices are quite nice. So if what you want is a pumpkin beer, then have a Pumking. It doesn’t surprise me at all that this is the most rated pumpkin beer on the site. If you don’t want a pumpkin beer why are you drinking it and giving this a low rating? For the style it’s great."
Popular,Pumking,3.91,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium orange color with a mild creamy white head. A strongly bubbling body. SRM of 11. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate and rich bready aromas upfront. There's bread, some smooth orange, and more bread malt. Some sweet potato and pumpkin with a slight pumpkin spice like a pumpkin candle on the finish.

Flavor: Strong bready flavors upfront. There's a pumpkin and sweet orange flavor in the middle, that turns into the pumpkin spice flavor. Finishes with a fall/autumn spice, and slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is smooth, bready, and a small bitter bite on the finish.

Overall: A pretty good and very drinkable pumpkin beer. I haven't had too many pumpkin spiced or pumpkin flavored beers, but this one was the best I've had. Sort of feels like an imperial hefeweizen, but instead of banana bread is flavored with pumpkin. The breadiness is there. There's canned pumpkin and orange. Also some pumpkin and fall spice. Well rounded and drinks well. (Final Rating: 3.91)"
Popular,Pumking,3.84,"TW////: I drank this in Mona from Genshin Impact cosplay

Look: Nice amber yellow with an orangey tint! Like if you ate a lot of carrots and then you peed! Foamy head dissipates fast but a thin layer remains.

Smell: Like fucking pumpkin pie bitch. Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and everything like a pumpkin spice candle, some apple pie smell, some how it smells like toasted crust too! really amazing.

Taste: It tastes like pumpkin pie spit in beer and yeah kinda disappointing. Good malty beer with some cinnamon and clove flavor, and maybe nutmeg?? very little alcohol taste. The smell was amazing and complex, and the beer itself, at least to me, doesn't really have much ""pumpkin"" flavor. I wouldn't be able to tell you it was pumpkin beer if I didn't know beforehand. Its not BAD, its just not pumpkin enough.

Feel: smooth, carbonated little bubbles, doesnt leave your mouth or throat dry.

Overall: This experience is not unlike being invited to a costume party and you work hard on a costume to wear to it, and turns out, you're the only one wearing a costume. Excited to go leading up to drinking it, but once I took a sip, was left kinda disappointed and ashamed. I STREAMED THIS! HOW DARE YOU EMBARASS ME INFRONT OF MY VIEWERS! I'LL GET MY REVENGE YOU BREWERS!!!!"

L: 3.75. Nice dark golden body. Lingering head. Moderate carbonation.

T: 3.75. Getting more of the pie crust than the spices and pumpkin. Still delicious.
F: 3.75. Slow goer due to the ABV. Thin to medium mouthfeel.

Popular,Pumking,3.75,"On tap.
Amber yellow. Great retention and lacing.
Smells is odd and almost off putting. Like wet cardboard.

S- Beautiful smell. Very warm and Halloween filled. Nice notes of clove, pumpkin spice, and oats.
T- Nice strong hit of Pumpkin Spice. Very inviting taste that is as smooth and warm as it smells.
M- Super smooth and easy like sunday mornnnnnnnnnning :)
O- Looks can be deceiving. While at first I saw a very simple and basic ale. I was instantly intoxicated by the aroma and the taste of this Fall classic. I see why this beer is ranked #7 of the best pumpkin beers out there."
Popular,Bigfoot,3.23,"Pretty bummed on this one. It’s like buying a ticket to see Babe Ruth play, but he was too hungover or in jail or something and not in the starting line up. Right from the start, I detected syrup in the aroma; and then what do you know? Leggo my Eggo - syrup on my palate too.

Well, you win some. You lose some. And right here I’m becoming ambivalent as it warms. Wait…

Yeah, not much. Still a big dollop of syrup in the aroma, but it has died down a bit in taste. Still nothing to call your mama about."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.16,"This beer is not meant as a session ale. I buy it once a year as a treat, and this year in 2022 it is exceptional! I get a clean head, with well balanced pine and tropical fruit for the body. The finish is bread flavors and a warming effect; this beer is complex in flavor and feel. I’d recommend this one for connoisseurs."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.49,"2016 bottle from the cellar - not going to lie - not sure I drank any of the 2016 fresh....
Pours a clear garnet, dark ruby colour with tawny beige head. A bit of sediment left in bottle.
Aroma of caramel malt, bread, date but despite age a strong hop burst is there - piney, resin, candied grapefruit peel.
Malty sweetness on the palate - burnt toffee, caramel, date and bread - quickly overcome by a barrage of hop flavours - resinous pine, candied citrus peel, grapefruit with a sticky bitterness coating the palate.
Full sticky mouthfeel, decent carbonation despite aged state with a lingering powerful bittersweetness.
Marvellous."

This year? This beer fucking stinks, on rye, like one reviewer noted, recently, Yes, I finished my one sixer, and just to be sure, wasted the $2.50 on one more single last night ... way too harsh, and plastic, fake, tasting. No balance and this will only got worse over time And while, the other legend Celebration Ale, was very good, it does NOT belong in cans. loses aroma."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.28,"2022 bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Brewing Co tulip glass

A: Pours gorgeous ruby copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a firm layer that hangs around for a bit and leaves plenty of nice lacing.

S: Rich toasty bready malt, toffee, dark and stone fruit, all countered with a strong hit of resinous pine and citrus rind.

T: Hops hit first, citrus, grapefruit and orange, resinous pine, followed by a mix of fruity notes, plum, fig, apricot, peach, cherry, and raisin, toasty bready malt, and toffee sweetness.

M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, just a hint of alcohol.

O: Didn't realize I hadn't logged this one until recently, even though I've had plenty of it before, so I figured I might a well grab a fresh bottle and enter in a baseline, then revisit with a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it drinks kinda like a mix of TIPA and hoppy American Strong Ale, in a good way. English Barleywines get the majority of the attention, but there's a reason this American style one has stayed around so long. (4.28)"
Popular,Bigfoot,4.57,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4. 2022 vintage. Poured into a cognac snifter.

L - A fantastic clear ruby, with a two-finger khaki head that doesn't die out. Lacing is excellent.
S - Super floral. Getting rosehip, grapefruit peel, pine tar, and red apple. A hint of ethanol on the nose.
T - Toffee, stone fruit, and pine resin. Juicy grapefruit, followed by a heavy black bread note. Finish is intense and pine-heavy. You really pick up the ABV on the latter half of the glass...
F - Full-bodied, with minimal carbonation. Filling. Warm. Heavy.
O - The king of Sierra Nevada's brews. Like the weathered father of an immature imperial IPA. Dense, intense, and titillating every sense, this one is for the fans. Highly recommend, and I'll be getting another bottle to age."

Popular,Bigfoot,4.22,"2021 version. Poured 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep caramel color with an off white head that falls to a cap. Very active carbonation rising up. Aroma is caramel and earthy hops mixed with a combination of dark fruit and citrus fruit. Taste is caramel, malty sweetness, resinous/earthy hops, and alcohol. Feel is thick and chewy with a nice carbonation bite. In the end there's a bit of dryness that sneaks in. There's a definite alcohol warmth with this. Overall, I don't have a lot of experience with barleywines, but I do like this and would buy again."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.77,"I first started drinking Bigfoot exactly 10 years ago, and every year, I buy several 6 packs and drink them periodically throughout the year. Today, I'm drinking the 2022 release on 2/5/22. It is outstanding, as usual. There was a ton of hop residue in the bottom of the bottle already, and I like my Bigfoot on the hoppy side, so I swished the last little bit around in the bottom of the bottle before I finished the pour. Pours a beautiful (and slightly hazy) dark cherry to copper hue with a beige head that falls down to an island with a ring around the rim of the glass. Smell is actually slightly mute this time around, but I can detect a slight caramel sweetness that blends well with a general, but faint, hop presence. The taste is definitely hop-forward, as I did swish the residue out of the bottle into my glass, but for me, that makes it perfectly balanced with its absolutely booming malt character. I believe that several hop varieties are used in the brewing of this beer, and the bitter aftertaste is absolutely there, but the malt flavor is so huge that it's hard to pinpoint any one flavor that stands out; it is amazingly well blended. Bitter-sweet medium-thick mouthfeel that finishes quite dry... the alcohol presence is very well hidden... Overall one of the best Bigfoot releases I've had yet!"
Popular,Bigfoot,4.22,"Long-time Bigfoot enthusiast. Generally you can expect a somewhat-sweet, quite malty version of an IPA, like an IPA that has had 40% of the water evaporated out of it. Generally, delicious!

2022's is harsher, as KT3418 has mentioned (although ""barleywine style"" is just a legal term for all barleywines...not an indication that it's not a real barleywine). The usual heat is just not balanced this year by enough syrupy sweetness. Disappointing but it's still one of the more awesome brews on the shelves."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.44,"Minimal head on a deep copper body. The aroma doesn't prepare for the taste, which is intense. A wonderfully bitter hop bite on a robust malt base, with a full mouthfeel. This will be great for cellaring!"
Popular,Bigfoot,3.91,"I poured a 12 oz. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot into a pint glass. A cream colored head emerged above a beautiful red amber body that was impressively carbonated. Profuse lacing rose above a head that receded but never entirely disappeared. I have never been more impressed by a beers' look! The magic faded on the nose, however. Nice raspberry and bread notes were offset by a pungent hops note, which overrode the more pleasant components. The taste was a bit more amenable to enjoyment... the sweetness expected from a barleywine is there, and lingers a bit, but after a minute without a sip, the hops reasserts and again controls your senses. There is a sense of quality to this brew... the taste, look and feel of it are assertive, and if you are a true hophead, you might be enchanted with Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. I prefer to enjoy a barleywine that celerates its' fruited and grain characteristics. This is not that beer. The mouthfeel is quite good, I anguished a bit, that perhaps it deserved a 4.5. Overall, the taste and smell kill it for me, but I like dark, sweet beers. There are simply too many hops in the mix here for me, but I do believe it is a quality brew that will be cherished by hops lovers."
Popular,Bigfoot,3.01,"The 2022 edition is absolutely awful fresh. Tastes like an extremely malt-forward IPA. None of us could stand this. Hope it's better next time or with age. Did not taste like a barleywine, can't help but notice they just say barleywine style. Maybe I need to wait 10 years before opening one."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.35,"Opaque amber with orange reflections, the foam is compact and fine ocher in color. Scent of caramel, biscuit, date, citric hops but mainly resinous. Sweet, softly and sweetly malty entry, generously bitter finish on resinous and fresh paths despite two years from bottling. Medium and round body with fine low intensity carbonation. Few elements elegantly linked together. Delight."
Popular,Bigfoot,4.6,"Beginning in 2005 I've enjoyed each year of this release. It is perfectly rich, sweet and hoppy with deeply caramelized malts, firm and creamy. It has the signature SN central axis of taste that illuminates throughout their beers. Now 2021, I can finally cellar some bottles to enjoy and age for a few years. A beautiful American Barleywine that is world-class in it's style.
UPDATE as of April 7, 2022:
2021 release 12oz bottle pkg dated 12/10/2020 into a pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly clouded ruby burnished copper w/a thin creamy khaki head that dissipates to creamy edge foam. No visible carbonation. No lacing.
S: Roasted malt, caramelized malts, light earthy hops, a hind of biscuit. Moderate alcohol as the beer warms.
T: Gentle sharp hop bitterness, roasted malts followed by dates, citrus rind, sweet/tart hops, caramelized malts again then deep pine resin that goes fairly broad on the tongue. It's firm & lengthy hop bitterness results in a long resinous linger.
F: Lightly crisp, bold, firm, medium bodied mouth feel w/a drying long lingering finish.
O: This annual American Barleywine release I have is 16 months cellared and has a radiant taste of sweet malts and pine resin hops. It's toastiness & bitterness are expertly blended and it is outstanding and or world-class in it's style.
*The 2022 release has a bit more of a head, the body is clear burnished copper, aroma has berries and is a bit more citrusy, the taste is quite similar though bitterness is at the front rather than in the finish, it's feel is slightly slick. Overall it is fantastic."

Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.17,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 5/26/22, into my spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a fluffy 2 finger head forms woth a good amount of fine carbonation rising from a light amber body with no haze. Very nice head retention on this one with just a half finger of head loss over the 5 minutes since I've poured. Head does become rocky but sticks around very nicely.

Aroma is more balanced than I remember with less hops jumping out at me than expected. The hops are surprisingly fruity with some tropical bright notes balanced by a nice sweet bready maltiness. Some slight fermentation sweetness is present on the nose but it's still quite a clean fermentation. Good but lighter aroma than expected.

Flavor carries some similar notes to the aroma, but loses a lot of the tropical vibes for a more traditional bittering hop flavor but there is a floral sweetness that merges very nicely with the very nice malty sweetness that this beer brings. The bitterness in this one comes after a the sweet hit on the front subsides but it remains a very balanced and quite sweet beer with some nice and present bitterness on the back.

The feel is easy drinking and refreshing while still letting you know it's there big body from the head retention and the malts even have a bready soft mouthfeel it seems. It's very balanced in this aspect as well.

Overall this beer honestly surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. The malty notes stood out while still maintaining a nice balanced hop presence. Quite a sweet beer which was honestly a bit of a surprise considering how similar this beer was to other IPAs it felt while drinking it in the past, but this is honestly an easy drinking beer that brings big but balanced flavor that I personally quite enjoy."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,3.77,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can I to a standard pint glass. Huge frothy “coke float” head on aggressive pour. Golden/light-amber clear color. Head dissipates slowly. Lacing is decent and a 1/4th finger head stays through half the drink before finishing with a film of bubbles.

S - Sweet malty scents. Some citrus scents as well. Light pine hops.

T - taste is more along the citrus and pine note. Slightly floral as well. Medium bitterness from the hops. Taste smooths out as you drink it and the malt characteristics return. It’s nice that some tastes are more hoppy while others are more malty.

F - Good frothy mouthfeel with decent carbonation.

O - This is a very solid everyday drinking beer. I’m not a hophead and prefer more malt-forward beers, so this carries a little more bitterness than I like, but it’s still a really good beer. The fact that the tastes go back and forth between malt and hop is an enjoyable experience. Would recommend."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.34,"This is a 12oz. can dumped into the Oskar Blues pint glass. This ale is a beautiful amber, very clear, with light but steady carbonation. one finger of white foam that hung around a lengthy time leaving thick lacing behind.
The aroma is maty from a distance, very noticeable, with the nose at the glass I get the pine aromas. Exactly what I hope for from a pale ale.
This ale is very pleasant, caramel, pine, and citrus. Sweet up front with a tangy, crisp finish.
The feel is smooth, light, and a bit fizzy.
This is an easy one to sample, but at 6.5% ABV it may sneak up on you after a few."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.44,"12oz can traded across the Pacific Ocean. Considering its journey, it's held up really well.

It's a burnished copper beer sitting in the glass with a thick, bright head that lingers throughout the glass.

Aroma is malty with strong, dank, piney hops. Very enticing!

Flavour is strongly bitter and caramel malty, with a citrus and piney hop body shining through. Finishes sweet, tangy and a little dry.

Mouthfeel is well carbonated and the tongue knows it's there, even after the swallow as the carbonic prickle lingers well after the swallow.

This is a great beer. I can imagine it would be awesome fresh at the source.

Cheers!"

Taste: Medium bitterness, grapefruit comes through, especially in the finish, taste lingers after swallowing
Feel: Decent mouthfeel, not too heavy and a good amount of carbonation, coats the mouth well
Overall: This is true to its style. Maybe a bit bitter for chugging on a hot day, but for sipping or mixing with foods that play off its fruitiness it would be ideal.
Pair with spicy foods, hard-wood grilled foods, BBQ sauce and aromatic cheeses like Stilton."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,3.84,19.2 oz can. Pours rich amber with a nice off white head and lots of small bubbles. On the nose you get the hops more than malt.

Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.25,"The iconic Dale's and its ugly ass can....an American classic Pale Ale now, and still a big one to get a good buzz. Not my favorite pale ale, but it is a good one, more like an old school ipa in some ways. Pretty good, but not the best. A good hot dog/ ballgame type of beer. bold malt and hop and stands the test of time"
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.64,"I had never tried Dale's Pale Ale until I moved to North Carolina only 14 miles from the Brevard brewery. I've seen it before, but the plain label made me think it was a generic pale ale. Boy, was I wrong. It's a 'hoppier' pale ale than I'm used to and, for me, is perfect as an everyday-anytime alternative to the heavier IPAs that I still love.

It's crisper than an average IPA and lighter."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,4.09,"So this was the last one of the IPA 16oz i tried from the local beer distributor. Why? Because of the plain label. I thought if they didn't put much time into the label, how good could it be. Well, it is actually better than alot of the others i tried. A little darker than the others, it is clean and crisp with a medium hop taste. Don't be fooled by the label like i was, worth trying."
Popular,Dale's Pale Ale,3.94,"Probably one of the more recognized names in the pale ale portfolio. Fairly priced and widely distributed so you're bound to run into it sooner or later.

Popular,Blue Moon Belgian White,2.46,"It's, by all definitions, a beer. A Belgian White beer, even. Looks like a Belgian White. Tastes like a Belgian White is supposed to taste. Cloudy appearance. Crisp. Delicate malt. Orange peel notes.
It's okay. It's a beer. Not bad at all. Easy on the way down. A little lacking in all its flavors. I find myself wishing for something more.
I buy it because it's everywhere, literally everywhere, usually inexpensive, and because for all it lacks as a drinking beer, it is more than adequate for deglazing caramelized onions (5s across the board to caramelized onions). And then, when I'm done making caramelized onions, I still have 5 bottles of Blue Moon left, and I drink them between my usual picks (which are not as good for caramelizing onions), and I don't complain about them. Decent beer. Drinkable."
Popular,Blue Moon Belgian White,5,"Blue Moon is definitely one of my favorite beers, very tasty. U can definitely taste the orange and it goes down easy. For some reason I like Blue Moon as a draft beer, I like how it looks in a beer mug and it just taste real fresh."
Popular,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.18,"Nice color and head as well as a good aroma for a Belgian white. The flavor, however, leaves more to be desired. Softly malty with just the slightest touch of clove and orange. Very summery and a decent introduction to the style, but I wish it were a bit more robust."
Popular,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.5,"Anyone who buys beer for social events knows that there are two choices: dirt cheap light beers that you drink not to enjoy, but to ""crush"", and higher quality inexpensive beers that still might not taste good, but leave your guests with the impression that you give at least half a damn about them. Blue Moon and its derivatives fall into the second category. This one, being the flagship beer of Blue Moon (read: Coors+), can be found in anywhere there is running water and electricity. I admit I've never smelled it because I don't want to be the guy at the party who freakin' smells a beer. The taste is mild wheat with a touch of sweetness. If I close my eyes and use my imagination I can make some citrus and spice appear. Not much besides breadiness, but it is a good breadiness. There is no industrial quality to it that you typically get from mass-produced beers. No complaints about the carbonation or mouthfeel. I might even say that I enjoyed it (a bit). Of all the wheat beers I've had, this is certainly one of them. It's hard to feel enthusiasm for a common wheat beer (it would be like getting excited over sliced bread), but for what it's worth, this is one of the better macrobrews."

Popular,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.45,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pilsner glass at around 55 degrees. Huge head on aggressive pour. Head slowly dissipates. No lacing to speak of. Hazy light golden color.

S - Citrus scent is font and center. I get a juicy scent as well. A little light grain malt. Sweetness on the back end.

T - Taste is much more subdued and less in-your-face citrus. The citrus scent is balanced out with the light hop flavors. Mild grain malts.

F - Mouthfeel is very good. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

O - Overall this is an enjoyable beer. It’s no wonder Blue Moon is so popular. To me this is one of the better beers for enjoying outdoors. Very refreshing, but has more to it than other macrobrews. I’ve somehow avoided this one for years, but I think this will be added to my summer and camping beer rotation."

F - Smooth. Oily on the finish. Medium-light body, with medium carbonation. Chewy. Easy-to-drink, and refreshing.
O - Not bad. Not the first time I've had this, either. This is probably the tastiest beer you could bring to a party and not look like a douche. A great lunch beer. It's everywhere beer is sold, too - so bonus points for that. I'll definitely buy this again, but I won't really go out of my way for this. It's my go-to for beer runs and BBQ parties."

Incredible value here if you can find it on sale. I paid less than a dollar-a-can, and for an impressive ~10% IPA that's no common feat. It drinks pretty good, just like budweiser, milluh, and what somma these otha' beers we got? But for real, it's smooth, overly hopped, pine and bitter and no taste of alcohol (just the burn in your gut) - or balance. Nothing outstanding here, just exceptionally well-done, solid, etc, insert your adjective here. Clear look, head that sticks around, doesn't smell like much besides hop pellets... Just buy this beer, it's worth it

Dangerously drinkable, indeed"
Popular,Double Jack,4.44,"There was a time the quality of a brew with the Firestone Walker label went unchallenged. Recently, there have been rumors heard that may no longer be true. This investigation begins by pouring two 12 oz. cans into a clear glass liter mug. A pretty pour it is. The color is a bright and nearly translucent copper. Well carbonated, a small enduring head is joined by good glass lacing and noticed. Not pungent, there is a soft aroma of malt and hops around the glass. Wonderfully drinkable, this does everything a great DIPA should. It's malt forward is velvety, slightly sweet, perfectly carbonated and earthy the way only barley can deliver. At the finish, the hops rule the taste. Nicely complex, they are a little fruity and mostly piney at the finish. There is a taste contribution from the alcohol that isn't distracting and belongs within a good American Double IPA. So much for rumors."
Popular,Double Jack,4.21,"Appearance: Clear and golden-hued, slim, off-white head, long-lasting.

Aroma: Dank and pungent. Wide open and fuming with fruity and floral aromatics, crackling with hop bitterness. Citric fruits aplenty, with tropical, as well. Stone fruit, too. Orange and lemon meet mango and apricot. Lovely stuff.

Let's drink! That cornucopia of the aroma is plump on the palate, with hop bitterness hanging in close on the side. Just about perfect. Several ounces in, and the booze rises up. It sits happily in the mouth, and causes no fuss, just the general happy feelings we associate it with. Ah, yes. And, yum, yum.

Beautiful fruit, beautiful booze, beautiful bitterness. Mmm, yes. Soft mouthfeel, brilliant hoppy texture, long finish. How many ways do I love this wonderful beer? How many ways are there?"

Aroma: Crushed pine needles, grapefruit rind, orange, sweetened strawberries, a little Cannabis, lemon, and malty notes that while present, hide quite well
Taste: Pine, citrus, berries, and dank come out swinging and all over top of a much more present sweet malt base, though make no mistake, hops are the standout frontrunner here. Near the finish, pine and citrus are again in the spotlight and closes with a great hop bite along with some sweetness
Mouthfeel: Big, full – almost viscous, a little slick, some alcohol heat, medium-high carbonation, and medium dryness on the finish
Overall: This is big, bold, and awesome stuff. A total throwback WCDIPA that is huge on pine and citrus along with being a full-feeling beer, has great dryness, and some booze heat that leaves no doubt it’s big. Fun to try this again after so many years of it being retired and nice to see [taste] it’s still a winner"

Popular,Double Jack,4.34,"L: This Beer poured an amber, copper color with a nice frothy egg-shell colored head. Bubbles floated quickly to the top consistently throughout my entire time drinking the 12 oz can.

S: The smells flowing from this beer were very green and pine-y. I detected hints of citrus such as orange in the scent, with a very slight tinge of booze. The smell was extremely appetizing and made me excited to sip it.

T: As far as double IPA’s go, this tasted great. There was a nice initial tinge of orange with a delicious malty and biscuity flavor flowing over the tongue afterwards. It finishes with a long bitterness that plays on the tongue afterwards for several minutes. Personally, I couldn’t taste much of the alcohol if at all.

F: Mouth feel was great. Very full and hardy with decent carbonation that wasn’t so extreme that it harmed the experience. It definitely felt fun and full in the mouth, but not so heavy that it might have creeped into a creamy territory.

O: Overall a delicious double IPA that I would definitely consider buying a pack of. With 9.5 abv it definitely packs a punch, but the flavors are there to back it up. Great showing by Firestone Walker."

If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on.

It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say.

On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast.

Overall, not as good as I hoped, roast a bit much for this palate."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.64,"Born 25 July, 2017. 12.9% ABV.
Top popped (53 degrees) with a whimpering sigh, got a nice coffee aroma right away. Almost zero head at all made for a full pour into my 12oz Avery Brewing snifter.
Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space.
The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat.
Mouthfeel is decadant! Little bit of carbonation lightened the usual BCBS heaviness.
Not overly syrupy too! Yay!
Overall - a remarkably smooth and excellent treat that stood up to 5 years of temperature controlled storage.
Damn fine Stout!"

Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.09,"2014 Vintage

Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.

Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.

Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.

Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.

Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.6,"Goose Island – Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout (BCBCS – 2014)

12.6% ABV

The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter.

First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5

Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25

Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25

Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70

Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75

Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65

BA Review Score: 4.56"
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.53,"Bottled 7/25/17, cracking this open just over 4 years later

Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out

Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs

This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry

The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat

This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!"
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.66,"2017 Vintage

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown

A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.

T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable.

M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.

O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.56,"2014 vintage poured into a pint glass.

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle.

Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.

Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.

Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.

Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base."
Popular,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.21,"2013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee

335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.

Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.

Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.

Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.

Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged."

Purchased from Goose recently, so I assume it was stored properly. It has none of the vegetable taste I have had in some older coffee BCS. This bottle is perfect. A wonderful balance of coffee bitterness and the sweet BCS barrel notes. I love the smell. There’s a lot of coffee here. Drinking it I get a lot of coffee too. I haven’t had a newer bottle in some time, and I know this beer has lost some of its mystique, but in 2014 it was still perfect."

Nose: Spicy, husky wheat and summer field golden grains. Spicy, herbal and fruity in the back.

Feel & Flavor: Very light and clean feel with a nice spice kick, herbal and soft with a tingle of light fruitiness.

Overall: I love that this is an American wheat bear sans the big Banana and Clove funkiness all over the place. This one represents clean wheat, grains and a herbal, slightly fruity hop thing that all jives together."
Popular,Oberon,1.8,"It can be quiet frustrating to drink a beer that feels like nothing. With Oberons in season, you're likely to find these things at graduation parties or summer barbeques. You can also find Two-Hearted Ale, Modelo, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Corona at these occasions. Now is Oberon really better than these? No. Is it really worse? Well it can't be worse Heinekein or a Stella."

Popular,Oberon,4.06,"I have been looking for this for a while. I only just randomly found it at a World Market, cool. Poured from a bottle into a spiegelau American Wheat Beer glass.

Looks - Hazy golden honey color. Beautiful look to it. The head is nice, white, and fluffy. The head doesn't die out easily. Lacing is kind of minimal. If you look up beer clip art, this kind of has a classic beer look. Very attractive.

Smells - Kind of tangy. Like, I would expect this beer to be tangy. Mildly fruity (pineapple?) with some malt in there. A slight bit of vegetal spice in there too.

Taste - Very nice. Not too bitter, not too sweet. Cherry-like notes with some lemon-esque pineapple. Mild spice and peppercorn fruits. Malt in the middle as well, wheat is very prominent and gives a classic beer taste while also being varied enough in notes. A zing of bitterness in the finish. Finish isn't too long.

Feel - Pretty smooth, fairly light. Easy drinking. Not very effervescent. Doesn't coat the mouth too much. Highly sessionable. Smooth, fairly velvety.

Overall, I enjoy this one. It's different from other hop-foward ales I'm used to drinking. Has a nice hop to malt balance. I've been searching for beers in the American Wheat Ale style. My only other exposure is Little Sumpin. There is contention around LIttle Sumpin being an IPA or an American Wheat Ale. I tend to be on the side of it being an American Wheat Ale...but trying this has me changing my mind. This is stylistically different enough. Not as bitter as other ales, but not too sweet. This would be great at family parties."

Popular,Speedway Stout,4.42,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a large, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and coffee and chocolate, as well as lighter dark fruit and hints of licorice and tobacco. Taste is an excellent balance of roasted, caramel malt and distinct coffe and dark chocolate, as well as some dark fruit, with notes of fig and plum, and hints of licorice, tobacco and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and tobacco lingerin in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and low/medium carbonation.

This makes for a very enjoyable coffee stout with distinct, but not overdone chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes, while I suspect that a lot of the chocolate and dark fruit comes from the coffee as well as the malts. At the same time, there's a very good roasted and bitter presence to this as well, with some roasted malts and herbal hops, which is just the kind of flavor profile that I'm looking for from a beer like this. It's very well-balanced, with some lightly sweet notes from the dark fruit and caramel malt, as well as more roasted malt and bitter, herbal hops, as well as hints of licorice and tobacco. Also, the ABV is hardly noticeable here, with this drinking very smooth, with a great body and mouthfeel."

And I like them that way (Roasted, Toasted, and bitter). And now they have this at my local Total Wine as well. Stouts are my favorite variety, and this goes near the top. They have a taco truck that stays outside the brewpub on some days. I have no idea, but something in this beer knocks me on my a$$. Great stuff!"

Feel: Medium bodied - not to much carbonation. Easy sipper to drink.
Overall: I loved it! I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as it was as usually coffee stouts are medium to coffee dominant. This one doesn't seem to be the case.

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut

It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee

But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.

I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees."

Popular,Parabola,4.6,"12 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew. Wish I would have bought more of this when I was able to, will definitely buy more the next time I can!"

Overall 5/5 . Drink fresh cuz only dimwitt would age this"
Popular,Parabola,4.59,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.

Appearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?

Smell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.

Taste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.

Mouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.

Overall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent."
Popular,Parabola,4.93,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up from liquor store for around $10-12. 2020 vintage No.11 printed on front label.

Appearance - Black opaque body with a small, brown, creamy one-finger head with decent to low retention, good lacing and stick. Head easily regenerates with a swirl. 4.75

Smell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75

Taste - Absolutely incredible. Flawless. Balanced. Bold up strong dark characters upfront but mellows out into a slow, rich, robust journey to a perfect aftertaste. 5

Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy. Warming. 5

Overall - No off characters whatsoever. 5"
Popular,Parabola,4.96,"There is depth to this that's pretty incredible.  I can smell licorice, bittersweet chocolate and musty whiskey barrel.

The taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor.

It has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness.

Wow, what a beer.  It's the most complex stout I've had but the flavors are never muddled; always clear.  I give it a 5.9 out of 6."
Popular,Parabola,4.51,"On tap at the brewery. Pours black with beige head. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, sherry, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, alcohol, herbal hops. Long almost dry finish. Delicious brew."
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.44,"Poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly.
The aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate.
The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed.
The feel was good, ideal even. Not sure if it could be better. Ideally viscous.
OA- very happy to have been able to try this finally!"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.97,If you've ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla. This beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste. Color is dark and consistency is very smooth. It's a shame I can't buy it in Texas.
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.43,Can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. Nose is vanilla and coffee for days. Taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. Vanilla lingers on the finish. Tasty.
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.21,"2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout."
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.37,"After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs

The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note

A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond

A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee

Damn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.87,"Yesss!
Well, you might hate it - or you might love it!
My wife didn’t like it but I did. Even though I’m not so fond of Porters or Stouts but THIS ONE, I’m telling you was really good!
Vanilla and coffee. Vanilla is really present in the aroma, sweet, but like some cookies or sweets or a kind of a cake? Very pleasant. And its taste is just as good as it smells!!! This isn’t always the case, as I’m sure you must have observed that beers often smell “better” than they taste - but this one was astounding. Sweet but not syrupy, sweet like vanilla sugar. Coffee? Not 100% sure I could decipher it, but maybe overall the thing tasted like drinking a Starbucks latte with vanilla added on top? Oh yes, don’t forget about its booziness, which isn’t harsh at all, rather makes the whole thing taste and feel like an Irish coffee.
This was the first that I had of this kind but it made me curious, I think I might seek more of such coffee or vanilla or oatmeal-infused Porters or Stouts out. Worth giving it a try!"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.79,"Initially: robust/strong taste. After several months of sampling Porters and Stouts, Victory at Sea sat AFRAID in the corner of the refrigerator...reattemped tonight; world class favorite!"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.02,"Smells like a starchy vanilla espresso. Tastes like one too almost, though the coffee is more pronounced and it almost has a dark chocolate taste. A good unique beer, though the smell is a bit too much for my preference."
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,3.99,"Notes from 2/25/2020.
On tap at the Draft House in Austin and served in a 5oz snifter.
The appearance is dark brown with a thin tan ring of foam around the rim. 3.75
The aroma is medium in strength and of delicious chocolate covered caramel, and a little salt. How can a beer smell this good?! 4.75
The taste is moderately strong with chocolate covered caramel, roasted malt, boose, and a moderately bitter finish. 3.75
The mouth feel is above medium in thickness with moderate carbonation. 3.75
Overall, it's very good but it's not quite my thing. I think it's how the bitterness mixes with the flavor. 3.75"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.83,"Ballast Point scores a home run with this big and bold imperial porter. The smell of vanilla greets you pleasantly and invitingly, not overpowering as your first sip brings you beautiful flavor notes of coffee and smoky marshmallow maltiness. This is an amazing porter- one of my favorites. Drinking this on a cold winter day - this beer is nearly perfect. I discovered this beer last year at a St. Patrick’s Day parade when I stopped at a local tavern and it made for a great day!"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,3.93,"Dark golden brown color with tan cap and lacing.

Aroma at first of something like coconut, quickly followed by a vanilla laced light coffee which reminds me of a Kenya bean rather than something more robust from some other part of the World. Very clean and pleasant.

Taste is more coffeeish than coconut with some elements of roasted malt yet it's restrained. Again coconut blends with vanilla but that's just my perception. That all sounds rather sweet but the brew doesn't come across as sweet in the taste as it does in the scent. It finishes clean and dry.

Medium texture with balancing carbonation.

Overall it's a refreshing take on the Porter/Stout style, very drinkable."
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.41,"Bottle from Albertson's. Wow, just wow. Black gold. Chocolate and coffee,slick and oily. Campfire, burnt toast and coffee. Molasses, yum....and the vanilla for a little bit of marshmallow"
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.5,"This is my first time trying this beer and it doesnt dissapoint. Very dark, i would have thought it to be a stout. The vanilla smells hits you instantly followed by coffee and some roasted malt. The taste follows the nose to a tee, with the vanilla hitting first then the cofffe and malts backing it up. All in all this is the best porter I've ever had."
Popular,Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.71,"Ignoring the recent sale of Ballast Point to Kings and Convicts brewery, this is A GREAT imperial Porter! Their brewer notes description are right on for this. Notes of vanilla... Not to sweet.... low acidity.... Coffee comes through..... All flavors balanced so well! From bottle, an early Christmas present from my DW!"
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.23,"On tap at Diamonds Billiards Cape Coral, Fl
Looks copperish, smell was nothing noteworthy. Taste was typical of an American lager, this too, not noteworthy. Feel was fine, slight carbonation. Overall, got this because the bar had lesser choices, Bud Light and the like. Not downing this, if it’s the only option, go for it."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.3,"A staple in early NY beer bars which was smart - one of the original cross-over beers for the fizzy yellow beer crowd.
The fact that it was ""local"" meaning close enough for NYers that they had some idea where PA was helped make it popular and that it was innocuous in terms of flavor didn't hurt, so the main reservation back then was "" it was a dark beer"". The horror!
Well, we have come a long way baby. And Yuengling continues to be both a staple every day beer for some and a ""corny"" cross-over beer for newbs.
Amber to reddish brown in color it pops a white head that falls quick and leaves little trace behind.
Aroma is corn flakes with a hint of honey - usually over carbonated so there is a gassy staleness on draft any way.
Flavor is mildly caramelly and faintly hoppy with a tiny bite of back end bitterness.
Finish is slightly sweet with a lingering soggy frosted flakes aftertaste.
It's East coast Fat Tire but been around a lot longer."
Popular,Traditional Lager,2.7,"Crystal clear. Minimal head with little lacing. With vigorous swirling the head livens up, fine bubble with a very creamy look. Still falls quickly.

Nose is estery, like fresh apples. Some roasty toast or mild biscuit, a bit of DMS. Pretty much the standard ""beer"" smell. Nothing offensive, nothing really nice.

Taste is a bit less pleasant. Mild and indistinct hoppiness. Esters are less apparent on the palate. Some oxidative quality, slightly stale and cardboardy. Some corny flavor, perhaps DMS. Moderate biscuity flavor in the mid palate, which is kind of nice. The finish is almost soapy, and a bit too sweet. Aftertaste is biscuit, floral (probably what I'm perceiving as soapy), and caramelly cardboard.

Mouthfeel is OK. Light and moderately refreshing, but a bit thin and watery. If the finish was dry, rather than cloying, then it would be much nicer.


It's mostly inoffensive. I'd probably rather have a Shiner or a Ziegenbock, if I'm going for this style of beer (and I can't say I ever am, outside of palate exploration). I wouldn't refuse one, at least."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.87,"Because America! Fuck yeah!

If you get a tingle in your balls when the national anthem plays, get goosebumps when you see the flag, or still get an erection when a bald eagle flies over…this beer is for you.

It’s not a perfect lager, but my friends, neither are we as a country. However, this lager represents a melting pot of freedom. An opportunity, in-spite of humble beginnings, to make anything of yourself. It represents an idea. An idea that in this great country you are free to drink anything you can dream of or brew it.

Happy Fourth of July Gentlemen, and God Bless America!"
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.05,"Yuengling Traditional Lager bottle at refrigerator temperature. Yuengling Traditional Lager looks good, and is one of a bunch of middle-of-the-road east coast ambers including Brooklyn Lager, Blue Point Toasted Lager. Traditional Lager is OK, but lacking in malt body. To me it is similar to Dos Equis Amber in style and quality. It's good enough in a pinch."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.19,"Highly preferred over the BMC ( and their light versions too.) . This beer has more malty flavor than other macro adjuncts and is very easy to drink. This beer is tasty and cheap enough to be a fridge filler , give to your visitors and not have to apologize for it. Most bars and restaurants have it too. Not much smell and a little thin, but it delivers some malty sweetness with only a hint of bitterness. A very solid beer."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.42,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Clear amber color with a foamy off-white head. Smells of sweet caramel malt and adjunct filler. Mildly sweet caramel malt carries through in the flavor but is accompanied by an unwelcome metallic aftertaste. Medium-light bodied. As far as mass-appeal beers go, you could do far worse."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.87,"Maybe i am late to the party but this a solid beer the color is nice , smell is ok taste is good i think for my Oklahoma standards, just got to get it from Texas for it. Sure in the hell beats Budwieser at least for me. Drink local have fun ."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.67,"While I enjoy expensive, unique beers as much as the next guy. I can’t lie when I say that when it’s super hot I go for a lager over a IPA/stout/etc. This beer is cheap, and it’s very very good for a lager. While it’s not the most amazing beer you can get, you can usually find a 6 pack for 10 or less and that’s commendable for how good this beer actually is

It tastes really subdued for a beer but not super subdued like Bud Light

Smell is alright, nothing special

Feel is nice, very refreshing

In a bottle it look ok, In a glass it’s a very nice color, almost no head though

One of my favorites"
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.53,"A beer everyone can agree on. It's extremely affordable (2 for $4 tallboys) and is more than passable: it's simply good. Standard beer taste, a little malty and sweet. Not watery, not skunky. Nice body and enjoyable, refreshing taste."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.92,This is a macro I truly enjoy drinking. I love its light malty sweetness and have always found it refreshing and very drinkable. I'll buy this any time I see it... which is very unoften due to distro area.

Doesn’t look or smell impressive, but delivers a decent approximation of a historical US lager.
Yeah, there’s some corn, it’s too sweet, and it should be livelier, but there’s some deep malts, real lager leanness and more than enough hops to clean it up.
For a wide distro supermarket $7-a-six-pack lager, this has far more character than you’re paying for.

Often the best option in craft-unfriendly places, and that’s fine."
Popular,Traditional Lager,3.08,"picked up a 32 oz, usually fresher in my area, as with alot of these mass produced beers... the big boy bottles tend to be fresher. had this on draft, in a can, in a bottle, too many times. average fizzy beer no lacing no head retention. def think they use porterine to color this one.

Edit: This beer can shine if poured right. if you do that classic numbskull no head to the tippy top pour, this is one of the most carbonated wet stale cardboard beers youll ever neck down. If you exude some testicular fortitude and confidence, youll direct pour the sumbitch right into your oversized 500 ml pilsner urquell mug, gettin a nice big ol spongey white head with plenty of lace. So the 32 OZ brown quart glass bottles carry the unspoiled malt flavor much better. the green bottle 12 oz is just more aesthetically pleasing, but i drink through the eyes of a blind man. what would this review be without the home row keys and that little bump underneath the f and j? htrhetureturehtrehjkghadlkfghirt. This score will reflect a direct pour from 32 oz brown glass, since im not a bartender and cant be pissed to ask the tender to do let her rip, let it sit, and come back to it in a few minutes for that slow pour german style. then again the poor girl is also trying to swat the barflies and fruit flies that you will absolutely see in any bar serving this classic baby on draft."
Popular,Milk Stout,4.58,"Look: It may just be me, but, I think stouts are always the best looking beers so it’s always gonna be a 5

Taste: Like a mocha coffee, sweet, this is one of the best tasting beers. But he warned, it’s very sweet

Feel: Lingers a bit too long imo, but still very nice

Overall: This is a damn good stout. I’m so glad my local liquor store has this. Highly recommend."
Popular,Milk Stout,4.07,"I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes, but still provided moderate lacing. The aroma is quite pleasant. chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, milk, and a vanilla-like sweetness prevail. The resultant effect bears a faint barrel-aged resemblance. The taste is about what you expect from the nose. The roasted barley blends well with moderate hops, and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. I expected a stickier consistency, but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing, compared to a typical stout. I find Left Hand Milk Stout a compelling choice among dark, sweet stouts on the market, and The 6% ABV is right on target for what I desired from this brew."
Popular,Milk Stout,4.5,"Nothing about the look and smell really stands out as a major pro or con. Where it excels is taste and feel as it really lends itself to my personal preferences. I don’t like overly fizzy beers and this stout is about as watery as they come, while still maintaining a coffee and milk flavor (tastes like a plain latte)."

Popular,Milk Stout,3.77,"I bought a glass bottle of this at my local liquor store and drank it from a shaker pint. I found it to be dry for a milk stout, which is generally fine by me as I'm not a huge fan of sweetness in beer. I thought it tasted more of fig than coffee or chocolate. I'd definitely drink it again."
Popular,Milk Stout,4,I prefer other American stouts but this at least met expectations and I'd absolutely have this again. The flavors are there I just know you can find them in other places more intensely. Definitely worth a try especially if new to the style
Popular,Milk Stout,3.75,"2. rerate, 355 ml bottle, as Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.0%. Black colour, low and creamy beige head. Dryish roasty aroma, notes of coffee, hints of woodwork, cocoa and liquorice. Low carbonation. Medium dry and very roasty flavour with a little lactose sweetness present, notes of strong coffee, a little dark chocolate and liquorice. Should not be drunk ice cold, cellar temperature is better. 1. rerate, 12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway (forgot that I had rated it previously). ABV was said to be 5.0%. Dark brown colour, nearly black, nice and lasting tan head. Notes of aroma: same as first time. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The flavour has still plenty of roasted malts and lactose sweetness, also notes of chocolate, mild coffee and some liquorice. Good stuff - I’m upping it a few points. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Dark brown to black colour. Nice roasty aroma, notes of cocoa, hints of liquorice. Moderately sweet flavour, plenty of maltiness (probably also lactose)."
Popular,Milk Stout,4.04,"12 oz bottle poured into a stout glass. Pours black, opaque with a tan head that falls to a cap. Smell is coffee, cocoa, roast malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, coffee and cream on entry. Middle is where sweet gets evened out as hop bitterness creeps in. You get a bit of earthiness from the hops too, but again, everything is well balanced. Finish is roast, nuts, and a bit of cocoa. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Low, tight carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer with a ton of flavor that drinks easy."
Popular,Milk Stout,3.85,"Appearance: Pours a nearly completely black color with a soft, tan head. SRM of 24. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of chocolate and cream upfront. There is also a velvety, cherry, and licorice note. Not much coffee or roast. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of velvety, rich chocolate, There are some underlying red velvet and red & black cherry notes here too. Mild roast and minimal coffee here. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Minimal bitterness and roast so allows it to lean malty. (3.75)

Compared to Firestone Walker's Nitro Merlin Milk Stout 1/10/21: Pours a similar color with a darker head. More cherry licorice on the aroma. Less coffee roast. Maybe slightly less bitterrness from the roast, but since it's not nitro doesn't feel as smooth. I mislabeled the two in a blind taste test.

Overall: A pretty nice and easy drinking milk stout. I get some hints of red velvet, cherry, licorice. But overall minimal coffee and roast here. Appropriate sweetness, but the minimal roast allows it to finish slightly malty and fairly easy-drinking at 6%. (Final Rating: 3.85, the flavor helps it here with the rich cherry-chocolate flavor)"
Popular,Union Jack IPA,4.3,"Dirty gold in color, clear with slight chill haze that goes away, white head with nice retention and some lace.

A slightly tropical big dose of orange citrus and rind, with a hefty dose of sappy pine.

Medium body, the hops bite you on the tongue, super resiny dry and crisp bite of high bitterness, like eating a pine needle.

This beer is west coast hop nirvana."

M - Prickly carbonation, slightly light weight, very, very clean finish.

O - Subtle, tasty IPA, well-designed and so very crisp and clean. Good stuff."
Popular,Union Jack IPA,4.32,"Pours copper color and creates a decent little white head. Nose is ignites the salivary glands at first inhale. Piney and citrusy fill the nostrils. Taste is not as bitter as I imagined, however there are hints of resinous goodness through the full taste profile. Very good IPA, but those words do not give it justice."
Popular,Union Jack IPA,3.84,"This is a typical West Coast IPA, that's for sure. I got more of the piney flavor than anything else, but there are a few different hops in here for sure. I didn't really get the mellow honey-like flavor that the description promised because of the amount of hops in there. If you like IPAs you'll surely like this one, but this is not my favorite style, so I tried it because I wanted to see if it was worth all the fuss. It's good, but not my thing."

F: A little too thick for my preference. Definitely resinous but I don't think it's as dry as others.
O: A solid beer. I think I prefer some of the other Jacks that FW makes, but if I'm really angling for a West Coast IPA it surely ranks among the best available in PA."

Popular,Union Jack IPA,4.25,"Poured into a Nonic.

Pours a slightly chill-hazed medium gold with a decent head and excellent lacing.

Quite a range of aromas. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, caramel malts meet floral, grassy, and piney aromas.

Definitely West Coast, yet still rather well balanced, thanks to a proper start. Caramel malt and honey-kissed graham cracker on the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to grapefruit bitterness, which evolves quickly into a resin-fest in the mid palate, before that surrenders to a more delicate, restrained floral/grassy bitterness at the finish that hints at the deceptive bitterness that comes from a wild clover honey.

Medium bodied, but well carbonated. Has a nice, relatively short and drying finish.

Firestone Walker is not available in the Dakotas, so glad to have grabbed some of this one while in Illinois. This is a badass WCIPA."

S: Orange, tangerine, pineapple, berries, sweet malt. Rather floral.
T: Hop forward. Tangerine, pineapple, pine, cedar, spicy hops, black tea, grassy light crackery malt. Moderate pine lingers in the finish though it is not intense.
F: Mouthfeel is clean, brisk and medium-full bodied and is mildly assertive. It is a little bit dry and has a medium-long finish.
O: Overall a very crisp, well balanced clean, hop-forward beer that drinks very easily and is quite accessible to a wide variety of palates. It has a bit of a bitter edge but is not over the top. It is excellent in it's style of West Coast IPAs."

Popular,Oatmeal Stout,5,"Absolutely superb. Poured into a pint glass at 52F. Pours the deepest dark cherry; almost black with a finger of khaki head which dissipates down to a ring with an island that sticks around. Smell is rich caramel and chocolate. Taste is caramel, chocolate, plum, with delicious creaminess. Somewhat dry and bitter finish that gives off coffee and toffee. This beer has some complex character with a low ABV. Great carbonation and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and the taste morphs and develops with each sip; the changes with temperature are epic and delightful! Couldn't ask for a better oatmeal stout! Highly recommend!"
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

The look it almost black when held up to light, only letting a little through and revealing its true dark brown nature. A one finger head forms, but it fades to a fine cap pretty quick. Lacing forms right off the bat however.

The smell is quite rich with a dark chocolate/coffee note, with some yeasty dried fruit notes as well. Sort of like Guinness but sweeter and more pungent. Has the signature ""sam Smith smell"" as well. Not sure what makes their beers so unique but all their dark Ales have that characteristic, but.its hard to decribe.

Taste follows the smell with malts being the main event here. Not very fruity in flavor until the aftertaste. Lots of coffee undertones as well. Beers flavor is not as sweet, but still has that sam Smith signature sweetness with it. One of my favorite stouts out there.

Feel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation bite to keep it balanced. Each sip is very smooth and almost velvety. Not super heavy though although it can seem that way at first.

Overall a delicious traditional oatmeal stout. Not americanized and really not hoppy at all, going more into roasty sweetness and focusing on mouthfeel and drinkability. Very good rich and malty."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,3.94,"Pours a deep and ruddy brown out of the bottle, resulting in an opaque body that borders on black when poured into a typical pint glass. A tight and creamy one finger thick head appears — over the next little while it collapses into a thick off-white cap that persists throughout. Thick lines of lace dot the glass throughout.

Wow, such delightful aromas of chocolate! For a stout that is not advertised as such, nor has any additives in that way, nor any ‘chocolate’ malts, it has a deep and rich cacao note on the nose. Caramel, toffee, moist cake aromas here as well, along with some toasted wheat. Very sweet character

Surprisingly silky smooth sip, the flavours following the nose but bringing out more of the oat character, which gives the beer a thicker body and a twang of bitterness. Though it is not as bitter as you might expect, not from any hop bitterness or any burnt/roasted malt bitterness. There is just a touch to balance out the sweetness. It is lighter than expected as well, which allows the sweetness to mix without being too cloying. Chocolate, roasted caramel malt flavours dominate here. There is a gentle dark fruit flavour such as dark cherries you may notice on some sips. Some coffee on the front of the tongue but it fades quickly.

Silky smooth body, the carbonation is lower and only gently pricks at your tongue, giving this a supremely smooth and creamy taste. It is medium bodied, lighter than you’d expect, and the finish is not as dry as advertised. A very gentle, subtle finish that leaves only a hint of chocolate, malt, and cacao beans in your mouth.

Surprised by this beer, I would say it’s more subtle than you’d think. For an oatmeal stout, it definitely goes for balance compared to many others. With all that said, if you expect a typical strong roasted/almost burnt malt taste with strong oatmeal character and an oily body with unique bitterness, you will be disappointed here. If you’re looking for an easy drinking stout, this is great. If you’re looking for a stout with chocolate flavours that isn’t overwhelming like some chocolate stouts or a chocolate stout without lactose, this is an excellent choice.

Overall it’s quite an excellent beer and absolutely has its place. I am glad I got two, as this is definitely an enjoyable beer you could knock more than a few back through the night."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,4.04,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent had roast malt notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and coffee presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,5,"As the label clearly states ""The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout""...

Poured a full four finger tan head right up to the rim of the pilsner glass. Very sweet malt notes on the nose, almost like a fresh bran muffin. Not quite as opaque and dark as the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter in the glass.

Just enough malt sweetness on the palate, like a really rich barley soup, full flavored without being overwhelming. Retains a little sweetness, whatever hops used are also light and sweet on the aftertaste. Perfect balanced flavor.

Body exactly right, slightly oily weight, not too thin not too heavy.

As close to a perfect Stout as I have ever had. Been revisiting old favorites and finding myself pleasantly surprised how well many have held up over the years. There's only a tiny handful of beers I give a perfect score to, and this is one of them. In fact, if I was forced to only have one brand and type of beer the rest of my life, I would choose this one. Richer and sweeter than Guinness, this one stout ticks all the boxes for me. No negatives, all positives, right down to the ABV... It lingers on the palate, with the complexity of a good single malt scotch. If I haven't been clear I really really like this beer."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,3.89,"Quality beer that pours a dark brown with a thick head. After trying the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout, this one was a disappointment. A bitter hop flavor, it's not nearly as refreshing as the chocolate counterpart. I've had better Oatmeal Stouts, but you could do much worse. I'd probably never get it again at the price point"
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,3.6,"Deep dark brown body, rapidly forming a solid, thick, mocha head, fine and with great retention.
Fruity chocolate aroma - cassis, blackberry, black cherry - not so much roasty or rich, and even lightly floral.
The taste follows suit, with fruity cocoa notes of dark fruit, acidic, with a bittersweet tang of espresso; medium light body and carbonation, verging on watery, although the oats, a bit of residual sugars, and a powdery feel help give it some substance; the semi-dry finish is long, with more roasty chocolate coming through, but still accompanied by distinct fruitiness.

Not what I expected, one of the fruitier stouts I've tried, nevermind one that isn't deliberately incorporating fruit flavours, and lacking body. In the end, it's enjoyable, and probably more so if you know what to expect.
Edit - what I tasted is so far off other reviews, my batch is potentially off"
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,3.88,"I bought a bottle at the LCBO in Ontario 550ml at 5%. Poured a 2finger creamy head into pint glass.

Taste was very smooth and creamy oatmeal with a hint of toffee and coffee just sipping on it
Overall this oatmeal stout is very enjoyable to drink leaving a lace all the way down but it feels stronger then 5%
Good beer

Popular,Oatmeal Stout,4.52,"Looks like a stout should, and pours a nice thick tan head into a pint glass. Aromas are not as pronounced as some others maybe, but what is there very nice. The taste is excellent, with expected roasted malts beng the star. Nearly perfect balance and feel. One of the best stouts IMO, when you don't want any added fruits, coffee, etc. Perfect brew for a cool damp November evening. Every stout lover should know this world-class beer as a reference for the benchmark."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,5,"It's an absolute classic. Bubbling, thick and rocky tan head. Coffee and toffee on the nose. The palate carries strong notes of coffee and malted barley with grassy hop-bitterness in the background. Moreover, one can tell this stout was brewed with good water, and the result is incredibly drinkable. In my opinion this is a perfect beer."
Popular,Oatmeal Stout,4.64,Everything from Samuel Smith is excellent! This one is not exception. taste of Toffee/Caramel and Oats. What could go wrong.....smooth full bodied malty heaven.
Popular,Alpha King,4.07,"Look: It pours copper with an off white head. Head retention is excellent.

Smell: There are citrus aromas up front with some caramel. There are some pine notes in support with dried apricot notes.

Taste: It has a definitive malt presence with caramel and citrus. The balance is nearly even with a slight tilt towards the hops. In addition there are pine and dried apricots.

Feel: It has a medium body with strong bitterness in the finish without being harsh.

Overall, a very good pale ale that is slightly balanced towards the hops."
Popular,Alpha King,4.46,"No canned on date…
Appearance: Pours a dark orange copper, almost red in color. About a finger of white-yellow foam with good head retention and lacing down the glass. Translucent, but I think that is a more due to the color, there isn’t any floating sediment.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and bready caramel malts with a subtle sweetness. Notes of apricot and tangerine are also present. Prevailing sweetness is present from the middle to the back with caramel, rye bread, and slight toffee malts.

Taste: Bitter hops on the front end with pine, grapefruit, and orange rind that adds to the prevailing sweetness. I also get hints of apricot, tangerine, pineapple, and maybe some mango. Caramel and bready malt profile provides a solid back bone with a bit of rye spiciness on the back end.

Feel: Medium carbonation gives the smooth mouth feel and enhances the malt profile and flavors. Thicker than I remember and maybe that is because it is slightly older. Minimal alcohol warmness and overall enjoyable.

Overall: I think this beer is a bit on the older side, but certainly hasn’t gone bad. Malt flavors are a bit more pronounced, and the edge of the hops is taken off slightly but still enjoyable. Classic beer with great hops and beautiful supporting malt backbone. Always happy to enjoy this beer and I will definitely keep buying it."

Smells of slightly dank piney grassy hops with some citrus.

Tastes of hops and malt first followed by slightly tart citrus with a slightly bitter finish.

Medium light body with light prickly carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.

This hoppy ale could be considered to be a slightly lighter West Coast IPA. Very drinkable and well made."
Popular,Alpha King,4.26,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Copper in color, transparent, small but foamy head with decent lacing retention.

Smell - a balance of dried fruits, malts, and some sweet/syrupy notes. some hops also present, mostly pine and a bit of citrus. this is a complex one.

Taste - the taste is as complex as the smell. hop forward, but only moderately so. smoothed out by a wave of malts and syrup like sweetness. the hops come back in the end and leaves behind a long and slightly sweet finish - the kind typical of an exemplary IPA or hoppy ale.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderate in ABV at 6.66%.

Overall - for a flagship beer, this is remarkably complex and pretty damn tasty."

Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.43,"8/10/22 Really nice Russian Imperial Stout. Perfectly balanced between chocolate, coffee, malt. Sweet but not cloying. Better than Ten Fidy? This could be the one."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.15,"Happy to try an east coast classic. Smell is sweet, lots of vanilla, some maple syrup, a bit of coffee, and a slight bourbon character. Taste follows- sweet and rich. Toasted malt dominates. Caramel, marshmallow, some piney hoppiness, bitter dark chocolate, and nutty coffee on the finish. Smooth drinking, and I can taste the alcohol. It lives up."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.41,"Pours black with a nice tan head with some lacing on the surface throughout. Smell is roasted malt with some chocolate notes. The beer delivers on its black chocolate promise but without becoming cloying or gimmicky. The first few sips have a big spicy alcohol hit before it settles in and you get used to it. Nicely balanced between bitterness from the roasted malt, some underlying sweetness, with that black chocolate note throughout. Heavy and boozy although it's tasty enough to have a couple."

Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.43,"Poured black with a fizzy dark tan head that dissipated quickly to a thin film. Light lacing. Nose of light molasses, malt and dark chocolate. Initial taste of sweet malt and then an explosion of flavor from burnt toast, dark chocolate, oak and bitter black licorice lingering on the finish. This is a huge taste bomb with various layers. The high ABV is somewhat hidden. Moderate-light body with fine carbonation. Slightly slick with a lingering stickiness on the lips. Although I expected a slightly thicker brew, the overall feel is quite good. Sip this slowly and roll it around on the tongue to get the best experience. I would definitely buy this again."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.09,"Again, after many years, I try this brew. From the bottle, it pours a stygian dark black color with a nice light brown head that reduces and leaves lacing. Roasted and burnt malts in the nose. The mouth follows the nose, with some bitter chocolate as well."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.06,"Crisp, bitter, wouldn’t guess 10%, unlike many stouts at this level which ooze alcohol as well as adjuncts- none of those in this, relatively mild taste of chocolate and bitterness, coffee etc. very drinkable, for a rich 10% imperial stout. Really great, good for winter."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.54,"Appearance:
A full, two fingers of creamed froth the color of burnished beige that laces in slippery webs. This voluptuous head retains only a few moments before being swallowed up by the glossy blackness below.

Bouquet:
Smoked barley and charred baker’s chocolate are engulfed in a tremendous whirlpool of dark malts. As it airs, the barley and malts take a backseat as tremendous dark chocolate emerges from its charry cocoon, bold and unmitigated.

Feel:
The very definition of a stout: dense and full-bodied. Carbonation shows restraint, content with becoming lost in a warm, boozy, woodsmoke linger.

Taste:
Copious quantities of scrumptious, bitter black chocolate, subsumed by an avalanche of booze-drenched dark grains and black bread suffused with charcoal smoke."
Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.13,"Its an almost oozing thick dark ale on the border of jet black, with a warmly tinted head.

Popular,Black Chocolate Stout,4.37,"2020 edition.
Pours black with small tan head, left no lacing and faded fast.
Smells really inviting. Nice dark chocolate with tons of roasted notes and some light vanilla sweetness.
Taste follows the nose. This is an awesome flavour profile. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, some coffee on the back, and 0 alcohol so this one’s a bit dangerous.
The mouthfeel is sadly kind of thin. Not super full bodied like what I expected for a big stout but it doesn’t ruin the experience. Carbonation is light and the finish is smooth and dry.

Overall, this is a really cool beer and I’m glad I got to try it. It’s balanced very well."

Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.23,"Appearance: Pours a mildly clear (40% clarity), dark amber to brown color with a strong tan head. SRM of 19.

Aroma: Initially, strong bready aromas stand out upfront. Among them some chocolate notes. Hints of licorice, dark fruit, and caramel to support.

Flavor: Strong flavors of dark bread upfront. A strong dark bread yeast is present that gives a bit of bubblegum and bread spice. After this, getting more licorice, roasted black malt before a chocolate and caramel sweet malt finish off the end.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is malty, but relatively dry for the ABV. A bread spice and chocolate flavor linger.

Overall: A fantastic doppelbock. Honestly I haven't had a doppelbock that wasn't fanatastic. This one nails the flavors and probably leans more bready than the others, but hard to tell. Exactly what a doppelbock should be. Should probably compare to others to see if this one is truly better. (Rating: 4.23)"

Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.42,On tap in Wisconsin. Just what I want in this style. Very smooth and drinkable with some sneaky alcohol. Went great with my meal. Had this a couple times and will choose it again.
Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.33,"Very dark, opaque, almost black, with a garnet tinge around the edges, and two fingers of light brown head that dissipates quickly - to be expected given the 6.7% ABV. The smell is rich and powerfully malty, with sweet dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, and beef broth. The taste mostly follows the nose, but is not quite as strong, which I found slightly disappointing, but at the same time makes this beer more drinkable - almost dangerously so. The warming spirit alcohol is noticeable but unobtrusive, and wouldn't slow you down all that much from necking this stuff if you didn't know better. Overall an intense, complex, rewarding beer -in other words, par for the course for a Doppelbock, and another home run from Ayinger."
Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.94,"Pours deep ruby with an enormous khaki head, which sticks around, and leaves quite a bit of lacing all the way down to the bottom.

Rich malty goodness on the nose. Almost a bit like beef consomme as well, which actually follows through on the palate. Good fresh baked brown bread.

Entry is semisweet, complex. The malt, the brown bread, that faintly meaty beefy note I always associate with bock style.

Feels good and heavy, just this side of overpowering I would say. Really stays with you, without that overhopped bitterness some bock, doppel or otherwise, can have. A real mouthfiller...

Overall this may be the ideal doppelbock, perfect expression of the style. I've been going back and reviewing a lot of old favorites, and I'm about to branch out into some of the more modern expressions, so I'm thinking of beers like this as setting the standard. This Ayinger has got a bit of a potent ABV, not so much as a Belgian ale or a modern IPA, but combined with that lingering aftertaste, makes for a pretty satisfying bottle. And I also think something should be said for the label, which may be the coolest label of any beer I can think of right now... Two goats (two goats get it?) rampantly celebrating a pretty large footed, dimpled glass of doppelbock... Truth in advertising! Putting this one up at the top rank with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as maybe the ideal expression of a variety.

As a side note, I'm old enough to remember when American Brewers like Pabst and Yuengling used to put out their seasonal spring bocks; in fact my grandfather used to bring a case or two of the Yuengling bock back in the trunk of his Galaxie, from our Easter trips to Pennsylvania, which was right around the time they seemed to release these beers back in the day. I remember the steel cans of Pabst Bock with the goats head on them..."
Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.24,"Pours very nicely, about an inch and a half head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Looks very nice in the glass! It’s almost black, like a deep blood red but more opaque than some ruby red beers (like Guinness, which is a bit clearer)

The smell is malty and coffee like, with a bit of fruit, reminds me of dried cherries covered in dark chocolate. Taste is very complex, smooth and malty at first, like toasty graham crackers but evolves over time into a mild spicy flavourful mix of mild fruits, raisins, caramel. Very savoury beer! The mouthfeel isn’t exceptional but by no means bad, it’s very smooth with low carbonation — I think I got an older bottle.

It tastes how you want a beer to taste when you hear it’s a world class, complex beer. Some folks say it doesn’t linger on the tongue, but my experience was completely opposite. An exceptional double bock, with the caveat that I’m just getting back into beer and haven’t had many double bocks, it’s excellent amongst all beers I’ve tried!"

Popular,Ayinger Celebrator,4.45,"The general consensus seems to be that this one is the best of the Doppelbochs and it's hard to dispute. From the first pour to the finish it is a first class treat. Clear, extra dark brown appearance and large tan head with moderate lacing. Complex aroma of cinnamon graham crackers, caramel, toasted malts and dark fruit.

Alright, time to knock out another style topper! This one is always being discussed on the forums, but I can never seem to find it near me. Luckily when I stopped in Half Time the other day, they had some relatively fresh bottles, so I knew I had to pick it up. Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses

It’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer. Finishes off dry

Popular,Punkin Ale,4.59,"Very much enjoyed this beer from Dogfish Head. It is bold with the pumpkin and cinnamon spices, but if you like those flavors, it is worth a try. I plan on making it a part of my fall rotation."
Popular,Punkin Ale,4.18,"Punkin Ale brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.00% This Pumpkin Beer pours out of a glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this brew is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold Pumpkin, Sweet, Spicy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Punkin Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the opportunity to. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a super nice job with this style of brew."

Popular,Punkin Ale,3.65,"This happened to be on tap at a local Cajun restaurant so I gave it a try. Poured into a shaker pint. Golden yellow color with some head and good curtain lacing.

Popular,Punkin Ale,4,The pumpkin binge rolls on through October. Dogfish is next up with their Pumkin Ale. A totally different approach to the category with no pumpkin sweetness and a strong bitter spice. It is very easy drinking and a lighter fall ale. Rating: 80
Popular,Punkin Ale,3.89,Tried this again this year (2022) and it left a much better impression on me. I like the brown ale base a lot and this time I didn't feel underwhelmed. It was still typical of other pumpkin beers but I'd get this again for sure
Popular,Punkin Ale,3.49,"Appearance:
Pure, translucent amber with a finger of off-white fizz that bolts quicker than a politician faced with a lie detector.

Bouquet:
Stale gourd husk with a cinnamon stick lodged up its buttocks far enough to be considered “distant.” The sad introduction is a forgivable offense because, as it airs, it exudes a mild aroma of sweet yams baked in butter and warming, fall spices.

Feel:
A slick yet girthy medium distinguished by fine, champagne bubbles and a comfy, long-lingered, pumpkin finish.

Taste:
Like being lured into a cozy, life-sized gingerbread house by the scent of fresh pumpkin pie… only to be knocked senseless by a cannibal witch with a tire iron: Starts with pumpkin pie filling on a gingerbread pie crust that’s abruptly interrupted by a savagely acrid, burnt copper aftertaste. This unwanted assault slowly desists as the beer airs but d@mned if it ain’t a horrible first impression… blegh.

Overall:
Let it breathe or pay the price. Don't wait too long though, gotta drink it while its still cold. Very nice once those harsh introductions are over."
Popular,Punkin Ale,4.25,"Smells a lot like pumpkin spice and it's malty sweet.  There does seem to be the herbal bite of hops in there too.
It starts a little bitter.  Then the sweetness comes, it's mellow and squashy.

The mouthfeel is thin and there's plenty of carbonation.  The finish is where it really feels like Fall.  Pumpkin and warming spices.

This is so good.  It's balanced, subtle and nuanced.  I give it a 5.1 out of 6."
Popular,Punkin Ale,3.9,"12oz bottle. Bottom neck is stamped for best by date of 'Jan 2022',

Aroma of toasted malts layered with pumpkin spices and brown sugar.
Taste is a well balanced blend of toasted malts, brown sugar and pumpkin spices. Gives off a gourd vibe.
Medium mouth feel. Good, supportive carbonation.
Very pleasant tasting fall seasonal with reminders of pumpkin with its spices, brown sugar, and a backbone of malts."
Popular,Punkin Ale,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Appearance is a dark copper or amber color, with more than a finger's worth of head, decent retention and lacing.

Aroma: pumpkin, cinnamon, brown sugar, toasted malts, nuts, nutmeg, spices/allspice, and clove.

Pumpkin is the most notable note while the nuts, malts, and nutmeg provide a backbone with the sweetness of the cinnamon and brown sugar. Body is medium-light."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,3.68,"Pours nicely, decent head that stuck around a bit. Color is rather thin and see through. Smooth, easy to drink.

Good beer, adequate for the price and style, but nothing special."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.52,"A classic of the style. Roasty, with lots of coffee and dark chocolate notes. Hits the spots and then some. That's what makes it a classic of the style."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"A pretty solid example of a Porter, but there's something amiss that I can't pinpoint that without this would be top notch.
It may be a bit heavy on the black malt, too much hops?
Not sure.
Still, better than most out there.
I'll stick to my Yuengling Porter. Easier drinking."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"Look: It pours very dark brown with a tan head. Head retention is very good.

Smell: It has chocolate aromas with some roast and coffee notes.

Taste: It has roasted and coffee flavors up front with chocolate notes mixed it. There is a bit of sweetness to it.

Feel: It have a medium body with a bitter finish.

Overall, this is a simple beer with flavors, but they work incredibly well together."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.03,"Beautiful deep dark and clear brown, a dense light brown head that persists; great lacing.

Nose has subtle dark cherry note, some cocoa and weak coffee, woody smell.

Taste has the same dark fruit twang, bitter dark chocolate; nice roast and almost smokey note lingers in the after taste.

Medium body, soft smooth carbonation, nice roast driven bitterness, dry finish."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.17,"The most noticable thing about this to me is the complexity in the flavor. Immediately it gives a lot of coffee and roasted flavors, and it lasts with a strong lingering bitterness. In some ways it almost tastes more bitter than a lot of IPAs owing to the burnt character. Very tasty."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.75,"Might be some recency bias but this is easily the best porter I've had since Capella by Ecliptic, to name one. Super dark, basically opaque but not all the way, delicious robust malty flavor. This lived up to my expectation"

L: Very dark, almost stout-colored, with smallish/moderate head.

S: Roasty, a little bit of coffee note.

This is a classic Porter. Good across the board."
Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.28,"Close to black with a dark brown head. Roasty aroma, and the taste is roasty malts for miles, a little touch of sourness on the top and a lasting bitterness on the back. Medium body, decently creamy mouthfeel. Very good for a porter you can find anywhere."

Popular,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"From the bottle into an 8oz drinking glass. Look is stout-like, dark porter. Smell is mild, light coffee stout but with something benevolently evasive. Flan? Taste is sweeter than a pale ale but with some hoppy-happyness. Feel is very smooth, silky. Overall, takes a second glance - kind of eases into you like the shortish female with the good personailty, without big curves, not obnoxious but bright, who people are not paying all that much attention to and then later, away from the noise, you realize she is maybe the most attractive woman, with incredibly complimentary features, you have seen in months, if not years.

T: Raisins, figs, dark soda bread, a fair amount of bitter dark chocolate, dark toasted malts, light char, light citrus zest at the top of the palate.
F: This superior tasting porter retains a brisk, fresh, soft medium bodied mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. It's right in the middle and has a beautiful texture that is luxurious. It is lightly drying.
O: Extremely well balanced and crafted, full flavored and facilitating with tangible earth flavors. This American Porter is agreeably world-class in it's style."
Popular,Budweiser,2.94,"Budweiser is a solid American lager. For what it is - a crisp, light, simple beer, it’s excellent. The consistency of their production is obviously incredible, and in the right setting (a hot summer day, or in the evening in a buzzing pub while watching the game) there are few things that can stand up to this classic. It’s best enjoyed cold and fresh, with its natural carbonation and mild beechwood finish and glorious light gold color and mild head. Folks complaining that it’s not like their good ol’ German beer or hazy mega-juice buttsmacker IPA aren’t wrong that it’s not a beer with a heavy body or distinct taste palate. But that’s missing the point of this beer completely. I’ve always got a fresh pack in the garage fridge."
Popular,Budweiser,1.6,"I found a bottle of Budweiser in somebody's refrigerator.
Look: Budweiser had significant foam from what I could see.
Smell: Budwieser had the hazy pungent aroma of corn mixed with industrial chemicals.
Taste: Budweiser had a sweet corn flavour with heavy hints of industrial chemicals. There was a mysterious bitterness within the aftertaste of the Budweiser I drank.
Feel: After I drank the Budweiser, I felt like I was drinking industrial chemicals mixed into a corn flavoured soda. I got scared that I would have a tummy ache.
Overall: I cannot recommend Budweiser to anybody."
Popular,Budweiser,2.2,"It really shows just how bad Americans taste is when Budweiser is one of the top selling beers in the country. Compare Budweiser with those from Canada, Germany, and Ireland, just to name a few, and Budweiser doesn't hold a candle to them.
Budweiser is a really, really sad commentary of a lager. That's why I drink German beer."
Popular,Budweiser,2.92,"Pours a very clear and pale yellow color with a white head. It has the taste of a decent beer when you drink one ice cold and paired with food like pizza, burgers, and Bar-B-Q. Haven't had one in a couple of years, but I still like it."
Popular,Budweiser,4.33,"Budweiser goes good with almost any food, tacos, hamburgers, hotdogs, and is a good beverage to drink while hanging out with friends and watching sports."
Popular,Budweiser,4.78,"Just a good and inexpensive traditional American lager that the snobs hate but everyone drinks and likes.
Its consistent and refreshing on hot summer day."
Popular,Budweiser,1.59,"Last beer I reviewed was an exquisite, delicate Pilsner that paired insanely well with a good pizza. The boys over at Weihenstephaner sure know how to do the right balance of complex and nuanced flavors, along with a nice delicate, simple beer that is worthy of their brand.

With my reviews, I've mostly been doing beers I love or like, so my reviews are skewed in that way, but today I review a beer that I feel isn't all that great, and that's Anheuser-Busch's beer, Budweiser.

COLOR:

Light and clear golden color. It does look pretty good when poured right. The head fizzles out and dies though, which should be an indication of what I should expect.

AROMA:

Smells tart and cheap. I got a weird, funky skunk smell. Just smells bad.

BODY AND PALATE:

It has the memory of a lager. All of the classic flavors are there, they're just incredibly thinned out. This tastes as if you wanted a beer and somebody shouted the classic lager flavor profile from another room. It tastes cheap.

Add some corn syrup taste and feel to this and you basically have a Budweiser. I love me a good Pilsner and a nice, refreshing lager, but this is definitely not the King of the Beers. More like a serf.

FINISH:

The finish isn't too bad, and not out of the ordinary for a typical lager finish. And I guess that's sorta the problem, isn't it? Nothing really stands out and intrigues your palate.

CONCLUSION:

This is nothing but dorm room beer. It's cheap, it's readily available, and for playing drinking games it has its place. But now that I'm 32 years old, I'm not after quantity, I want a nice, quality beer, and this beer just tastes like water to me.

This beer basically took those classic and delicate flavors of pale lagers and Pilsners that people love, and thinned them out, because they're after mass production and not a nice, refreshing, quality beer at the end of the day.

Overall, it gets a 2.5/10 for me. It tastes like the MEMORY of a lager or Pilsner, and is only good if you've just reached drinking age, you don't have a lot of money, and all you give a shit about is getting shit-hammered."
Popular,Budweiser,4.35,"""Best by 10/6/22""; drank 7/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice off-white head; strong, frothy lace.

Sweet corn, fresh bread & faint strawberry (?!) notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, mild raspberry & faint caramel flavors.

I'm stunned by how much I enjoyed this; my beer budget is about to plummet!!"
Popular,Budweiser,3.43,"It’s hot dogs and brats on the grill, fireworks and a Bud!

I assume I’ve had a Bud before, but the last time was at least 40 years ago (probably longer). And I have no specific memory of it amongst a sea of similar beers.

The 4th of July seemed to me to be as good a time as any to give it a proper tasting.

I reduced the temp of my smaller beer ‘fridge specifically for this beer. The ‘fridge was at about 38°F when I removed the beer. The beer was at about 40° when I started tasting.

Clear, pale yellow, lightly carbonated body topped with a tall white head, thick and creamy-looking with retention on the short side of moderate. Nice looking for the style.

Pleasant, if weak, aroma. Malty with hints of sweetness. No complexity, but still nice.

Light flavor of malts. Smooth in the beginning, and remaining such throughout. Some (but very little) bittering appears in the late middle and carries through to the finish. As with the aroma, no complexity, but still enjoyable. The aftertaste is mild and lightly malty with slight bittering. The overall taste is just a little on the sweet side. The finish and aftertaste are more malty than crisp, ending, again, just on the sweet side. (The slight sweetness of Budweiser is apparently one of the differentiating factors – according to other reviews – from the other top-selling AALs, but I like it.)

The mouth feel is thin, decent carbonation feel, and surprisingly creamy (in a light sort of way).

Overall, I am surprised that I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In flavor and in body, it certainly beats the heck out of the plethora of light/Lite® brands from these macro brewers.

One additional comment: unlike some other macro lagers – and even some non-macro lighter lagers, this beer does not develop off-flavors as it warms. It remains pretty much as it started.

NB: The following rating is with style in mind, but it also is a fair reflection of my enjoyment of this beer. Imagine that. I think I'll crack a second!"
Popular,Budweiser,3.74,"Bud was the very first beer my friend gave me, years ago. It was warm and probably past it’s expiration. I didn’t even finish it before throwing up. Didn’t drink beer again for over a decade and a half. Now I know what I like and enjoy exploring different beers and saw the tall-boy cans of Budweiser for sale on the 4th of July with the word “FREEDOM” inscribed on the front. I decided I should revisit this for the sake of knowing what it actually tastes like. Surprise! -it’s not as horrible as the beer aficionados claim. Neutral flavor of very mild hops, malt, and sweetness from the rice. No off-putting flavors or aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. It’s not something that one drinks to contemplate life’s mysteries, but maybe just to stare into a camp fire or watch the stars. It’s good enough to cool you from the heat of your bbq grill. I will say that I had some *ahem* bathroom problems later that I can’t help but attribute to this beer… but overall I cannot bring myself to look down on Budweiser any longer."
Popular,Budweiser,5,"Picked up a case of bud cans today. Maybe it’s the special summer “freedom” marketing that gets me, I don’t know. This beer pours perfectly, golden with a glorious white head. Smell and taste are slightly crisp like green apple cider, not too heavy, not too sweet. It goes down smooth and I actively want to chug it. This is a Beer I long ago dismissed but now I think I might just be a bud man like my father was."
Popular,Budweiser,3.14,"I just had to write this.I am an IPA fanboy who hits all the taprooms around the city.I hopped on BeerAdvocate to read up on Budweiset.
I tried a Budweiser tallboy because 5% abv around a pool in the summer makes more sense than my 7.2% IPA.
It ain't that bad,geekheads.And you should know that because we ALL drank Bud at some point of our lives.It's not your local's pilsener/lager that costs twice as much,but it is a decent brewski for sitting with friends.And for all of you reviewers that keep talking about corn this and corn that...Bud uses rice,not corn, as the adjunct,so shut up already.I can't drink Busch because of that corn;Bud doesn't have that problem.
Bud has a neutral,but pleasant taste.Doesn't smell like much of anything.Goes down smooth and easy.
I prefer IPAs,but I am not ashamed to drink this.And neither should you be."

Popular,Budweiser,4.91,"Waaaaaaaaay too many beer snobs in here like they are reviewing a fine French wine. It's beer ffs. Get over yourselves. I ascribe to the German proverb that there are no bad beers....some are just better than others. I drink very high end stuff, and then I drink this. Beer Advocate peeps are obviously partial to IPAs. That's cool..I like them too, but I really get sick of them too and want something simple like Bud or a Naragansset. I don't know why I bother reading the reviews on here. Very predictable. If there were blind taste tests, the reviews would be different. Drink what you like. Cheers!"
Popular,Budweiser,2.65,"Poured from a 16oz can into my weizen glass. Best before 5-14-22

On the pour a giant head forms even on an average pour 3 plus fingers but it quickly recedes to just a ring of larger bubbles around the rim and a few pods of bubbles floating on top

Aroma is tart and largely smells of cheap lager. Some BO notes not great and not a lot of malt either just off. And this is still a month before the best before. Bad.

Taste follows the smell but brings notes of corn. Still mostly tart water fermentation character. Some buscuity malt aftertaste but that fades to the taste of popcorn kernels. No bitterness, just fermentation, BO and grain. Still not a lot of flavor though.

Feel is crisp and easy to put down with a lot of carbonation bite for the style this is perfectly acceptable. Not overly watery on the sip but it doesn't stick around long. Not the best.

Overall perfectly drinkable and pretty predictable. Seems like it moves quick everywhere so it's not too risky if you can deal with the standard off flavors. Certainly not a standout, and I wouldn't reccomend pouring this in a glass."
Popular,Budweiser,2.49,"Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.

Syrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.

I am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.

So, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!"
Popular,DirtWolf,4.02,"Golden, foggy body. Lacy head. Smell is pine, pineapple, moderately sweet, slightly floral and lemony. Taste is tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, dank pine, more floral notes, honey, and lemon. Pretty nice balance between the pine and the tropical sweetness, with a nice malty finish. The bottle has a BB date of feb 4, so maybe it’s not as crisp as a fresh one. Still, really a good beer."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.34,"Appearance: Crystal clear amber-gold, large white head, good lacing.
Aroma: Pilsner malt underpinning supports the fruity, resinous hops that follow.

Mouthfeel: Finishes with enough maltiness to keep things interesting and refreshing while still hop-centric.
Overall: Lingering and lasting, well carbonated, full bodied."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.43,"Rich orange color, decent head, strongly alcoholic, sweet malt base and - most importantly to me - an earthy, piney rush of flavor that balances out and eventually overwhelms the citrus and floral tastes that I find so unappealing in all but the very best IPAs.
I understand why many who appreciate the hazy and flowery side of aledom don't like it much, but it's just up my alley and is my go-to on weekend afternoons when I have no responsibilities."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.12,Bottle pour - deep golden honey color with thick white head leaving significant foamy/frosty lacing. Nose is earthy and floral with hints of citrus and pine. Taste follows with a malty backbone and lingering bitterness on a dryish finish.

Popular,DirtWolf,4.01,"Th beer is a pale straw color but with a decent white head. It is clear. On the nose, rose notes and bitter herbal notes are present. Maybe its the label art, but it smells like a pine forest. On the palate , it is nice a bitter. the same hops notes from before are present but with citrus as well. The malt is there an similar to white beard with some whole wheat flour mixed in. The hops dominate the taste though expect for the finish but before the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is foamy but the body isn't great. The bubbles aren't pointed. Overall, a good well hoped IPA."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.6,"It smells bright and hoppy with a bit more of an alcohol taste than your average IPA.

The taste is a little sweet up front with a little maltiness but it soon gives way to a strong hoppy grapefruit with subtle notes of orange, orange zest, orange spritz or orange oil, lemon, lemon juice, lemonade, pithy lemon rind, lemon peel, lemon zest, lemon oil, tangerine, citrus, tropical fruit including but not limited to pineapple, mango, star anise, kumquat, not coconut but guava, passion fruit, jackfruit, pomegranate, cherimoya, rambutan, persimmon, a lot of apples, I'm no apple expert but the kind of apples they use for pies also golden delicious, red delicious, granny Smith, pink lady, fuji, honeycrisp and other apples, apple peel, peaches, nectarine, kiwi, banana chips, crab apples which although aren't edible but you can taste them and spit them out, elements of graphite, barbed wire, quick drying cement, pine but not just any pine, Douglas fir, red pine, longleaf pine, Virginia pine, pine tar, pitch, sap, and possibly hops.

The mouthfeel is light with a lot of fizz. It finishes clean and bitter and follows the nose?

In all seriousness overall this is an exceptional IPA. Besides the smell the alcohol doesn't really come through. I give it a solid 5.5 out of 6."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.27,"Excellent clarity in a yellow-orange beer showcasing active carbonation that feeds a 2 finger pillowy stark white head. Layers of lace cling to the glass with each sip. Juicy pine, grapefruit, and resin highlight a well rounded aroma profile. Bold but not too aggressive, almost a savory hop profile. It's juicy up front, grapefruit and resinous in the middle and then it finishes with a zesty pine. There is a an aggressiveness to the finish and a lingering boldly hoppy aftertaste. The body stays on the lighter side, somehow making for an almost refreshing sip and making this as dangerously drinkable as it is sipable. Really good selection from Victory here."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.92,"Dank Dank Dank. Piney and very hoppy but it defines the term dank, and in a good way. Drink this one by itself. No food pairings just sip, swish, savor and swallow. After you appreciate all that then open another to wash down your Beef, Ribs , Mexican etc. It will stand up to them all. But you owe it to yourself to enjoy that first one by itself.
Best DIPA that is easy to find."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.16,"Clear, bright golden coloring, lush white, long-lasting head. Lookin' fine. That ain't no lie.

Aroma: honey-sweet, tropical fruit bitter. Citra? Mosaic? Another hot hop I haven't thought of? Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.

Taste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn't felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…

Dirt Wolf isn't a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell's HopSlam. It's a good formula that's proven popular. And easy to market: ""Can't find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam's too expensive? Try this, it's just as good!"" I almost wrote ""almost"", but, really, it's just as good.

Not a tongue-ripper, not a palate-destroyer, just a nice, hoppy pleaser, with an onset of alcohol. mmm, hmm."
Popular,DirtWolf,4.2,"I'm a local and it is my ""go-to "" IPA. Good citrus, nice smell of grapefruit, and a bit of pine but what I really like is the smooth mouthfeel. The 8.7% alcohol content is accurate and makes me feel ""comfortable"" after a glass but helps with the enjoyable experience. It is an excellent Imperial IPA."
Popular,Three Philosophers,3.98,"L - Poured from a 16 oz. can into an oversized wine glass. Pours a dark brown with reddish hue in the light. Has a tan one finger head. Head quickly dissipates to a ring. Had definite clear alcohol “legs.”

S - Scents start with light malts before dark fruits. Some booziness at 9.7% ABV. A little sugar scent.

T - The dark fruit and specifically cherry flavors are front and center. The alcohol is up front too. A little more bourbon like.

F - Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is cola-like.

O - Overall, this is a quality beer that I recommend trying out. It’s higher ABV is very apparent while drinking and for that reason I don’t think I’ll add it to my regular rotation. Also the cherry flavoring sounds good in theory, but I don’t prefer it in practice. I enjoy other straight-forward Belgian Quadrupels more than this one."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.68,"Opaque reddish brown (colorblind, so best guess) with plenty of sediment. Thick off-white head that dissipates quickly with no real lacing to speak of.

The aroma is rich, tend towards cherry, and dark dried fruits. Sugar, burnt sugar. Moist earth, loam, and wet wood. Cola. Phenolic spice. Buried in there is a creamy oatmeal like aroma, trending towards nutty (like steel cut oats with almond milk). There's also a bit of cocoa powder hanging around the edges.

Taste is faithful to the aroma, just bigger and more intense. It leans heavily toward cola, even having a similar lingering sweet bitterness. It's almost bourbon like (Knob Creek), but too chocolatey and bitter to do more than insinuate a connection. The finish is rather prune like, and slowly fades to a lingering bitterness of hops and cocoa powder. Alcohol is apparent, but in a pleasant way (again, like with a good bourbon). As it warms, you get more fermentation funk (in a good way), and malty sweetness.


There is a lot going on here. Each sip is different as it warms. It's like a journey in a glass, and it's well worth taking. Delicious beer."
Popular,Three Philosophers,5,"The pour and the head is spectacular and very aggressive (quite a head; don't over pour or you're sure to waste some). The aroma of that first pour, especially into a chilled/frozen standard beer glass, is not to be missed. Everything there on out is just as enjoyable right up until you have to decide: ""Shall I have another?"""
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.35,"Pours the typical plum color with a tan head, it looks like a quadruple or a strong ale. Smells like cinnamon, raisins, with a whiff of alcohol. Tastes like cinnamon, raisins, sugar, malty, with a little burn. Not quite as good as the Belgian standards but it’s a tasty beer and has it’s own personality, cheers!"
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.19,"Surprisingly (to me), the head is short and very short-lived, despite as vigorous a pour as I could manage in the small 250ml chalice. While it lasts (look quickly), the head is a light tan color and bubbly. It quickly shrinks into sparse islands (and, then, also fairly quickly, disappears altogether), leaving a tea-like appearance. Dark reddish-brown from the front becomes a hazy bright ruby with a backlight. Active carbonation (also short-lived, though) rises to cause the islands to swirl around a bit. The color is great looking. Unfortunately, that is all that is great about the look.

Nice aroma, strong at first (I picked it up as soon as I cracked the can) but becomes pretty weak once the head is gone. I had to swizzle it to get a good whiff. Dark fruit, sweet candy, cherries. (Since I could tease an nice aroma with a swizzle, I didn't penalize the ""smell"" rating due to the limitation of the head - that was taken care of in the ""look"" rating.)

The flavor is very nice. Dark fruit, of course, sweet sugary candy, cherries-slightly tart. Spicy - coriander, perhaps some clove. No bittering. The middle exposes a malty foundation lending some needed gravitas to the beer. The interplay of the flavors never actually blends, but they do play off of each other very nicely. This is an excellent-tasting sipping beer, with lots going on in the flavor to keep me interested. The alcohol comes through into the flavor at the ~⅓-point of the beer and lingers through the remaining time. The finish is - oddly - a blend of sweet and dry. The candy bringing the sweet, and the cherries bringing the tart-dry.

The body is thinner than I expected for such a strong beer, and the feel is flat despite the initially active carbonation (which, as I mentioned above, seems to have disappeared along with the head). The feel ends up being a bit annoying (that is, for a flavor that is so great, there is a feel is so meh).

Overall, this beer might have among the widest variation among my rating of the individual elements (3.25 to 4.5), but the ones that count the most are the highest, so overall, it ends up at a weighted rating of 4.19. But, somehow, a bit of a disappointing 4.19."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.74,Intro description is pretty accurate. Heavy on the dark dried fruit. Feel and head is abbey style. Not a go to beer but def worth indulging. Seems a good winter holiday selection.
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.08,"Hazy light brown body, with a fizzy head. Smell is deep and sweet; roasted malt, caramel, raspberry, pepper, hints of spice and esters, a bit of chocolate. Taste is also fairly sweet; immediately comes the spice, with coriander, and pepper; orange peel and citrus too, followed by a strong malty backbone. The kriek comes out on the finish, with cherry and raspberry that add a sweet balance to the upfront spice. Fairly high carbonation, and the ABV is quite noticeable. This is bigger than I expected, and while I very much enjoy the complexity it comes off a tad unbalanced."
Popular,Three Philosophers,3.94,"Three Philosophers pours a medium, cloudy brown beneath an off-white two finger head. Actual chocolate flakes do float about the bottom of the glass, the cherry ale lightens the color and eye appeal of this brew. Chocolate, cherry, almond and sugary notes create a parfum more admirable for complexity than actually enjoyable. The taste is perplexing. The chocolate and cherry flavors stand apart, rather than melding. Hops, malt, and an overbearing fruit sweetness collide to create a delicate, fussy, overthought delight, with a saccharin mouthfeel aftertaste, much like marzipan. I never understood the appeal of marzipan. Pretty much the same here. I get the mission, I sense quality ingredients. It just doesn't ring my bell."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.23,"As I scroll down the reviews, I see a lot of variation. This one's a dark amber, lots of sediment, which ain't a bad thing. Prune, cherry, and tang (not the orange juice) are noticeable first, then a sticky thickness. THEN the alcohol (again, not a bad thing. Notes of bread on the back channel. I had a 4-pack a while back and forgot to review, enjoyed it then and now. A lot like an unsweetened thick cider that's fermenting to alcohol instead of vinegar."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.32,"Appearance: Dark brown, tan colored mousse-like head, tight compact bubbles with excellent retention.

Aroma: Yeast forward, bubble gum is prominent. Caramel. Dark fruit.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol noted. Some chocolate notes mixed with caramel. Faint, mild cherry flavor. Dry start to finish.

Mouth-feel: Light to medium bodied, high carbonation.

Overall: Demonstrates quite a jarring bite between the higher ABV & high carbonation. Gets your attention. Label mentions cherries, but that's pretty well hidden in there. But, as you drink it, you start noticing the tart, sour finish. Highly effervescent. Visually, it promotes a lengthy, creamy looking head, more so than most beer styles. I'll admit, this beer is not my normal cup of tea. But, it's interesting and a nice change of pace. Not quite sure where it fits into my seasonal/regular beer routine. Well worth a shot."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.43,"I cannot believe Ive never reviewed this beer! I used to drink the 750 corked and caged bottles of this beer on the regular!
Tonight I have a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter.
The beer pours a rich mahogany color with deep garnet undertones when held up to the light. A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling.
Aroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point.
First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now.
Flavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV. Even with this bite, the drying finish encourages me to take another sip, which gets me to emptying my glass much to quickly.
QUite a nice beer that Im glad to have revisited. Definitely a classic and one I will gladly drink again."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.38,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Teku glass. Deep mahogany in color, fluffy white head, slowly receding. Watch that pour because this guy will get a little out of control. Scents of raisins, dates, prune juice and red wine. Flavors of baking spice, oak, brandy, dark cherries, prune, fig. It’s funny, I’ve been drinking 3 philosophers for years now but just realized I have never rated it. First time I’ve tried it from a can- no discernible difference from bottles but I also haven’t tried them head to head. I do appreciate the pint vs ~12 oz volume though- basically the same price between 4 cans and 4 bottles but going to have a nice buzz on by the time I’m done drinking a pint! Maybe the best Belgian style beer I’ve had from the US. I always like to pick up some of these when the weather starts getting cold and reminds me of decorating the Christmas tree."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.18,"For my money this is as good as an American Belgian style beer can get. I tried this for the first time about 10 years ago, somehow never reviewed. I saw it in the local gas station in Delhi NY, about 30 minutes from the brewery. I knew nothing about it, but it was the only craft beer available, so I bought a six pack (well truthfully I also bought a sixer by Saranac, but that is an entirely different story). Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much. When I poured the first bottle into a goblet, it had a billowing three finger frothy head and gorgeous brown color with ruby highlights. Next I discovered a pleasant cherry and malt aroma. Then I had the first sip, and I couldn’t believe my taste buds. Cherries, plums, raisins, molasses, a subtle bread-like yeast, and a nice malt backbone. I took another sip, and it was just as good. Somehow the beer I bought between the Miller and Bud at my crappy local gas station was clearly a world class beer. I had previously lived in Colorado, and enjoyed New Belgium, but this was better! These days Ommegang is nationally known because of its Game of Thrones beer. But 3 Philosophers is truly the one and only king of American made Quads."

Well, let's see if it grows on ya. It is robust. And sour, but not too sour, but it has a bad flavor I can't name. I do not like it.

August 20, 2021 - Second bottle much better. Whatever that bad taste was it didn't recur. So its not bad. The 9.7 ABV is quite noticeable, not in the flavor, but in the effect. So I must have gotten a skunky one before. I raised the score for taste and overall."
Popular,Three Philosophers,4.36,"Poured from a pint can into a pint mug

L - Clear amber in color. Substantial light tan head three-fingers thick which settles to a complete and persistent layer. Lacing is present thanks to the thick ring of foam along edges of the glass though the head is so thick it takes a while to display. Looks like a glass of honey.

S - The cherry aroma is at the forefront. Very strong and sweet. Malt of brown sugar/molasses on the backend. No hops to be found. Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.

T - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.

F - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this. Probably best to drink this one on its own. You won't have much room for food otherwise.

Ommegang really delivered on this one. Will definitely get it again."

Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!

Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast

Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt

A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness

T: this beer delivers as advertised; a heavy-hitting hop bomb cloaked in a ton of malt. The aging effect is evident as there is plenty of sugar on each sip. The prune-raisin combo is omnipresent and increasingly dominant with each sip.

F: this is a mildly viscous, smooth beer. Virtually no alcohol burn and minimal carbonation. Goes down relatively easy for a 10% ABV.

Here we are, review #1300!! For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium. This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple

Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time

Wow. I just had to give this one a bump in the overall. So unique and ever changing, it’s addicting. I’m so happy I picked up a 6 pack of this whale, and happy to finally have it in the books"
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.7,"Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021. The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.

In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head.

The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake.

The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.

Cheers!"
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.94,"Amazing Quadrupel. If you cannot get your hands on it, just go with the St. Bernardus ABT.

It gets even better with a few years age on it if stored properly with existing molasses and chocolate undertones coming out in full force. There is a reason why this is a top rated bier for decades and not just because it is difficult to obtain."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.68,"Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light.

Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep.

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden.

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right.

Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class.
___________________________________________

Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:

Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)

330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.

Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.

This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.

(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)"

Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.93,"Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.62,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.24,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.

SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.

PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.

Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.

SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.

PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.84,"Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.
Poured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.
The aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.
The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.
The feel was very good, way too easy to drink. I expected something more viscous but this really works.
OA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!"
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.73,"I don’t know how old the bottle is, but purchased relatively recently and shipped from Belgium to me in Chicago. First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well. Overall this is worth the hype and I hope the style doesn’t lose its popularity anytime soon."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing. This one had rested for about 5 years. It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful stone fruit. The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world. It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world. Cheers.
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.63,"Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.

The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.

On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.

The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.

Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.

Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover."

The taste of alcohol doesn't smack your ass down hard at all... it just happens to be perfectly balanced and that's it... St. Bernardus or Rochefort will hit you straight in the face... I can't taste the plums, cherries, orange peels and shit... all I can taste is a strong ass beer that has been done right... take it or leave it..."

Taste: figs, figs, and figs. dates, a very moist cinnamon, fruit, and raisin cake, brown sugar, wood

Feel: smooth, a bit of heat, suprising as everyone says you can't detect the alcohol at all

Overall: the big question: is it the best beer ever? not as far as I can tell. it is fantastic, but it does have a bit of alcohol tang/bitterness/heat. a fantastic quad, but i'd probably take st. bernadus most days, especially because it's so much easier to get (this bottle was $39.99). no regrets, happy to cross it off the list, but i won't be seeking it out...unless I'm in belgium"

That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer?
This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed...
L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down.
S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.
T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.
F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.
O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed!
330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,"Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.

The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose."
Popular,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.27,Had this in Aruba …. Reputedly best beer in the world at the time. It was damn good…. Best beer in the world good?… it was good…. Not worth the 30-50 bucks I paid for it though
Popular,Burton Baton,4.29,"Pours a copper color. Smells of a light vanilla, probably hops, and oak. The taste was that of a clean and crisp beer. Very tasty and delicious. The 10% ABV is hidden but effective. I like it and will definitely get more when I get the next chance."
Popular,Burton Baton,3.94,"It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background.

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.

The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.

Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout."
Popular,Burton Baton,4.57,"Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic."

Pours golden amber with thick suds.

Smells like like oak barrel. Clean and sweet.

Tastes like a creamy dream. Can't even taste the 10% abv and that's a fact. Most oak barrel aged stuff is a bit cloying but this has perfect balance. After taste of spicy vanilla that leaves you wanting just 1 more sip. Superb.

Extremely excellent brew! Lots of love goes into this force of nature.

Expensive but damn this is worth it. Dogfish Head is still a top tier company and this one proves it like a MF."

Copper color. Left the sediment in the bottle. Khaki whit me head.

Pours a mildly hazy copper/orange with 2+ fingers of fluffy off whit head, tons of lacing

A lot of subtlety in the nose, but right off the bat I pickup citrus, specifically orange zest, a light vanilla and caramel malt. Very complex in aroma, I'm guessing the flavor will be the same

Yep, I was right. Complex, but balanced between a biting hop and sweet malt. I pick up the oak notes clearly, it plays off the more bitter hops really well. The vanilla is in your face on the finish, with a mild citrus aftertaste

Gentle carbonation leads to a medium-full bodied brew. Finishes sweet and soft, wouldn't guess 10%

I've been on a good streak lately with a lot of beers that I'm loving and this one is no different! Not sure I could drink a lot of it, but I'll come back to this every now and then"
Popular,Burton Baton,4.45,"This has been sitting in the fridge since I bought it in August as I waitd for some cold weather. Pours a brigt amber with heavy rotation orange tining. Head is thin but steady. Nose is wood and mint and vanila.

This is velvety in texture right off the bat, and while the flavors are rich and luxurious, they are also, for the style, subtle as hell. The primary flavors are caramel malt doused in oak and vanilla with peppermint, dark fruit, and black pepper in reserve. The texture is thick in the sip but there are very few other signs of high abv. This is an exquisite rarity. I am generally not a huge DFH fan and find them talented but inconsistent and overpriced. This is delicious and unique. Well done."
Popular,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.24,Finally enjoying this after many years of it sitting in my beer fridge.

Popular,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),2.61,"Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

Popular,Supplication,4.21,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

Overall, very interesting and very good beer."
Popular,Supplication,4.49,"Brief Review:

O: My 2nd of 3rd RR sours I picked up from SF. This may be their highest rated. Nice brown ale with cherries, almost like a Flander's. Not too tart, which I like. Flavors are nice and clean. Good balance overall.

Recommendation: Doesn't really blow me away for a sour with this kind of reputation, but it drinks nice and is a good Spring/Summer beer."
Popular,Supplication,4.45,Wild! Received this from a good friend in the Bay Area. Works for me - it’s complex and skewed towards sour funkiness… very much feels sophisticated.
Popular,Supplication,4.4,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $13.99. Bottled 4-27-21; consumed 4-26-22.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.

Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.

Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.

Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!"

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer

Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum

It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it

This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!"

Russian River Brewing
Date: 21 November 2019
I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!"

Popular,Supplication,4.67,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite."
Popular,Supplication,4.88,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right?

Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Nose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation.

Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer.

Feel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length.

Overall, this beer has held up incredibly well. Balance between candied cherry, and the pinot barrels is excellent. There is some oxidation, but do not think it is making this beer worse, but adds to the complexity."

Overall: This is one of my all time favorites. I had tried a number of wild ales before, but this is the on that got me hooked. Absolutely, a tremendous beer"
Popular,Double Trouble,3.68,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste."
Popular,Double Trouble,4.12,"Hazed, amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. Subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. Hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet, malty backbone. Lush aftertaste."
Popular,Double Trouble,4,"12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head, leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. Strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. Full bodied but carbonated , Strong citrus flavors, nice lasting bitterness, very tasty."
Popular,Double Trouble,3.94,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip.

Pours slightly hazy dark gold with excellent smooth foamy head that lingers well for the ABV and good lacing.

The aromas are more floral than pungent, with some good earthy aromas as well. Evocative of an old school over the pond IPA, rather than a piney American. But as the brew warms, pungent resins start to bloom.

The brew has a nice balance. A solid but delicate clean malt backbone offset with an ample earthy/floral hop flavor. Hints of honey, citrus, and graham in midstream. The brew finishes with growing resin and chive and some warming booze.

The mouthfeel is actually a shade beyond medium, and grows heavier as the brew warms, but the carbonation and leaning alcohol keep things in check.

Overall, a really good DIPA that combines a lot of different hop feels. Although it gets a little all over the place and unfocused as the brew warms."
Popular,Double Trouble,4.25,"Pours amber with a 1/2 inch tan head. Moderate lacing as you go. A bit hazy.

Aroma of orange, pine, grapefruit, floral.

Strong taste of pine, grapefruit, orange, a bit of pineapple. Resiny.

Medium to full bodied, heavy carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

Outstanding. A damn good IPA."
Popular,Double Trouble,3.87,"One more drink before I hit the ""hard stuff"" for New Years...

...and what a good choice I have made. Great looking orange-yellow brew with frothy, thick head. Great lacing all the way down the pint glass. The smell was full of citrus and the mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of decent carbonation. The taste is mostly what you will find when you take in an imperial IPA and overall, it's solid enough."
Popular,Double Trouble,3.97,"From notes 7/7/13: Pours an opaque deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that leaves motes and a small webby ring of lace. Aroma is grapefruit, orange and caramel malt backed by pine and melon. Taste is intense grapefruit with notes of orange, pine resin,tropical fruits, melon and caramel. Starts sweet with bitterness entering at mid-sip and becoming predominant in the finish and aggressively so in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, creamy, silky, a little oily in the finish and slightly chewy."
Popular,Double Trouble,4.19,"Pours a cloudy copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of grapefruit and spice. Taste is sweet and boozy. Good mouth feel. Creamy, easy drinking."
Popular,Double Trouble,4.18,"Lightly hazed gold with four fingers of bone color head. Very dense lacings.
Smell is malty with grapefruit hops.
Taste is malt forward with good grapefruit pine slightly dank hops.

Overall a tasty dipa. Bottled 06/19/19. The hops have most likely faded a bit."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,3.34,"Nice dark brown pour, big khaki head, to much for a glass of Coke, otherwise, nails it. Severely lacking in treats for the nose, some mild coffee aroma, taste buds say roasted malt, a bit of cocoa. It seems thin for the style, carbonation seemed ok.

This was purchased as part of a ""pick six"" and has some age, canned 1/26/22, if I see it fresh, I'll update."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.2,"Purchased at Fresh, in Tyler TX. Warmed in hands from fridge for ~30-60 sec. Poured into stein glass

Appearance:
Dark cola color with 2-3 inch, tan head

Nose:
Toasty aroma, with notes of cocoa, raisin, and spiced rum

Taste:
Initially, dark, burnt, and bitter. As the beer warmed, the bitter taste moved to the back end and notes of spiced rum and raisin, with a light sweetness. Milder bitterness on the back end.

Mouthfeel:
Initially thin, with fine effervescence. As the beer warmed, mouthfeel gained a small degree of body, but not significantly. About as expected for a 5.5% ABV beer.

Overall:
As someone who usually drinks brown, amber, or scotch ale, this was definitely outside my usual and, previously, I haven't had the best of experiences with stouts or porters. That being said, this was a darn good porter and one I would drink again!"
Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.31,"A classic standby. Looks great, and tastes great. Loads of chocolate and coffee, some dark fruits and caramel. Licorice, and a hint of vanilla. The finish is charred toast and hop resin. The mouthfeel borders on thin, but it still has a nice creaminess, and the dry finish is very pleasant. It's well balanced, and very drinkable all year round.

The aroma is subdued, but it's hot in Texas, so I'm having it cold (usually drink these at room temp). I know from experience that the nose is much livelier at room temp (though still not as lively as the palate)."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,3.18,"noted from journal (2015-2016): brown head, black body, smells like chocolate, roasted flavor with a hoppy finish, thick almost a pilsner finish

Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.27,"Brighton, Co:
LOOK: Pours an opaque darkest of brown to black color with an easy to pour 3b finger tan or light brown head that slowly fades but has overall good retention as well as lacing.
AROMA: Same roasted malts, bakers chocolate and cocoa.
TASTE: Again you get the roasted malts, bitter sweetness. Has a little smoky aftertaste.
Creamy and easy drinking."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.25,"For some reason I thought I had rated this one years ago. Apparently not.

Pours extremely dark brown, nearly black, with a nice fluffy cola head. Good lacing.

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, licorice, and some yeast.

The flavors follow the nose and that's just fine. Dark and semi-sweet chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, licorice, buttermilk and dark fruit (cherry) sourness, astringent roastiness at the finish.

Medium bodied. Incredibly drinkable for such a dark brew, owing to plenty of carbonation and a fairly drying finish.

Are there better American Porters? Sure. But at this price point and availability level? Nope. Wanna show someone the difference between a stout and a porter? This might be the perfect brew."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.02,2/11/22 Pitch black with a nice tan head. Roasted / burnt malt carries the day here. Some light coffee bitterness. Low ABV. Well balanced. Will add to the rotation.
Popular,Black Butte Porter,3.86,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my spiegelau stout glass.

It looks like Guinness (co2) on the pour which I'd say is a good thing. Those big beers usually seem to be pretty good looking. 1.5 finger head that fades to a decent covering of head. Almost pitch black but at the bottom of the glass you can see it's a dark brow color where some light can get through.

Smell is full and quite strong with some rosty malts shining through, but there is quite a bit of fermentation character here, mostly just the smell of ale yeast bit it is quite strong. Not a lot more going on here but it's very malt forward and seems quite strong.

On my first sip it's quite dry and decently bitter. Once again some of those roasty malts are hanging in the back. Quite a lot of that ale character is up front. Slight tartness coming from fermentation as well it seems. Not a british flavor here, but despite the american yeast, hops arent all that present here. Maybe some for bittering cause it has a higher ibu than a porter or stout from the UK, but it seems to be a very malt forward american porter. Good but could be a bit more balanced. As I drink the bitterness becomes less pronounced and the malts shine more and more.

Feel is quite smooth and creamy, not a lot of carbonation bit but it's there. Easy to put down but still rich like chocolate. Could be dangerous if it was less pricey but I like it.

Overall a decent day porter. I wish there was a bit more sweetness from the malt but that's just taste. It does seem a bit dry for a porter but the roasty dark malts shine nicely here."

Smell: Roasted malt, dark fruit, and a hint of smoke.

Taste: Charred malt, slight smoke, and a bitter bite with a finish to match. Also had a generic ""beer"" taste that was a little too prevalent for me.

Feel: Relatively smooth, medium carbonation.

Overall: Something I appreciated experiencing but can't see myself getting again. The bitterness and generic ""beer"" taste turned me off to it."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,4.7,"Purchased as a single bottle for $1.69 at Kroger. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear motor oil black with a sticky dark khaki head measuring two fingers. Excellent lacing, but rather poor head retention.
S - Funny enough, bubblegum is present and fairly upfront. Turbinado sugar and molasses follow closely, with hints of dark wheat and cacao.
T - Bauernbrot and slight bubblegum fade into a deep baker's chocolate and creamy ristretto espresso. Bittersweet and well-balanced. The finish is a bright molasses and French-roast coffee with chicory.
F - Creamy and easy-to-drink. Filling. Full-bodied with very light carbonation.
O - A great campfire beer! A complex (but not too complex) entry-level porter that's easy on the wallet. This is now one of my favorite brews. I highly recommend this, and will purchase a six-pack if I can find it."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,2.57,"One of those days where one (very sub-par) beer wasn't enough. No real head formed as it went into the glass. The weak (or maybe my sense of smell is going today) scent was of root beer, Bazooka bubble gum (do they still make that anymore) with a touch of citrus. It was definitely dark, though more molasses than black and almost as opaque. A buttery feel in the mouth followed by some carbonation as it slid down my throat. In between, a slightly smoky, cherry coffee? I guess... that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The aftertaste is a bit like bitter coffee dregs with a little too much sweet'n'low. 0 for 2 tonight and I'm out of beer and it is past beer's bedtime in the stores."
Popular,Black Butte Porter,3.98,"Solid black appearance. Slightly thin body with about average carbonation.
Aroma is molasses, malt,dark fruit,dark chocolate with just a bit of coffee.

Overall my description isn't doing this beer justice. Its a really well done beer that I would look for again."

Popular,Dragon's Milk,4,"First base Dragon's Milk I've had in years, since it was available at my local for $2 a bottle. Aroma and taste, barrel, vanilla. Smooth, strong, satisfying and totally worth the $6 paid today for 3, yes 3. How's that possible? Guess I'm just lucky, occasionally. I did love the 2021 Double Vanilla Reserve, the xtra vanilla and 3 months barrel aging was worth the $19. I like this beer, but would not pay the $19 for 4."
Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.5,A rich and smooth stout that’s definitely worth the hype. The 11% abv is noticeable on the finish and gives a pleasant warmth to this complex sipper.

Smell: Chocolate was the first thought along with a lot of roasted malts and a subtle hint of a coffee smell to follow at the end.

Feel: Very smooth taste, very little carbonation.
Overall: I definitely would buy this 4 pack again and it's definitely worth the $15-$20 you spend. Just watch out, it's so smooth that you might find yourself downing this bad boy quickly but it WILL creep up on you. Be aware"
Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH goblet glass

This beer is completely black with no visible highlights and about one fingers worth of dark tan head that quickly recedes leaving behind a fair amount of lacing.

Lots of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon caramel, and coffee. The bourbon is fairly strong, but not overpowering, and adds just a bit of spice to the nose.

The dominant flavors are that of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, coffee, and to a lesser degree vanilla. Just the right amount of bourbon character, noticeable but not overpowering. Very well balanced. Full bodied and mildly carbonated.

Overall, this is a very nice Barrel Aged Stout, a great mix of barrel character and base beer, neither leaning too heavily on the other."

Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.03,"Not a ton of barrel tones but more a balanced bourbon and vanilla flavor. I more or less hated the variants I've tried and I made it clear what I thought about those but the original I think I definitely understand better, this is pretty good and don't mind I bought a pack of it. I served this to myself in one of those weird sour glasses and it works. I get people roasting this for calling it basic but that's the thing it is basic but this actually decently crafted. The variants I had to me not so much"
Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.25,"Appearance: Deep amber in color with a massive, coarse, and quite persistent tan head. Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls. Before a strong light at the thinnest part of the glass, some slight ruby highlights can be seen.

Aroma: Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, bitter cocoa, vinous alcohol, molasses and caramel dominate the aroma. There are also notes of wood; the alcohol is quite spicy.

Taste: The taste begins with notes of molasses, caramel, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, dark fruit, spicy alcohol. As the taste progresses, the wood and bourbon notes firm a solid undercurrent to the taste, advancing as the taste progresses, as well as bitter cocoa. The alcohol produces a moderate and pleasant warming sensation. The taste concludes with a modest and lingering wave of bourbon and wood.

Mouth feel: Fairly full and soft, with only modest carbonation.

Drinkabilty/notes: Really quite nice, and a fitting toast to the New Year of 2022. Would pair admirably with rich chocolate desserts.

Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip."
Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.02,"12oz bottle, served in a snifter glass. Bottled on 09/30/21 09:26.

Appearance: Pitch black, light tan dense head. Some strands and sheets of lacing which dissipated very slowly.

Smell: Vanilla, light oak, bourbon.

Taste: Well blended chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roasted malt. Nothing really stands out among the flavors. All are mild and well blended together.

Mouthfeel: Nice thickness, quite warming from the higher ABV, even though it's not harsh or that noticeable. Dry finish. Very light carbonation.

Overall / Drinkability: A very subtle/smooth barrel aged stout. There is some bourbon barrel character, but it's mixed in with all the other flavors. A good sipping beer - quite drinkable. Would pair well with some desserts, and maybe a few other main courses as well. Quite nice and I wouldn't mind having it again."

Too fuckin sweet and simplistic for the high price . Very over rated. Not bad, just not as good as the rating is here on this place.

Popular,Dragon's Milk,4.49,"Given to me from a four-pack of bottles from a friend. Poured into a proper brandy snifter.

L - Pitch black with a one-finger cream-colored head. Pours very thick, with delicate legs.
S - Cacao is very upfront. Notes of leather, vanilla, and brown sugar.
T - Vanilla and cacao are the stars here! Leads slowly into a deep toffee with bourbon and coffee notes. You can't really taste the 11%, but it gives off 11% vibes. Finish is a lingering bourbon and sweet chocolate.
F - Silky, full-bodied, and with light - almost nitro-like - carbonation. It's strong for sure, but you can definitely handle another bottle.
O - A well-done brew of the style. A must-try. The best lounge beer, provided you're in a leather chair and next to a warm fire! I will buy this so long as they keep making it. Again, well done!"
Popular,Bomb!,4.99,"Simply a perfect beer. First the history- Prairie Bomb! changed the alcohol laws in Oklahoma to open up the door for higher alcohol content beers and a wave of new craft breweries. The complexity is incredible. In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation. Slight bubbles, small head are a delicate balance which is also hard with this style. Appropriately named, this one will sneak up on you. Best beer from the best brewery in Oklahoma. Period."
Popular,Bomb!,4.41,"12 oz bottle into a Firestone Walker snifter. 13% ABV. Looks like it was bottled in June 2022, but that’s a guess through a clump of yellow numbers on the bottle neck.
Zero head, get straight to the point I guess.,
Smell is milk chocolate, plum, vanilla.
Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.
Feel is not-quite motor oil thick, a little oily, very low carbonation, but enough to add a little fizzle to the sizzle.
Overall, a real treat. Big Stout!"
Popular,Bomb!,4.24,"bottle into glass
Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer. At the very tail end of the finish, there is a bit of coffee, on the palate."
Popular,Bomb!,4.06,"Looks rich, not much carbonation from this bottle. Smells sweet and vanilla comes through. Taste is full of each of the advertised flavors - chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a hint of spicy. It feels smooth and thick. Tasty beer."

A: Pours an opaque dark brown with a 1 finger medium brown, slightly rocky head. Moderate lacing on the glass upon consuming.

S: Roast barley aroma with overtones of coffee and cocoa.

T: Follows smell with slight added heat from chillies.

F: Viscous, pours smooth over the tongue with a velvety thickness. No burn from the alcohol.

O: A very worthwhile imperial stout, not horrendously expensive. Prairie Artisan knows what they are doing. I'd buy it again."

As you sip coffee, choclate hits mildly then vanilla and mild spice.
Very nice balance of flavors."
Popular,Bomb!,5,"Wow, what do I say about ""Bomb!""? I'm somewhat of an amateur, all I could focus on for this one was the overwhelming spiciness. Beyond that, I definitely taste the coffee and chocolate as the primary flavors. This flavor was very complex, which is why I gave it a 5. I strongly enjoy beers that are ""different,"" and this is nothing like I have ever tasted. Extremely interesting beer, this is about my 6th of the night, and at 13% ABV for this one, I'm pretty gone by now. If you enjoy ""different"" or ""unique"" beers this is for you."
Popular,Bomb!,4.29,"Really good stout!!!! I bought a 12 oz. bottle at Half Time Distributors in Poughkeepsie NY, mainly because I am collecting bottle caps from all 50 states and Oklahoma was a real ""find"". I had no idea how really good this beer would be. Pours a totally dense black color with no light coming through. Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane. An excellent stout, I would gladly drink this one again as long as I was not expected to function 100% afterwards!!"
Popular,Expedition Stout,4.24,"New to me, and a solid daily drinker; for an RIS, to me at least! I use Old Rasputin as my benchmark, but this one is not expensive and delivers on flavor! Unlike the famous ones that have 10% more flavor and 50% more cost. Dark pour from chilled bottle in to 12oz. pint glass. Some head, decent. Motor oil consistency; can't see through it. Just a hint of fruit sweetness, but not overly so. Not sure where the sweetness comes from, but it is muted. Great roasted, coffee, dark chocolate, malty flavor. Nice mouthfeel; just about right for RIS. This has some smokiness to it (for me), and I love that. It has both a bit of sweet and bitter finish. But walks the line pretty well here; not going overly one direction. Nice after dinner drink by the fire!"

Popular,Expedition Stout,4.54,"Found this one in our local grocery store known for a manager who loves his brews. After opening the first bottle, I immediately lifted the bottle to my nose. The aroma of a malting barn hit me. The heavy, rich, sweet aroma took me back to my days baling wet hay on the family farm. Organic, real, substantive, with sweet smells. Very few beers have hit me this way. The taste was rich and full. I may have found the beer to replace Dragon’s Milk as my second favorite after Founder’s KBS."

Medium full body, moderate minus carbonation; some warmth from 11.5% abv; dryish finish. Overall, layers of flavors, however, at almost one year old the char/bitterness is still strong with a long bitter linger; a tasty RIS, yet more bitter roast than I want…it would be interesting to see how this beer tastes in a few years."

Overall: A Russian imperial stout that isn’t afraid to show off the hoppy side of the style. Solid."
Popular,Bud Light,1.97,"16 oz draft pour at a Twins game. Looks like a light lager. Smells vaguely of hops and malt. The flavor isn't terrible, but it is very watery. It was free. I drank less than half of it. No interest in revisiting this half-beer in the future."
Popular,Bud Light,2.78,"Poured from a 25oz can best by Oct 27th 2022

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest."
Popular,Bud Light,2.2,"how i have been waiting for this day. in ireland, bud light is a relatively new addition to the market, and where it is sold it’s usually sold in 4 packs. now im hardly buying 4 cans of most beer, let alone this, but sure enough today in my local shop there were loose cans, i didn’t really know what to expect from this to be honest, and to be honest it really isn’t as bad as i was expecting, there’s nothing particularly astringent about it, that being said it is some pretty cruddy lager, it’s just a vacuum of flavour, white bread malt and a faint sweetness, no bitterness, medium to high carbonation, reasonably drinkable but incredibly thin and watery, yeah it’s not good, but it’s not the worst either"
Popular,Bud Light,2.85,"The first time I had a Bud Light, I wanted a Bud Light Lime. You can do worse in terms of beer, I know folks who treat this drink with anathema. The fact of the matter is that you can consume a Bud Light and drive sober by the time you've finished a savory Mexican dish."

Popular,Bud Light,1.43,"No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass. There's no head, no glass lacing, almost no aroma and it's one of the most transparent amber colors you'll ever see. There are vague taste references to yeast, malt, hops and alcohol, without any discernable hierarchy. There is some decent carbonation and it's blandly drinkable. Still, it's not worth the time, calories or expense, unless it's free. In that case, reread the other two reasons not to drink it."

I can buy this again"

Good for those days when I want to drink 3 or more beers without ""paying the price"" the next day.

Popular,Hoptimum,2.71,"Yields a clear amber color with a bigger, stable head.

The aromas lead with ripe passion fruit, caramel and dried lime zest among flowery blueberries and nutty honey.

Drinks soft, with a smooth mouthfeel and a well nuanced, late effervescence, which successfully manages to establish a slightly alcoholic refreshment.

Tastes of sweet caramel, creme brulee and white bread dough, together with bitter, pungent limes and a sweet, resinous malt backbone. Offers an equally sweet middle part with a medicinal hop bitterness, bringing out a buttery, toffee leaden sweetness. Finishes soft with a layer of whipped cream and additional caramel, only to invite a hop bitterness, which numbs the tongue like a local anesthesia, revealing a faint hint of alcohol.

Not a big fan as this seems not very balanced, as well as the beer‘s single components seem unable to create a flavorful synergy. Everything in this is overpronounced and standing in its own way, trying to steal the show while being too full to dance."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.38,"This beer is hands down one of the best Imperial IPAs in the world. Nothing but hops from the head down, smell and taste is of hop resin, pine and slight grapefruit. You can also smell and taste a slight booziness which is inevitable for this type of beer. The ultimate cure for a hop fix if you’ve ever needed one."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.25,"Pours a fairly clear golden color with about two inches of a light tan head. The smell is of some citrus, strong pine and hops. The taste is definitely on the pine and hops side and the alcohol is hidden well. Definitely worth it."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.23,"Enjoyed it when I was new to craft beer, appreciate it still as an experienced hop head. It has all the marks of quality, but is as inoffensive as a hoppy, high abv, in-your-face beer can be. Lots of malts and well rounded hops that aren’t overly bitter or resinous, but still taste citrusy and flavorful. Too booze and too sweet. But overall a well made brew."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.58,"The pour and appearance is beautiful. Reddish gold, nearly two inches of head, great retention, mostly clear. It doesn't taste high abv, but you do feel it on your tongue and as you drink it. Good amount of pine and definitely a western. Taste gets better as it warms a bit. Very smooth. Great IPA. A new favorite."

S: Creamy tropical fruit; mango, guava, pineapple, and pine resin.
T: Rich and creamy tropical fruit concentrated with pine resin. Floral notes on the finish, and a lingering piney bitterness that plays back and forth with a bit of tropical sweetness.
F: Incredibly smooth from start to finish. The alcohol is very noticeable in the mouth and chest.
O: Similar flavor profile to Heady Topper, but a bit sweeter; would be fun to do a side by side. Shockingly smooth for how high the ABV is. Glad I finally found one."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.16,"pours a hazy pale amber body with a cream colored foam head that billows with moderately high retention that leaves a high amount of patchy sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy cap with defined halo

aroma is sweet floral and earthy grapefruit and misc citrus with a malty dark caramel malt backbone

taste follows that up with a honeyed sweetness and a trace amount of pine that flashes towards the end; it's sweet but very hoppy, eventually balancing out. a certain fruitiness can be picked out eventually, but it is nondescript outside of being citrus adjacent.

mouthfeel is high carbonation and thick bodied - a constant battle between thickness and carbonation pillowing. it ultimately runs mid-way between smooth, thick, crisp before abruptly finishing dry and syrup-sweet with a grapefruit hop aftertaste with tinges of lowkey pine

overall:
pretty killer, but balance is missing. it's sweet, honey sweet with a thickness that is at battle with the carbonation to create a disheveled feel that is hard to settle into. it is certainly hoppy, but perhaps a little crowded - the features blend together and meld into more of a flashcard representation rather than a display of different players coming together to make something bigger by highlighting their complementary features."

Pours light amber with clarity and 1/2- to 1-finger creamy, cream-colored head, with good retention, leaving nice lace down the glass. Sweet malt aroma off pour, then aromas of grass and pine, and some stone fruit showing as warms. Begins with carbonation and big hop bite, over smooth malt body, soon nearly overwhelmed by alcohol beginning to build, then some sharp and sweet stone fruits are also evident, before a big but not unbalanced bitter piney and alcohol heat finish.

Unsurprisingly, has none of the common defects in huge IPAs, and is an appropriate biggest brother to SNPA and Torpedo."
Popular,Hoptimum,4.46,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass in September 5, 2021. There is a ""Package"" date of 05/14/2021 on the bottle.

Appearance: Medium gold color with 2 finger white head. It is slightly hazy, but less hazy than New England IPAs. Head lasts a minute, and there is a little lacing.

Smell: Strong aroma from the hops as expected in an IPA: mostly pine and grapefruit, Also some sweetness like pineapple. Overall the pine and citrus aroma dominates the other aromas.

Taste: There is a strong hops flavor that is both refreshing and bitter. Very fruity and contains flavors of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and a little sweetness as well. Hoptimum has as a very nice after taste. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Strong bodied. High alcohol, which matches the 11.0% listed. I nice thick feel when drinking.

This is a great IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it interesting. It has stronger flavors and body than most other IPAs. This has a good hop bite, but not over-powering. It is a very good IPA, and I would buy this again. One of my favorite IPAs."

Popular,Hoptimum,4.11,"Bottling date 4-7-21.
Bright, orange-amber color with a white head that slumped to what looked like a ring of lace fire lapping at the curved glass walls. Clear with a faint murk, no rising bubbles visible but they cascade when swirled.
The smells are classic old school left coast IPA. Big bouquet of flowers and spruce tips, sweet honey, blood orange and apricot jam along side toffee dipped in vodka notes.
First taste is sweet up front but flavoring/ mid boil hops move in quickly to balance the rich, caramel malt backbone. Great complexity and balance - lush and heavy on the tongue but the hop character stands up and keeps this from being cloying.
Not a beer for big gulps, this is a snifter sipper that will have you looking for another soon after draining the glass.
Full bodied and a bit harsh on the back end bitterness and sharp with alcohol but dangerously drinkable and seriously well balanced."

Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,2.33,Its a really carbonated and standard malty beer. I get a festive-Christmas like after taste from this beer which reminds me of nutmeg or cinnamon. I don't like that part. Earthy and nutty is how I would describe it. However more earthy. It's not a bad beer by any margin just not something that I enjoy. I leave beers for my own record so based for my tastes it's a 2.5 type of beer.
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into narrow gauge pint glass.

Appearance: Copper colored body. Big & dense bone white head.

Smell: Malt forward aroma. Light caramel, toasty, slightly nutty. Earthy hops perhaps? They are light and its hard for the nose to pull out the aroma.

Taste: Toasty, grainy, and lightly nutty malt profile. A bready element in there as well. Complex and smooth malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. Gentle earth and floral notes.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. moderate carbonation level. Creamy textured body.

Overall: My first time drinking a California common / steam beer. This beer was an obvious choice because it is readily available with a wide distro footprint and it's one of those old school beer's that has a certain nostalgia about it. This is a really excellant beer. I can see why it's iconic beer for sure. I would drink a bunch of these on a hot day at an outdoor potluck or BBQ."

Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,4.04,"Poured from a 12oz can.

The look is a nice solid amber, crystal clear with lively carbonation and a one finger head. Dissipates over a minute to a thin covering. No lacing

Aroma is giving me strong malty lager vibes here. Very lager aroma maybe some hops here, but they are definitely a small amount of bittering only hops. Maybe a bit of off aroma, slight skunk even with the can, but it could be an older can.

Taste leaves the off flavor right in the dust this is delicious. Right up front is amber lager similar to the aroma but it quickly goes into a weird ester-y altbier sort of thing and it's very interesting theres quite an evolution on this one despite seeming pretty basic when I got into it. Some hop bitterness on the very back end. Dont know what to really compare it to. But it's quite malty.

Feel is nice and creamy big body in the mouth bit still very easy to put down. Its al.ost like a milkshake in texture but liquid and carbonated if you can catch my drift l. Probably not but it's good. All year.

Overall a very interesting beer. I'm glad I got it. Not really comparable to any other style, but so easy to drink malty decadent lager ale wonderland, despite the cover (which your not supposed to judge by) only looking average at best."
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,4.23,"I ordered a Fat Tire, but the bar was out and the bartender recommended Anchor Steam as a good alternative. I'm glad he did.

Look - dark amber, nice head that lasted.

Smell - malty with hints of sweetness

Taste - really good. The malt shines with just the right amount of hops in the background

Feel - Above average with moderate carbonation

Overall, I really enjoyed this and will order it again if I see it on a menu. I've never seen it in stores around me (southeast)."
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,3.99,"Two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug reveal a pretty colored beer. It's brightly copper-amber and rather translucent. The slightly off-white head is much larger than what should have been expected for a reasonably gentle pour of a chilled brew. Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat."
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,3.54,"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber from the can, light, creamy 1"" head with moderate retention but great lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with sticky malt, toffee, and light yeast notes; barley tea as it develops deeper on the palate.

Presents herbal & spicy hops aroma and flavors on a mostly sweet malt backbone. There is hint of mint. Moderate bitterness. Nice, easy drinker. More flavorful than typical American golden pilsners/lagers. Nice looking beer in the glass. Always a joy to revisit."
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,3.68,This is one of my all-time favorites. Not for any one thing but for the sum total that it is. It's not too heavy to drink a four or so and it's heavy enough to know you are not drinking watered down corn fermented corn juice which I detest. The hop amount is nigh on perfect for the masses yet enough for the aficionado who discerns the kind and type. They never need to change this one as it is the perfect high-quality everyman's brew. I say that but it does command a more premium price than a everyman's brew and in most areas is only available in sixers (i.e. no 12-packs and no cases which is a huge mistake). I have only one more thing to say and that is I would drink this happily if there were no other brews and that is in spite of the new yellow and blue labeling which sucks as the previous label was the absolute best in the who brewing business.
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,4,"L: Pours amber. Mild carbonation and nucleation. Remarkably clear.

S: Roasty toasty barley. Bready sweetness, and a touch of hops.

T: Tangy and zangy, caramelized grain.

O: I would relate this to Shiner Bock or Okocim. It's rather nice. I'm going to read about it and see what they have to say, now."
Popular,Anchor Steam Beer,4.38,"Generally an underrated beer. Pours a crystal clear copper color with an off white head, the slight head from 12 oz bottle dissipating in a few minutes. A clean malty nose with a mild more English ale hop note. This beer has a wonderful malt and hop balance, Lightly carbonated, an enjoyable clean malty taste with a crisp bitterness, think northern brewer / Kent goldings, unique in style, with a total absence of the typical Cascade piney notes. Totally unique and the canonical steam beer, the mix of pale and caramel malts provide a very slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the level of bitterness. Very drinkable, a really lovely beer."
Popular,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. PKG 07APR22, so this is almost four months old.

Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.

Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

As mentioned in my Sculpin review (last night), this was also one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. Thusly, I never got around to actually reviewing it. At the time I just knew that I liked it, but couldn't articulate what about it I liked. Finally, 3 years later it's getting an actual review. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy amber gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Obviously some hops can give off a pithy grapefruit character, but it's easy to tell that it's just straight up grapefruit used in this one. I'm picking up on aromas of fresh ruby grapefruit, bready malt, white pepper, earthy hops, and light pineapple

In the OG, the aroma is far superior to the taste. Here, they meet in the middle and equalize, matching each others intensity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, sweeter grapefruit juice, grassy hops, bready malt, and light lemon. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, orange rind, bready malt and light pine

A light medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet biting beer. Finishes mostly dry without much sweetness

It's good, great even. But it doesn't match the smoothness of the original. Definitely a worthy variant and it stands on its own as a good beer"
Popular,Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.31,"It's been some years since I had this as one of my neighbors gave me a can he purchased in Cincinnati.

I liked it, but have not sought it out."

The taste is almost exclusively bitter which is good and then the grapefruit and some bready malts.

Glad I tried it but not really my style"
Popular,Gumballhead,3.98,"Look: It pours golden with brilliant clarity. It has a white head with very good head retention.

Smell: It has grapefruit and citrus flavors. There is a low grassy element to it with slight yeast and some earthly notes.

Taste: It has strong citrus flavors with grapefruit. There are doughy flavors after the initial flavor which is strong in the finish. There are some earthen flavors and lemon as well.

Feel: It has a medium body with a hoppy bitter, but not harsh finish.

Overall, it's has plenty of flavor with citrus, grapefruit and lemon being the strongest up front and dough and earth finishing it off."

Nose: Nutty, coffee and toffee. Lightly roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and some chocolate at the end.

Taste: Creamy but a little bit dry upfront. Not as malty as I assumed it would be. It is slightly dry and a bit like sucking on a lightly toasted coffee bean. Astringent throughout. I get an unpleasant bitterness from the hops. So much so that I switched glasses halfway through to make sure it wasn't my glass. My eyes and my nose wanted this to taste a certain way, but my mouth said otherwise. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad watery.

Notes: I was excited for this one as Dogfish usually hits it out of the park (in my opinion). I think the hops being added to what should be a bit maltier brew throws this one off. It's a great idea, but doesn't know what it wants to be."

Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.44,"Found this classic at Gary's in Madison not too long ago, as I never had this before. Love 3 Floyds and was glad to see them return to this neck of the woods recently as they were one of the breweries that got me into craft beer, well over 15 years ago. Indeed, this was worth the hype as it's still one of the better Imperial IPA's after all of these years!

Such a beautiful copper hue to this as it was topped off with a ton of head that made this look like a loaf of bread, but with hops. Gorgeous, layered lacing stayed behind as I worked my way through this as I don't think I've ever seen so many rings on my glass at one time. Caramel, earthy hops, pine, dark bread, stone fruit, and a bit of tea spice were in the nose as the taste was just as deep, varied, and enjoyable. This wasn't weak but didn't quite feel as strong as it's listed ABV%, which made this that much more impressive. Toasted malt, weed, and a hint of chocolate stuck around in the back as this was a wonderfully layered beer that opened up nicely once it fully warmed.

This was strong but in the sense that there was so much flavor here as the alcohol was on par with everything else going on. Packaged on 3/21, this held up amazingly well and would be something that I'd easily reach for again. Really impressed with this as I'm glad that this is available here as I can't recommend this enough. It's easily worth it's lofty rating on here as this was an old-school brew that's easily withstood the test of time!"
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.43,"16oz can from Beers of the World. Golden pour with a white fluffy head. Fruity, malty aroma, caramel, pine. Taste is some piney, mildly astringent hops coupled with sweet toffee notes. Bitterness and warmth rise up at the finish."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.38,"ABV: 9.4%
IBU: 86
BOF #42 (currently)

Clear deep amber. Moderately carbonated. Very tall off-white head. The head is thick and creamy appearing with excellent retention. The surface becomes rocky and pitted as it does slowly recede.

The aroma is old-school IPA. Citrus – grapefruit, hints of pine and resin. Melon. Crackers and bread.

The initial taste favors the crackers and melon for the first few milliseconds, but with the grapefruit and pine coming quickly and dominating. Yet, these flavors back off a bit near the finish with a woody tannin and hops bitterness sharpening the end. The aftertaste lingering is bitter grapefruit, tannin and pine, and bitter. And, yet, the finish and aftertaste is on the sweet side. The alcohol is nowhere to be found except in the eventual buzz. The bitterness in the aftertaste intensifies as I progress through the beer, but if anything, that just makes this beer even better. Very well balanced.

The mouth feel is substantial – creamy, thick even for an IPA.

Overall, this is in line with my expectations. That may sound less than high praise, except that my expectations were quite high to begin with given the brewer and the BOF rank of this beer. An excellent DIPA. One to enjoy. Those of the juicy hazy milkshake “IPA” crowd, well, you should just move along."
Popular,Dreadnaught,3.91,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 03/21/22""
There is some text below that but it has a big ink blot on it and can't be read.

Appearance: The body is a nice medium gold and light sun tea color. It has good clarity with a light opalescence. There is a medium-sized frothy white head with both very good head retention and good lacing.

Aroma: It has a pleasant wildflower aroma which is obvious and present but not strong. There are hints of hay-grass and pollen. A light mint aroma as well. It smells good.

Taste: Up front there is a light bit of peach with a touch of spearmint. Towards the middle of the mouth there is this light bit of caramel and some pleasant mint flavor. There are earthy notes of oak and twig with hints of tea leaf. Towards the back of the palate there is more of an earthy mint character. It finishes with a bit of cocoa chocolate flavor and toasted oak. It has a lot of complex and interesting flavors.

Mouthfeel: The body feels clean and on the lower side of medium bodied. It sticks to the tongue when it needs to but leaves it when appropriate. It has a medium hop bitterness and what feels like a bit of grain bitterness. Great carbonation.

Overall: It's a solid beer. It has a bit more of an earthy focus with mint notes and hints of oak, giving the beer a lot of depth and complexity. It isn't really an East Coast or West Coast style Imperial IPA which is kind-of fitting for a brewery located in Indiana. 3 Floyds really seems to hit their stride in this beer. By the time the glass is gone you want another one. I highly recommend it, and it's worth picking up at least a 4-pack. I would definitely drink it again. The highlight in this beer is the woody, oaky character that it has."

Overall: I've had some great old-school WCIPAs recently (Double Dale's is excellent) but this isn't one of the better ones."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.18,"If I read the label of this great brew I might not have expected the genuine bitterness with not a hint of the usual juicy finish. I'm not disappointed, I just wasn't ready for what was to come. At $5.16 it is a poor value. My sample is exactly one month old.

It pours golden, translucent and fizzy. The aroma is pretty intense if you really go in for it - nice and citrusy. The taste is all dark malty and bitter hops with a thick and very bitter finish.

Recommended. I like a lot of 3 Floyds stuff, and this one is like the extra large version, with an extra bitter profile. Overpriced."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.4,"Haven't had this beer in a long time. I found a 4-pack of tall boys dated two weeks out. Very fresh! How could I resist. This is your classic old school DIPA. Pours a mostly clear amber color, with a giant frothy head that sticks around forever. Aroma has some nice citrus notes with a touch of pine. Flavor is classic, while the hops steal the show, mostly an orangey citrus but some nice pine sap too, there is a nice malt presence, reminiscent if lightly toasted biscuits. Finishes fairly bitter, while the impression is borderline sweet, overall the palate remains dry with a lingering bitterness. Damn, I miss DIPAs (and IPAs in gereal) like this. So tasty! Yes, you can still find old school DIPAs, but they seem to get lost in the sea of hazies."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.38,"Old school DIPA from Three Floyd’s. I’ve been so happy since we’ve started getting tons of their beers, including the barrel aged bottles. I love getting to drink these reasonably priced old school IPAs.

Popular,Dreadnaught,4.5,"So I'm updating from my 2013 rating. I gave it a 4.5 then. This probably isn't a good comparison.
I stopped by Glendale Liquors on Rt. 27 in South Brunswick and saw Dreadnaught, and didn't even give any thought to the $18/4pack price. Until sitting here looking at reviews and warming up on a Nugget Nectar, I never even thought to check the date. But I saw a review that says 3F have discontinued this beer. So I looked. I can barely make it out, but there it is, ""Pkgd on 2/14/21.""
Apparently, Glendale charged me $18/4 for a year old beer. Shame on me for trusting them. But lets see how it is aged. At 9.4% ABV, its got to retain something, though I don't expect it to be hops.
So it looks like a fine NE IPA...dirty blonde color with a good head, so hazy, its opaque...I'm trying to remember if its unfiltered? Do they do that in Indiana?
Age has definitely impacted the nose. I'm getting a moderately sweet, breadyness with no trace of pine or citrus.
Age hasn't been kind to the flavor, either. mostly that barleywineish sweetness with bitterness around the edges. Mouthfeel is still very chewy and quite lovely. But I won't add ratings to waterdown what I gave before.
But after a year, i'd give it 4.25, 3, 2.5, 4.25, 3.25.
And a warning to doublecheck the dates when you think you found something good at Glendale Liquors on Rt 27!!!!"
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.47,"I am usually more an APA drinker with the occasional gem of an IPA. My last was Pliny the Elder. I was not expecting to reminisce of it from 3 Floyds, and from a $4.99 4-pack, no less.

A refreshing looking amber hue with candied pine on the nose. A burst of citrus ages to tropical fruit over a few seconds, then a pop of pepper and a grapefruit finish. It finishes with strong herbal notes that never overpower. A light, creamy orange washes over the palate soon after.

Just an absolute pleasure. I've been a big fan of 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust, but found their other variations much more of the same. Dreadnaught was expected to disappoint. I wondered why it was the last pack on the rack. I wonder no longer. World-Class, indeed."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.4,"Pours a translucent golden color with a large fluffy head that ends up as lots of lacing.

Initially smells of slightly dank piney hops. A warmer glass adds grapefruit and pine apple.

Tastes of piney hops with sweet malt upfront with citrus and pineapple coming out as my glass got warmer. It has a slightly bitter and boozy finish.

This is a not overly assertive west coast IPA with some sweeter nuances and a punch.

Medium body with light carbonation. Light dry mouthfeel."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.25,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 2/15/21, so 4 months old.

Looks outstanding in the glass. Clear pale amber body with a massive cream colored head. This slowly dissipates to a collar and solid covering, leaving layers of lacing.

Not much of an aroma here, not that I have much of a nose. A little musty fruit.

On tasting, a strong sweet malty wave washes through the mouth. Just when you start to think ""malt bomb?"", the palate is attacked by a pine/resin/grapefruit assault. Like 2 beers in one. Me liking this.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish pine citrus bitterness.

Overall, just an outstanding old school dipa. Would love to compare this 4 month old can with one fresh off the line. Holds up extremely well."

Continuing with Three Floyds Beer, Dreadnaught is next. The last Pale ale was tasty, looking forward to this one. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy, foamy, and creamy with excellent retention. The dissipation left chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with orange hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with a few yeast floaties. A stellar presentation for the beer.

I first detect pine, grapefruit, floral esters, and resin. Next, I smell biscuits, lemons, a touch of passion fruit, wet grass, phenols, caramel, and a hint of dankness.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, resin, pine needles, lemons, pineapple, fruity esters, phenols, oranges, caramel, a wee bit of toffee, malty sweetness, grapefruit, herbal, and a hint of pharmaceutical.
The mouthfeel of the beer is warming, astringent, and tannic.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.

This is a perfect example of Imperial IPA. The hop profile is extraordinary. The malt backbone is firm but not overbearing. It reminds me of Ruination, but better. I am enjoying this beer."
Popular,Dreadnaught,4.53,"This, I think, is my first rating in NINE years. (I've done a lot in the intervening time on Untappd, but BA will always have a soft spot for me.)

So, as I understand it, FFF is no long producing this beer. I bought it recently for a mere $9 from a local shop. It was bottled April 2018.

I first had this beer a good 20-odd years back. This sample reminded me how incredible FFF is. Although this has citrus and mango fruits in the mix, at 3+ years, those fruits have ceded to the malts, pine and...a nice, dry finish.

I need to get back to that local beer shop and my the remaining stock of these big berthas. I think they had 5 or 6 remaining and in a fridge.

Gonna miss it when it's gone, but enjoying it now immediately transports me back 20 years. Ahhhh..."

Popular,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.5,"This review will only be limited to the category of American Adjunct Lager. With that said we can skip the looks smell and feel because it doesnt matter when it comes to this. Pabst is probably my favorite of all the commercial beers with Miller Highlife right behind it. Never have understood why so many people insist on drinking Bud Light and it's the worst we'll,. I take that back. Natural Light is the worst beer in history but it is the same company. Anybody remember when Bud Dry was introduced? I have a suspicion that they accidently fermented all the sugars out of a batch making it dry as in 0 on a hydrometer. They tried to sell what they could but nobody liked it. The commercial said ""Why Ask Why?"". ""Drink Bud Dry"". Anyway, Pabst is pretty good with lime and salt but always make sure it is as cold as ice without freezing. It's the best of the shit beers so to say."

Popular,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.7,"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass

On the pour a 2 finger head forms which reduces relatively slowly for the style to ring around the rim and a covering of fine bubbles over the whole beer. Body is light gold a bit darker than bmc beers, but very similar. Relatively lazy carbonation for the style, and crystal clear.

Aroma is very light, but it seems like a good thing as there isn't a lot of malt or anything else going on. Some adjunct sweetness and generic lager aroma but nothing fantastic or notable. Possibly vaguely corny and chemically as well, but not disgusting.

Flavor follows the aroma with adjunct sweetness followed by some vague malts and corniness. The flavor then goes into its yeasty flavors which is dominated by a dry generic lager flavor with a bit of diacetyl thrown in for fun it seems. Not much is really off, but there is so little malt flavor that's all that really comes through.

Feel is not the best for the style either, head doesn't really return to give a creamy feel but rather has mostly carbonation bite leaving the beer feeling rather dense. Still light compared to other styles but the feel was all that was really left for this beer to redeem itself.

Overall it's boring with just enough off and no real redeeming qualities to make it one that I'm not going to come back to. No malt flavors and the adjunct ""maltbill"" is so obvious that it's not even funny. Feels like corn soda almost."

A flat out bad beer you can't drink and just give up on. With PBR you keep trying and by the time you figure out it's a road to nowhere it's too late. Which makes it the beer I hate most in the world. My advice is to limit to 1 12 oz serving or dump those 4 last ounces from the tall boy on principle. Probably was better before megacorp X bought it."

My continuing quest for the best has to lead me to this beer. I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles.

I first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.

The flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect.

The mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy.

The body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish.

This beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing. The hops are subtle but firm giving away to the spice addition in the beer. If I could get this beer, it would be a staple in my beer fridge."

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread and cracker malts upfront. This follows into a banana and clove ester quality. A bit of banana bread and Belgian spice. Some juicyfruit, but ultimately it smells malty. (3.75)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more bready malts upfront. Cracker, bread, and then follows into a Belgian spices of clove and banana. This linger and provides a tart and spicy pepper astringency before it finishes with a sweet, almost candied malt finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finishes soft on the palate.

Compared to Boulevard's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale 4/16/21: Pours a more orange color with a milder head. More bready, clove, and banana malts. Less fruit, citrus, coriander, and yeast. Winner: Tank 7

Overall: A pretty good farmhouse ale/sasion. I wanted to see how this one compared to one of my favorite saisons, which is Tank 7. I think I prefer the Tank 7. This is a decent beer, but as other have mentioned its leans more malty, bready, and sweet. The clove, banana, and pepper spice show here.

Smell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove, ""spicy"" [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of ""fresh"" [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, & Berliners. Just better than the usual.

Taste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, & leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, & slightly stripped.

Overall, as you might guess, I am astounded & enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , & could use 3-4 more months on it. If memory serves, I'd give the ""Taste"" rating another +.25, in that ideal state. ('Course, that might just have been the abv X [#beers] being the voices in my head. ;) In any event, if you haven't tried this, please, do yourself a favor, & go for it. (& for Dog's sake, don't drink it ice-cold - let it warm up to 45-50F , or so. :) )"
Popular,Hennepin,3.68,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a thick white head. Funky aromas. Sharp carbonation and medium to heavy bodied. There’s a good saison flavor under there, but it’s masked a bit by the coriander and ginger. Maybe it’s just a personal flavor preference, but these flavors just don’t quite seem to go with the style."
Popular,Hennepin,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stem glass.
Strong 2-finger head when poured. Some decent lacing on the glass and nice lingering thin head on beer while drinking it down.
Strong copper color filled with carbonation bubbling to the top to keep that thin head going.
Coriander and spice right away invite you to take a drink.
Sparkling mouthfeel as soon as you take a drink and that smooths out at the end.
As described on Omegang's website, you can taste the coriander, spice, and orange peel for a really delightful beer drinking experience.
Overall, this is everything you want in a 'traditional' Saison- I fell in love with everything Omegang brewed years ago when Belgian beers became popular. It's so nice to revisit an old friend and put up a review on ba. I strongly recommend this beer any time of the year. I can't wait to try Omegang's newer offerings!"
Popular,Hennepin,4.64,"I received a case of 750ml bottles for my wedding 21 years ago.
We drank one on our 10th year anniversary.

I still have 2 bottles left cellaring.
Don't know when or if I'll ever open them.
Great beer!"
Popular,Hennepin,4.06,"Nice golden color, thick head, nice lacing. Smells sour, fermented wheat. Smell throws you off, it tastes nothing like it smells. Very smooth. Notes of orange, barley, spices, ginger. Nothing too pronounced, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with medium-light viscosity. Overall, it doesn't smell good but it excels in most other categories. Excellent brew"
Popular,Hennepin,4.46,"This beer has a beautiful, rich taste on poor. It has a succulent, foamy head with a light amber color. The aroma is not all that apparent. However, the taste is really good. It's crisp and refreshing, especially during a pandemic on a hot, humid day in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I don't smell or taste much in the way of orange peel or the coriander. However, the coriander taste is subtle but clearly there. This beer is refreshing. Even with a 6.5% ABV it's not heavy. A must true."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.83,Stellar example of a modern west coast IPA from one of California's premier breweries. Every time I have one of these I am reminded of why this is my favorite style of beer.
Popular,Blind Pig,4.06,"This is a very well balanced IPA. It showcases its hop’s like all IPAs do. Both the West Coast Pine notes and East Coast Citrus are present in your first and last sip. It hides its > 6% ABV well, making the drinker believe that it is sessionable."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.46,"510 ml (1 pint, 1.25 ounce) bottle, bottled on 06/10/22. Served in a Spiegelau IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stuck around for a very long time. Lots of lacing, too. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like grapefruit, orange, pine, bready malt and some floralness. I think the taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but with a little more kick and the addition of some citrus peel, grassy and earthy flavors. Nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. I wish more IPA's were like Blind Pig, I'd buy this quite a bit if I could get it around here. Thanks to one of my Instagram buddies for sending me this, it was a great surprise!"
Popular,Blind Pig,4.3,"Well. Tried this today after two days of drinking Pliny’s.
Not as nice, but still very good. Different.
Golden to orange look. Nice white foamy head with good lacing.
Aroma is citrus and pine-maybe woody like the label says.
I taste the pine, the citrus and the hops. None of those tastes overpowering though. Very astringent mouthfeel but with a decent amount of carbonation.
Overall very nice. Probably not as nice as Pliny, but still very good. Happy I tried it. I’ll have another."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.23,"Russian River Blind Pig IPA, 6.25% ABV. Pours clear golden, with a 4+ finger off-white head that left lots of foamy lacing. Nose is citrus and fruit. Taste is piney with fruit, quite bitter. Decent mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall excellent to outstanding-adjacent."

Popular,Blind Pig,4.06,"First timer on Blind Pig. My only complaint is that there is a piney aftertaste that, for me, hung in my mouth longer than I was OK with. I would certainly buy another one but with a full knowledge that there was a lingering aftertaste. I would have loved to have tried it on draft but I was just in SF for a few hours from a cruise and was just happy to get one Blind Pig and 3 Pliny’s."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.56,"Brief Review:

O: First time trying Blind Pig, this beer has been around a while. Despite the West Coast IPA being out of style, this one isn’t too bad. Very light and drinkable, dry finish. Almost sessionable in a way. I’ve definitely had similar beers along the way, but it’s nice to have an OG this tasty.

Recommendation: Easy to get if you’re ever on the West Coast, it’s definitely a must-try if you’re out there."
Popular,Blind Pig,3.28,Beautiful to look at and smell but the flavors in the nose aren't in the taste. Hoppiness too overpowering to enjoy. There are more sophisticated IPAs to be had.
Popular,Blind Pig,4.53,"Canned Feb 21 2022, enjoyed Mar 20, 2022. So about a month old. Received from @JayORear in an LIF from NBW BIF #14.
Poured honey color amber and quite transparent, capped with a short near white head and active carbonation continues throughout.
The aroma was mild for me; but my nose id damaged from chemical foolishness (Really, when a liquid recommends that you use a respirator when using it, USE a frickin' respirator!)
The taste was a surprise. Russian River IPA, WC all the way, right? It's like they took a page from Bell's Two Hearted and balanced the malts in with the hops. That piney dominance I expected wasn't there, but it existed in harmony with other flavors; floral, doughy, herbal, etc. Not what i expected but still really tasty.
The feel? With the active carbonation, this checked all the boxes in the regards to feel.
OA, one I've been wanting to try a long time and finally got the chance. It's not what I expected but it's really good in an unexpected way."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.01,"Pours a clear darker gold beautiful creamy dense white head, great lacing and retention.

An excellent balanced IPA with nice malt and bitter hop balance, a citrus and pine treat."
Popular,Blind Pig,4.49,Very bright and citrusy nose with a slight pine. Very nice bite with a quick hit of pine and ending with a citrusy bitterness. Kinda the opposite of Pliny which I found to be more pine dank aftertaste. Its definitely the younger brother of pliny but its still amazing. Definitely has the same elements in it just not as much. Would definitely buy again.

Thanks to Donald for this surprise box!

Mostly clear gold but with a little chill haze, and a classic west coast head; bone white at 2 fingers, leaving gorgeous lace destroying the glass as it recedes gradually.

Aroma brings forward slight papery oxidation, with slight onion skin, dusty pine flooring, grapefruit rind, and dead hop leaves. I do not detect any yeast, malt, or ethanol in this beer. It is cutting and dirty and bitter smelling. It's a change from what I'm used to, but also brings me back to when IPAs were all emulating the giants like RR.

Flavor doesn't hit until about mid-palate. When that happens it brings sawdust first, then a little evergreen, then some onion skin, a tiny presence of crisp caramel malt, and then some papery oxidation. After you swallow it however, the flavor really shines. It sticks to your tongue and cheeks and roof, and sucks all moisture out. Then, seemingly suddenly, a wave of resiny bitterness and sweet honey take over and the oils take hold, pounding your palate with lupulin gland again and again. The finish is literally 10x as long as the beer itself, and takes time to dry on your palate. Then a whole new world opens up.

Feel is resiny, oily, very carbonated, with no alcohol anywhere in sight. Palate punisher, this one, as the oils destroy and scrub every taste bud from your mouth.

Overall, an impressive one to be sure, and it's easy to write paragraphs about it. This is one that should be in the books (and probably is), right along side its cousin Pliny, and has every right to be studied and emulated. This is a true west coast IPA in every sense of the word.

Exemplary."
Popular,Blind Pig,3.97,"Looks literally exactly the same as Pliny the Elder (had them side by side): beautiful, crystal-clear, light-amber-gold, with a big and pillowy head of bright white bubbles. Lots of splotches and streaks of lacing down the glass. Great looking beer. After that, the experience is very much like a muted and somewhat watered-down Pliny — some nice notes and well-crafted, but not really a standout. Piney, bright, citrusy, with solid bitterness, a lot of grassiness, some soapiness, and a touch of malt-sweetness. West Coast IPA all the way, with heavy grapefruit, but boarding on APA (for me) in terms of aroma and taste profile.

Crisp and refreshing but not particularly noteworthy."
Popular,Golden Monkey,3.88,"From the bottom of the can: ""BEST BY JUL 13 24 PBG 22194 14:38 FL""

Appearance: The body is a pretty medium shade of gold. It has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. The head is massive, creamy textured, and slightly off-white with a bit of an eggshell appearance. It has very good head retention and very nice sheets of creamy lacing on the glass.

Aroma: There is a bit of a banana aroma to the beer with a touch of an old paper scent. After the glass is agitated a bit there is a hint of a white pepper character that comes through.

Taste: Up front there is banana and a light bit of coriander. Towards the middle of the mouth there is a very light touch of clove mixed with more of that banana flavor. It has a very mellow sweetness that is balanced well with the beer. The flavor doesn't transform to the back of the mouth or in the aftertaste and stays mostly banana with a light hint of clove at times.

Mouthfeel: It is very smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation feels a little on the light side but the body of the beer still feels great. It has very high drinkability and it hides the alcohol well.

Overall: It is a really well made beer. The can states that this has a ""Belgian yeast character of banana and clove"" and they really hit the nail on the head with that description. The beer has a pleasant banana flavor with just a light touch of perceived sweetness that feels balanced. It is enjoyable to drink. I would recommend it and I would buy it again."
Popular,Golden Monkey,4.1,"Surprisingly good American take on a Tripel. Purchased a six pack of 12oz bottles and sampling in a tulip glass.

Allowed bottle to warm to 50F before pouring. Little to no head and very little lacing. On the nose, I am getting faint bananas and cloves with a background note of caramel. Taste is actually very yeast and malt forward, with a higher-than-usual sweetness and a clean lighter hop finish (Tettnang, maybe?). Subdued, but present, alcohol taste, which is not out of place for the style. Some black pepper notes on the tongue, which is present in my favorite Belgians.

It is the mouthfeel that throws it off, for me. For the style, it feels much thinner than I expected. If it was not so thin, I think that it would drink a little slower. Somehow, this is an almost crushable tripel, which is just as dangerous as it sounds. Allowing this to sit in the glass and warm up a bit, it becomes more balanced, and I get some slightly floral notes and a slightly improved mouthfeel.

Honestly, for the price, it exceeded expectations. I would have no problem buying it again, although I would not say it is the best in the style. However, it might be my favorite of American tripels, so far."
Popular,Golden Monkey,3.57,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A 1"" off white head drops slowly, no lacing. Color is golden amber. Aroma of banana, clove and other spices. Mouthfeel is medium with dry finish. Flavor bursts with clove, allspice, earthy hops, yeast rolls. Overall: lots of flavor but not necessarily a situation of more=better. It's very good but not excellent. I probably would not buy this particular tripel again for that reason."
Popular,Golden Monkey,4.05,"October 9th, 2016 - A classic, but well worth reviewing again. Those Belgian esters hit softly but with definition, coaxing the olfactory with pear, banana (peel) and clove, with a richness that is intoxicating. The flavor is even better, translating those esters into a chorus of fruit flavors, and some nice spicy garnishes. I find pear, cinnamon and custard, with a little pepper for an unexpected kick. There's a reason this has been around for so long. Here's to hoping it's around in another decade."
Popular,Golden Monkey,4.4,"Tried this beer on a recommendation from a friend who originally sent me some Victory Beer in a beer box. To me, it tastes great and the ABV is in the mid-upper range that I like to start with.
Definitely One of my favorites."
Popular,Golden Monkey,3.74,"Fairly light head. Smell is sweet; banana and bubblegum, esters, coriander, cloves. Taste follows; sweet slightly caramel malt, banana, a hint of orange peel and citrus hops, becoming bubblegum and fruit esters, finishing with plenty of cloves and coriander. The alcohol is quite present; finish is dry. Not bad, but a bit too sweet and too reliant on the presence of spices for me."

not a bad tripel for the price"
Popular,Golden Monkey,4.52,"Originally when I had my first Golden Monkey it was in a Victory mix pack. That mix pack had hop devil, prima pils, another victory beer I can't remember and golden monkey. I remember dreading having to drink Golden Monkey and would often split it with someone rather than waste it. The bottom line, I was out of touch with the world of Belgian style beers. Long story short, over time, Golden Monkey ascended to one of my favorite styles. This is a clean, spicy, and dry finish beer that leaves you with a warm happiness."

Oh man, how the hell have I never reviewed this one? This was a big one that pulled me into craft before my legal drinking days. I would also wager that it was my first Belgian-esque beer, but I can’t say for sure. Enough talk, rime for a proper review of this classic

Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

There’s not a whole lot going on in the nose, just a nice balance of spice and fruit. I’m picking up on aromas of clove, overripe banana, white pepper, orange rind, and bready malt

There’s a bit more going on in taste, and it’s a bit sweeter than the aroma especially on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, white pepper, grassy hops, crackery malt, banana, and light coriander. The swallow brings notes of candi sugar, toffee, clove, overripe banana, bready malt, apple skin, and orange rind

A medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer with a bit of bite. Finishes neutral but a bit too sweet

This is a good beer, but after years it pales in comparison to other Tripels and Belgian beers in general. Still, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one"

Popular,Storm King,3.94,"Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King."

Popular,Storm King,4.37,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste.
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout."

Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back.

So this is one of those classic beers that everyone in the forums talks about quite often. All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Upon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee

Oof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer. Finishes mostly dry with a huge roast character

This beer is definitely a product of the time when it was popular, and it's pretty damn good for that. Drinks easy for what it is"
Popular,Storm King,4.24,"So this stout is very interesting to me, since it uses European malts and American hops. I read some reviews about this stout that were much older, stating that it tasted more like a black IPA than a stout, but I disagree with this assessment. It tastes like a European imperial stout to me, with cocoa, slight coffee, a bit of bread, and a little bit of a hop bite, but really can't tell that the hops create any outstanding bitterness. Certainly not a thin beer, but certainly not the thickets beer I've ever had, and quite dry on the aftertaste.. I really enjoy it, but it's not as good when warm as some other thicker stouts. Overall, great stout, but better when served up slightly on the cold side. If you want something to drink at room temp, this probably isn't it."

Popular,Storm King,3.93,"Appearance:
The type of brown called to mind by an untamed forest, thick with brawny tree trunks, swallowed up in the darkness of its own, impermeable canopy; nightfall immersing it in sightless black. Oh, it has a head too… Right. Got a little carried away there. It’s a lush, wonderful head of pale, sandy froth with long-lived retention and lace that starts as a sheet, then breaks into cobwebs.

Bouquet:
Smoked oats, coated in a chocolate that’s never even heard the word “sugar,” let alone mixed with it. The backend yields dark malts and miniscule, earthy hops, pulverized into powdery dryness.

Feel:
So plush and thick, it’s like chewing on a satin quilt—but in this case, pretend the quilt is edible and chewing on it is not the result of mental derangement. A weave on low carbonation provides a bit of fiber-like contrast to the texture… Hmm, I’m not really selling you here, am I? Look, its good okay. Full bodied and smokier than a volcanic plume. Drink it and instantly gain +100 Manly Points.

Taste:
A billowing cloud of woodsmoke engulfs the palate, leaving the tongue to blindly trip over dark, earthy hops, bang its shins on blocks of raw cacao, and fall, gratefully, onto a pillow of soft oats at the end."
Popular,Storm King,4.12,"From a 12oz bottle dated best by 10/7/22 into a pint glass.

Pours an opaque black with about two and a half fingers of tan head. Great retention, great lacing.

Smells mainly of roasted/smoky malts with a hint of coffee and baker's chocolate.

Taste is bitter dark chocolate with strong roasty/smoky notes. Touch of coffee in there too.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but still pretty full-bodied. This is a different kind of IS than the RISs I'm used to. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Low to medium carbonation.

This is really a decent beer. A little different than what I'm used to but a great change of pace. Glad Victory brought this one back."
Popular,Storm King,4.92,"Perfection incarnate for me. This is exceptional - seriously. I think one of my favorite beers has to be Alchemist's Luscious. I don't get up to VT more than once (maybe twice) a year. I have a couple stowed away to enjoy this holiday season from a summer trip - I love that stuff but this is so reminiscent. Stylistically, profile, aesthetic. It's quite a surprise for me. What I'm trying to say is, this to me fills the luscious void in a sense. Price point is excellent as well. Man, what a beer. Big, bold, bitter, luscious stuff. I suspect there's something of cascade in here - that hop just becomes what you need it to. I dunno, this is wonderful stuff though. Grab it."
Popular,Storm King,4.25,"L: Jet black body with a finger of brown head.
S: aromas of coffee, espresso, hazelnut, and roasted nuts
T: big time coffee/espresso notes, followed by a nice hop finish with a touch of bitterness
F: slightly creamy, medium body
O: outstanding, underrated in my opinion"
Popular,Storm King,4.31,"pours a deep cola brown-near-black body with a tan foam head that has low retention and leaves occasional thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin murky cap with occasional thick bubbles and a thick defined halo

aroma is clear, thick and rich molasses sweetness with thin licorice herbal hop and mocha

taste is espresso with dark fruit underpinnings and that herbal licorice tinged hop; dark chocolate is kinda buried here but in there with the roasted malt; resinous pine underlying

mouthfeel is somewhat thin bodied with robust carbonation; comes across like carbonated espresso with pillowy bitter prickles throughout and a dry, hopped finish with an herbal, licorice tinged hop and robust dark chocolate and espresso aftertaste

overall:
straight up carbonated espresso beer. pretty great and somewhat complicated and tinged with resinous pine and lowkey herb. pretty great overall, but lacking balance"
Popular,Storm King,2.55,"I’m not sure how this beer gets such a high rating. Ether I’m wrong and need to study beer more to understand it or everyone else is wrong. Or I can just simply have a different opinion which is probably the case. We will go with the last one I guess. I get nothing on the nose other than a slight burnt toast scent. The taste is of burnt soap or a semi cheep cup of coffee. Mouth feel seems non existent. I think Victory can do better than this by a long shot.

After I wrote what I said above, I saw a comment below saying that it is more of a black lager and yes!!! That’s it!! The post even said if it is a black lager than it is a good black lager! This is indeed a wonderful black lager and not a stout. Shame they call it a stout. It is the hops that add too much of a bitterness for a stout without the maltiness, yet for a black lager it is perfect.

Strange how names can make all the difference."
Popular,Storm King,4.71,"Imperial stout 9.1 abv with relatively high IBU at 65. This is a style of imperial stout I really enjoy, and it shares the heritage of North Coast's venerable Old Rasputin. Glad I found this one. Bought a 6-pack of 12-Oz bottles and went back for the case. In PA this one is $40 per case of 25 or $10.49/6-pack, and an exceptional deal. Appearance: Black, tan head, good lacing. Taste: Strong coffee, caramel, malts, balanced bitterness to offset the stout sweetness and clean finish. No alcohol heat or odor, so be careful with this one. It's a seasonal favorite."

S---Sweet & fruity. Orange, pineapple, mango. Floral notes.

T---Follows the nose, but not as strong. Floral & fruity flavors abound.

F---Dry & crisp. Kind of red wine like.

O---An excellent one. If I knew how good it is, I would've bought more than one."
Popular,Sip Of Sunshine,4.57,"This is a marvelous DIPA!!!! As good as any I have tried. Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass this beer featured a medium sized bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly and plenty of lacing on the glass. Beautiful, almost clear, orange/light copper color. Aroma and taste are wonderful. Like Heady Topper, the aroma bursts out the second you open the can - mostly floral hops and some tropical fruit. The taste features floral hops as well but there is more piney hops than the nose would indicate. There is some balance with rye or sourdough bready malt but hops rule here. There is a strong and welcome bitterness to this beer - more complex than a simple hop bomb - but bitter enough to satisfy any hophead. Mouthfeel is bitter, crisp and features a richness associated with the malt. Easily one of the best beers I have ever experienced."

Popular,Sip Of Sunshine,4.93,"My last Sip of Sunshine I brought back from Smuggler's Notch. Such a tremendous IPA! Has a wonderful aroma of hops and tropical fruit. Taste is tropical, fruity, & lupulin hoppiness. This is a top level brew that should be sold & enjoyed in Florida. LOL! I wish."
Popular,Sip Of Sunshine,4.31,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous transparent orange with plenty of white head. Tons of lacing after the head recedes. Tiny bubbles throughout the glass that persist. Looks fantastic!

The nose is incredible. Oranges, apple pie, mango, pineapple, grass, a touch of honey, and a really nice hoppy layer at the end. This is definitely a wonderful tropical fruit nose. Juicy.

The taste nicely follows the nose. Tropical fruit is definitely there on impact, but nothing like the nose. The middle region and aftertaste are clearly bitter hops. Dank. Citrus peel. Leather, sourdough bread, and a strong earthy note.

Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Love it."
Popular,Sip Of Sunshine,4.5,"Rich, golden amber body; nice carbonation; thick head, dense, white, semi-creamy.

Popular,Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,5,"I’m very impressed with Stone for this one—most Stone IPAs have the same exact generic bitterness; however, this one is different; this one has a balanced hop flavor, balanced bitterness, and is oh-so-smooth. Pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in, yet looks basically black poured into a glass. Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed. Nice work on a unique brew, Stone. Try it while you can as it is a limited re-release."

Aroma was actually hoppy for me, which was surprising as most black “IPAs” are more malty than hoppy.

Feel is excellent too, almost crushable in mouth feel, very crisp like almost.
Glad I finally found one to try, I’ll be on the lookout."

12 oz. can dated 12/22/21 - 8.7% ABV / 90 IBU
Brewed and canned in Richmond, VA
Poured into a Bell's branded tulip snifter glass

Look - Pours a thick and dense light tan head that leaves lacing. Pitch black appearance with small amounts of light coming through revealing a reddish hue.
Smell - Not getting much aroma from the beer while it's cold. Maybe some toasted malt. As the beer warms, there's the scent of pine, grapefruit, coffee, and faint dark fruit coming forth.
Taste - Initial taste is charred malt and pine that brings a nice bitterness. Getting light chocolate and citrus flavors as the beer warms. Also getting dark fruit and berry qualities. Can't detect any alcohol flavor.
Feel - Medium bodied with a sharp mouthfeel and you can feel the booze burn on the back of the tongue. Has a fairly dry finish.
Overall - Nice hop flavors that balance well with the smoky malt. Easy to drink despite the high ABV."

Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"Im sampling this 12 oz bottle at cellar temp poured into my snifter. This bottle is about 7 years old and has been in my cellar for most of its life. The beer pours black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. Very minimal tan head foams up and remains a thin edge layer throughout sampling. I leave maybe a ml in the bottle as there are some sediment chunks that Im not interested in.
The aroma is rich and complex malt profile. I get brown sugar, some vanilla, and rich woody notes. I also get a little booze and hints of port in the background. I also do get just a wisp of oxidation cardboard buried. glad I opened now and not next year!
First sip reveals a medium body with mild yet still slightly tingly carbonation. Texture is definitely sticky and coats my lips and palate with each sip. Flavor is deep malt with brown sugar, some tobacco, dark cocoa powder, and wood. Finish actually also has a little dark fruit and some booze. No hop character anywhere and I dont get any oxidation on the flavor profile. I do find this to be a sipping beer due to the texture and slight booziness on the finish. Interesting and enjoyable, but I need to go back and get a fresh bottle to remind myself of what it tastes like without aging."

Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.81,"Instead of the strict five point review format, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.

This beer is and in-depth, syrupy mouthful of deliciousness, especially when comparing it to your average pint of not-nearly-as-heavy brown ale. I bought a 4 pack of bottles on a trip (bottled 10/09/20, drinking it on 1/8 and drinking it at whatever appropriate temperature for this type of beer, fuck fussing about degrees F) and it's an excellent beer. Very little noticeable carbonation and all of those dank, roasty, delicious flavors I love in a brown ale whether exceptionally heavy or as light as newcastle.

For sure, worth an excellent review in my eyes"
Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.44,"It smells like a sweet steaming loaf of decadent brown bread on some exotic wooden cutting board with a bottle of smokeless scotch opened just next to it.

It has the taste of a ball of dough rolled in rich and bitter cocoa nibs. Once that slightly fades you can taste some wood that a little alcohol has been spilled on.

It feels smooth like hot cocoa down to the fact that it warms your mouth with the high alcohol content. Mild carbonation prickles a little and when you swallow you're left with a dry and clean bitterness.

Overall it's really interesting. I like it and it's unique. I give it a 5.3 out of 6."
Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"Deep brown appearance with a large, dense, tan head and good lacing. Aroma is a mix of molasses, chocolate and vanilla extract over the wood.

smell: one of the best parts. the palo santo marron wood of course gives it some woody scent (redwood? rosemary?), but also a very savory char. like a BBQ smoker

taste: soy sauce, barbecue sauce, salami, rosemary, thyme, sage. i can't get over how savory this is. i don't even get a ton of acutal oak or wood, it just tastes like someone stacked their smoker with some very tasty wood, and made a bunch of meat. it's not a campfire beer, it's a barbecue beer, in that it tastes like a whole meal

Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.2,"Bottles 4/24/20

I actually set one of these aside in the cellar before drinking a freah one, pretty sure it’s a 2019 and I plan on drinking it next year for my college graduation

Pours a rich dark brown with a finger of khaki head that reduces to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, and light milk chocolate. Really just a touch of oak but nothing spectacular

The taste starts off charred, more roasty like a stout. Some intense vanilla and rich malt with dark roast coffee. The milk chocolate comes out on the finish

Quite the light feel for a brown but still full in flavor with moderate carbonation leads to a smooth and nearly dry finish

This was not exactly what I was expecting, I wanted my mind to be blown. I guess that ones on me, but I’ve heard it gets better with age. I’ll have to set aside other beers for graduation too, but this will be nice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the day has finally come. I graduated from college with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering earlier today (okay, yesterday really) and now it's time to whip out a bottle of this I've had for a while dated 4/12/19. Let's dive right in

Still looking the same in color but with a slightly bigger head and more lacing (3.75->4)

Holy hell, the wood in this older bottle is significantly more present. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25->4.5)

Honestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4->4)

The body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4->4.25)

Overall this has to go (4->4.25). This definitely impressed me more than it did initially, but I think setting another bottle aside would be fun to see how the taste evolves"

It's a great beer for someone who has been dabbling in the waters of craft brewing and enjoys darker, sweeter beers!"
Popular,Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"This brewery, they do as they please, because they’re established and have the following to do so. I personally commend them for making beer that nobody else would. With that being said sometimes it’s too over the top and that’s the case with this brown ale. I’ve never seen a Brown Ale with such a high ABV. It’s too over powering and doesn’t drink like any brown ale I’ve had. Honestly if they toned this down a bit , could be a really amazing brown. Worth a try but not high on my repeat list."
Popular,Lunch,3.95,"Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, frothy white head with very good retention.

Aroma: Tropical fruit and berry. Not aromas we quite muted, got no citrus or pine.

Flavor: Hop forward, flavor follows aroma. Moderate bitterness

Mouth feel: Medium body, creamy smooth.

Overall: I was actually a little disappointed, but this sample was about 3 months old. Aromas and flavors were more muted than I expected. I got berry and tropical fruit but very little citrus and no pine per the description. It can be hard to find Maine Beer Co in my area that is less than 60 days old unless you just get lucky. While it did not live up to the hype, I enjoyed this more than most IPA's because the bitterness balanced sweetness well, didn't overwhelm and destroy the palate. It has a nice creamy, smooth mouth-feel. 7% abv is very well hidden, would not know it is that high. Enjoyable beer, but was very overpriced for what I got. Based on price/enjoyment I would not purchase again simply because it is expensive."

Feel is on the light side of medium, smooth, medium bubbles.
Overall, good fresh beer, price point is OK, this is a simple and unpretentious glass of good."
Popular,Lunch,4.43,"An easy pour from a 1 Pint .9FL. OZ. bottle released a fat finger of creamy white foam with long retention and thin rings of lacing. Translucent dark yellow straw color appears golden in bright light.

Citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine greets the nose, toast and cracker in the background. Somewhat dank, hints at being sweet.

Semi-dry with medium-high bitterness, malty and juicy-but not too juicy. Lemon and grass are added to the hop profile, a Kolsch-like wine and grape flavor emerges. A hint of caramel and toasted grain joins the malt. The finish is fast with malt and juice flavor dropping off, citrus and piney hops with a peppery bite linger a while.

Medium light bodied with ample carbonation, boldly flavored yet balanced and smooth. Alcohol is cleverly hidden.
True to style with clean and fresh taste. Born on date 31MAY22, 69 days old."

Popular,Lunch,4.15,"This is a good beer and I adore Maine beers in general. Truth be told I think Portland has a dozen beers better than Lunch, so I think it is slightly overrated, but that said it is definitely quality so give it a try."
Popular,Lunch,4.2,"500ml bottle, about a month old

Pours two massive fingers of fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is pretty good, and half a finger of head remains after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks pretty nice. Body is a hazy orange, with a hefty amount of bubbles coming up. Looks pretty good so far.

Nose is pretty tame - citrus rind, mandarin oranges, some sweetness. The orange comes out a little more with heavy agitation. Smells good enough.

The flavor is not much different. Light citrus, some orange.

That said, the mouthfeel completely transforms this beer. Carbonation is on the higher side. Body is somewhat light - drinks much lighter than 7%. A very small touch of sweetness; finishes very clean. Bitterness is medium. This is crisp, wet, and incredibly refreshing. Outstanding mouthfeel.

Drinkability is off the charts good.

Appearance turned out pretty nice. Lacing was cohesive for the most part, and some foam hung around to the bottom.

This feels like a pale ale that got crossed between the east and west coast. Has the look of an east coast, crispness of a west coast, and weight of a pale. On its own, the flavor is ok, but the mouthfeel really accentuates and elevates that. Very nice beer."
Popular,Lunch,4.46,"From the bottle's neck, it smells like an IPA but more nuanced. Like hoppy bubble gum. Pours a bright amber color with a large, long, retainful off-white head.
Very smooth, hoppy, malty, and refreshing. Candied hops and sweet malts. Occasionally bitter resin notes come out and are soon overridden by its general smoothness. The tropical notes take a bit more of a back seat, but they're there, particularly with some orange rind, melon, with the addition of some slightly herbal or peppery notes. Well carbonated till the end. The only thing I can compare it to is Pliny the Elder. Good beer, I would definitely enjoy again."
Popular,Lunch,4.28,"16.9oz bottle purchased off the shelf for $6.99 (on sale for $1 off) plus a 5 cent deposit and 8.62% sales tax. Bottled on 7/14/22, so this is exactly one month old.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a translucent haze. There was a thick, off-white head with compact to medium bubbles that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: Aromas of tropical fruit (papaya), stone fruit (apricot, mango), citrus (grapefruit), and pine. Unmistakable green bell pepper aroma. I also get an interesting creamy vanilla note on the nose.

Taste: This is extremely drinkable. This beer has a nice caramel malt backbone to complement the hoppiness. It has a dry finish, which is mild to moderately bitter. The bitterness does not linger on the palate for so long. The finish also has a nice orange zest note along with some spiciness. Pine resin on the finish as well.

Feel: Medium bodied with a very soft mouthfeel. Appropriately carbonated.

Overall: Maine Beer Company does it again. They know how to make very tasty beer!

Popular,Lunch,4.08,"On tap at Habitap in Greenville SC.

Appearance. Slightly hazy amber colored body with a decent white head.

Enticing aroma with a notable note of caramel. Caramel is much more subtle in the hoppy flavor."
Popular,Lunch,4.4,"""Drink 90 days from born on date,"" the label said. 31May22. Fresh. Poured into a Rastal Teku glass. The clean design of the white label dictated that.
Aroma was grassy and orange citrusy. It poured a half-finger head of a classical pianist's finger.
The taste followed the scent: grassy with an orange rind taste. Not too at all.
Nice color. A light golden, slightly hazy.
Light mouthfeel. Very easy-going and sippable."
Popular,Lunch,4.19,"Went to our newest wine store in town, couldn’t believe they had it, and was the last one! This is a very easy drinking IPA. Seems like a West Coast and New England had a baby. Just a little bit of hops and pine but nothing overpowering. Same goes for the fruitiness. Not the best IPA but prob a very good one to start new drinkers with….if you can find it!"
Popular,Lunch,4.67,"Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into proper pint glass. Stamped 14DEC21 (best within 90 days…which was about 3 months ago).
A: Pours a clear dark golden yellow hue with 2-3 inch frothy white head with excellent retention.
S: Honeyed melon, white grape, dank grass, subtle tangerine, pine, and cracker malt.
T: Dank grass, honeyed melon, white grape, white pepper, soft and bitter pine resin, tangerine, dry cracker malt, and subtle lemon, earthy, and floral notes. Nice complexity!
M: Light body. Dry throughout with citrus and other fruit sweetness, mildly bitter with subtle earthy and spice elements. Delicate cracker malt backbone. Excellent balance!
D: Wow! What an outstanding APA/IPA (seems to sit right on the border between the two). Superb for style."
Popular,Lunch,3.92,"Appearance: Yellow/Blonde glass with serious chill haze. Holds a halo of white foam that leaves a few wisps of lace.

Aroma: Lemongrass hop note, some crystal malt base, mild overall.

Taste: Gentle profile, light slightly earthy, slightly pine hop bitterness blends with a full malt base, slight perfume floral note, little tonic water finish.

Mouthfeel: Slight grit in a silky base, medium heavy carbonation, medium body.

Overall: A little underwhelmed given the big scores it gets. It's a fine beer, just very East Coast in my book. Hops just didn't pop, not nearly citric enough for me, leaving this more of an APA ranged beer. It shipped from Virginia, arrived very warm, that might have taken some of the bloom off of the hops, I'd be happy to try again but I don't see the bones of a great whale here. Still a good catch."
Popular,Lunch,4.44,"Poured from a bottle into my tulip glass.

Look: Pretty dark straw head with a thick foamy head. Body itself is crisp but also has slightest tinge of haze.

Smell: Pine, candied orange.

Taste: Orange hops, Some vegetal/grassy notes, even slight onion mid palate. Some graham cracker malt (think honeyed Teddy grahams). Dank pine and grapefruit, sight peppery alcoholic finish. Hoppy but very well balanced.

Feel: Medium bodied, very drinkable.

Drinking a 2 week old Lunch is one of the more pleasant beer experiences I've had in a while. Would love to try this on tap. Awesome beer, well worth seeking out."
Popular,Lunch,4.39,"A crisp and clean NEIPA that lives up to its description as an “East Coast version of a West Coast IPA”. Reminiscent of Bell’s Two Hearted, but a little lighter in color and taste. Excellent brew!"
Popular,Brown Shugga',3.58,"Local beer store had this as a single and I took a chance. First of all, I couldn't find any dates or date codes anywhere on the bottle.

Poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head. The smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup. The flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel. A decent beer, if you like sweetness in your beers. Not my kind of beer but hey, it was a one off shot."
Popular,Brown Shugga',4,Pours a hazy amber. Thick foam. Malty aroma. Big flavors. Bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness. Light brown sugar finish. You can taste the alcohol. Complex but well balanced. An excellent strong ale.
Popular,Brown Shugga',3.25,"12oz bottle

One of my old favorites, this is a big boozy sugary drink with a decent scent and look, and dangerous drinkability. I used to get sixers of this for $8 back in college, and many a blurry night were spent in its embrace"
Popular,Brown Shugga',4.43,"A nice seasonal option when I can find it. Decent nose, goes down smooth for a heavy hitter. I hope the woke agitators dont cancel the brew's name. Reminds me of darker skinned gf's back in the day. Much respect for this ""brew of color."" lol"
Popular,Brown Shugga',3.87,"12 oz bottle pours a deep reddish-brown in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong aromas of grapefruit and caramel candy. Full bodied with a thick almost syrupy mouthfeel. Sugary, dark fruit and caramel flavor."
Popular,Brown Shugga',3.89,"Wowser, this is a pretty stout Am Strong Ale!! For me, it is is a bit overpowering with the initial bite and then the finish is a bit bitter. It is a really good beer for this style, but I cannot say that I find it to be a great beer. I know that is weak but that is just due to my taste. As always, I recommend you try this (if interested in the style) and form your own opinion."
Popular,Brown Shugga',4.02,Pours a copper color with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. No discernable aroma. Tastes of brown sugar. Starts out sweet but finishes with a hoppy bitterness.

Dark translucent copper, one finger of beige head, clumpy lacing. partial cap, variegated bubbles.
Caramel, dates, dark honey, spice cake aromas
Light hop tart orange citrus, pine, yet also brown sugar, and caramel flavors
Substantial body, alcohol noticeable, initial hop bite, but nice balance that drinks too quickly. Lingering hop tingle. Carbonation dissipates steadily but is stubborn given the ABV.
Evergreen standby in the winter months."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before.

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Clean, not overpowering taste. Rich, smooth feel. I wish I had another bottle!"
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.01,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Wilmington Brewing Company Can Glass

The beer pours nearly pitch black with only the lightest ruby highlights, and about two fingers of dense light tan head that slowly recedes into a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a minimal amount of lacing

The aroma is dark & milk chocolate, coffee, and some roasted malts. Very pleasant and inviting.

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The chocolate is complimented with the roasted malts. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and more pronounced milk chocolate flavors. Light/medium bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, that is very smooth and easy to drink. Quite enjoyable"

Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.9,"Pours a very deep, dark brown. The look is black, but held to a light you can see the deep ruby shades going through. No beer so far that’s been nitro’d has the ability to pour as big a nitro head as Guinness — but Young’s comes very close, with a thick, dense finger tall head that looks a little more watery and a little more creamy than other nitro stouts. Hard to ever rate nitro beers low on the looks department.

Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, chocolate dust, cacao beans, roasted coffee, caramelized sugar in sticky toffee pudding, and light burnt and toasty malts. What can you say? It’s good!

Taste follows the nose, but is regrettably more watery with a thinner body than the nose suggests. They do not lie about the chocolate, dark chocolate intermingles with milk chocolate on the finish, which is a bit sweeter. Gentle bitterness from the roasted malt on the front. Earthy with a nice almond-esque nuttiness throughout.

Based on the style I’m almost tempted to say this is a lighter bodied stout but I’d say it’s square in the medium bodied category. This is straight up nitrogenated, there is barely even a tickle of the tiny bubbles on the palate. Not quite flat, however, this creates a very very smooth mouthfeel. As smooth as you can possibly get, even more than other nitro stouts. Semi-dry finish that leans to the sweet side.

I will be honest, I came into the review a little disappointed. I am used to Young’s like the picture on BA, the nice dark glass in the regular carbonation. Ironically, I actually love nitro stouts. But years ago when I first started drinking good beers, I loved to split Young’s with a friend. One of the first real chocolate stouts on the market, and it was so good. Not sure if I’ll ever find a bottled one again.

That all being said, this was still not bad. You sacrifice certain aspects and bolder flavours for the smoother ride of the nitro when you go for the widget can. This is still a remarkable beer, one that is actually pretty easy drinking for people used to stouts and nitros. Could easily have a few in a night. The flavours are subtle but varied and complex enough to make a great beer."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black, color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 22-23. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of English cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa nibs, some earthy black malts. Smooth lactose. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. Some tobacco & smoke. This smooths into a milk chocolate, dark malt, and creamy lactose on the end. (3.75)

Feel: Lighter bodied. Low carbonation. Drinks sort of flat with tobacco bitterness and cocoa lingering on the finish. (3.50)

Compared to Founders' Porter 3/7/22: Pours a similar color, milder and lighter head. Milder aromas. More bittersweet chocolate, tobacco bitterness. Less chocolate, espresso, lactose. Lighter body.

Overall: An English Stout for sure with the bittersweet chocolate and tobacco notes intermixed with the chocolate. Lighter-bodied and under-carbonated in my opinion. Has the English flavors, but that was about the only thing I found enlightening about this beer. (Final Rating: 3.73)"
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.8,"4pk of 12oz bottles (Best before 23 JAN22) picked up at the Arundel Preserve Wine and Spirit: Hesitated a long time prior to trying this, ""Double Chocolate"" sounded like way too much chocolate. Frankly, could barely smell it and even that might have been ""peer pressure"". More, but thankfully NOT overwhelming chocolate on the tongue with some malt thrown in. A smooth drinker, but I don't think I'll be coming this way again anytime soon."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.78,The pour was a very smooth dark chocolaty pour. The smell reminds me of a very strong malt chocolaty smell on the nose. The taste was actually very surprising as you could taste the malts and chocolates. Over all this stout is very unique in it's own way and I would definitely enjoy a bottle every weekend!!!
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.23,"Pours a beautiful, inviting head with aromas similar to a chocolate milk, rather than chocolate itself. On the palate, the beer is much more straight forward with a heavy blend of both milk and dark chocolate qualities and roasted malts, much to my surprise of the rather subtle aroma. Moderate carbonation with a perfect lingering finish. Extremely creamy and smooth; like a Nitro brew. The smoothest beer I've had which actually blows my mind. Beautiful combination of a strong chocolate taste without being too heavy or sweet, which comes unexpected from the much lighter aroma."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.76,"Pours jet black with a 0.5"" tan head, settling out to a solid ring, nice streaky lacing. Nose is chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and light roast. Taste is milk chocolate, a bit of bitter baking chocolate, and some deeper roast notes. Mouthfeel on the thin side, but helps avoid this from getting too heavy. Delivers noticeable chocolate flavor without becoming overly sweet or heavy. Warrants respect for its subtlety."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.03,"I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes. I was surprised it was not on draft, but perhaps it was because it was summer. Still, it was a cool and rainy day in mid-June."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.47,"Look: This was poured from widget can, so the bottle pour might be very different. Pours a rich dark brown on hair below black. Pours like a Guiness with all the seperation expected. BIg 2 finger tawny head. The head lasts forever still a finger high at 5 minutes. The head is dense and marshmellow like. Sticky as can be.

Smell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated.

Taste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness.

This beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-

Feel: Very watery up front, but it finishes with a creamy dryness."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.01,"Pours similarly to a Guinness, just a lot darker. Smells mostly like cocoa, with a slight coffee aroma. The taste is very chocolaty, and with the bitterness of the beer, its like a very dark chocolate. Like an 80% dark chocolate. The beer is extremely creamy, and creates a wonderfully pleasant feeling. The perfect carbonation for a stout. Almost smoother than a nitro brew. This beer is very good and i would highly recommend it to a fan of stouts."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.4,"Look: So dark that light can't pass through it. Like my soul :3c nice persistent foamy head
Smell: Chocolate (DUH ITS CALLED CHOCOLATE STOUT DUHHHHHHHHHH), tobacco, Bailey's
Taste: It has chocolate flavor, but is missing the creaminess that I personally associate chocolate with. Notes of malt and black coffee. Strong black coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste.
Feel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this.
Overall: One of the better stouts I have drank, but I am not much of a stout cat. Its not too dry which I like, and the flavor is not intense so it is very drinkable."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.92,"Looks great. Dark with smooth creamy head. The Widget really does its job. Scent is too weak, even taking into account the thick head. I liked the roasted slight hint of chocolate taste but I'm not a chocolate and coffee beer enjoyer. I feel for the style the chocolate could have been group out more prominent. Smooth perfect bitterness feel."
Popular,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.18,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.

Smell - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, coffee bean, earthy and leafy hops, dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig), and earthy yeast.

Taste - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, and coffee bean upfront. The earthy and leafy hops come through next followed by the dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering.

Overall - A flavourful sweet stout that delivers on all flavours. I am impressed on how velvety smooth this beer is with all the bold elements in it. A stand out in this category and deserving of a try from those that haven't sampled it yet."
Popular,Stella Artois,2.98,"Poured into a 2/3 pint glass . 4.6% UK brewed version .

Smell : Alcohol and slightly astringent

Looks :Closer to yellow than amber, a fingers width head that bubbled down completely. No lacing.

Taste : A slight sweetness that moves into a slightly too sharp bitterness that lasts long after the mouth full.

Mouth feel : Decent , not too thin or thick. Carbonation is extra fizzy , bordering on pop like.

Overall: To use a sports analogy Stella Artois is even par in golf . Nothing to be upset about , nothing great but nothing awful. You can do a lot better and a lot worse ."
Popular,Stella Artois,3.21,"Had on tap at bout time pub & grub Arvada

On arrival the head was a bit disappointing, 1 finger of bone white average bubbles, that dissipated quickly to a vague ring. Body is a golden yellow, with lazy carbonation.

Aroma is light, with some vague and not very present euro bittering hops and a light light pale crackery malt. Very clean however.

Taste is once again pretty light but malts do come through clearly as malts, with just a bit of corniness. A light but clean and floral hop bitterness is present, but once again pretty light. There are some light esters in the mix, but I can't pinpoint quite weather it's off or just a quirk.

Feel is full bodied but drinkable. Not quite chuggable as it is quite filling, but it's a decent table beer. Medium finish and feels quite malty.

Overall if it was cheaper and less hyped up I'd like it a lot more, but for the impression it makes on non-beer drinkers I'd expect something a bit more crisp, amd refreshing. Everthing is there but I've certainly had a lot better. Closer to a hoppy American lager than a pils, although still better than a lot of euro cheapos."
Popular,Stella Artois,4.55,"If there is no Carlsberg, this is my go to beer. I also have fond memories related to this beer as it was my beer of choice during my college years so it holds a special place in my heart.

Popular,Stella Artois,4.87,"Such a good beer this is my #1 goto.

Taste like a beer should taste, no added fancy flavors or crazy biterness, just a good European beer! Belgium sits between France and Germany, 2 countries who make arguably europes best beers. I can taste both influences, it is hard to describe. I have had atleast a thousand beers but I do not expect to find anything better than Stella. Good beer!"
Popular,Stella Artois,2.09,"This used to be a pretty decent beer 20 years ago, as I recall, but now it is bad. Tastes like soap and burnt caramel with a hint of pee soaked diaper. I have never actually had a pee soaked diaper, but this must be what it tastes like. Very bad, embarrassingly bad. Not something I would ever want again. Really quite awful. Tart, metallic, oily, with a slight hint of barf. AVOID."
Popular,Stella Artois,3.73,"Color is a light gold color, with a fine white foam. Pulls a nice head but dissipates fast. Carbonation is decent. Smells citrusy, light and a hint malty. Flavor is ok.

Popular,Stella Artois,3.53,"From a can dated bb 3-23-23

Nice white sticky head with lace and clean looking pale gold color.

I'll get back to you on the smell, wheat crackers - orange rind hop notes, produce dept..

The malt is not too sweet but picks up a bit of honeyed barley, nice mild drying hops.

Smooth, slick, and refreshing with light carbonation.

I like this beer even compared to many $11 a six craft beers, yet when you get it on sale and get twice as much for the same price, well then it is really hard to beat."
Popular,Stella Artois,3.16,Mi!d aroma with nothing really coming foward. Taste was balanced without any distinguishing character. A bit thin feel with a not much aftertaste. A good middle of the road beer. Too bad we can't drink the recipe from 600 years ago.

Not as bad as canned Stella but I don't like it. Sorry girl I'm going to miss you.

Popular,Furious,3.83,"Poured from a can. Caramel in color with a large tan head and some lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and caramel. Flavors are more towards the pine side with hints of citrus."
Popular,Furious,4.21,"First beer that I've had from Surly as I found this at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona while I was out there recently. Heard a lot about the Abrasive but this easily fit the bill as it was a wonderful IPA with a ton of body and flavor, as it nearly felt like an Amber / Red Ale!

Loved the chestnut hue to this as it was topped off by a *ton* of thick, bready head that stuck around and clung to the side of my pint glass, in the form of deep rings of lacing. A fine haze was in this as there was a ton of caramel, pine, and earthy hops in the nose with them being much stronger in the taste. Some herbal tea spice and bread rounded out the flavor as this was one to fly out of my glass quickly, as the carbonation was just light enough to keep this from feeling too heavy. Orange pith and deep earth emerged as this warmed up, as everything faded nicely once I finished this off.

This had a bit of booze, but nothing excessive, as it complemented the flavor profile quite nicely. Canned on 3/16, this looked and felt as fresh as could be with the impression of a tap beer that I'd easily have again. Loved this brew as it's easy to see why it's ranked so highly on here!"

What a lovely surprise. So much so, going back to baseline e.g., Two Hearted) is boring... I just want to drink another red Surly. It's the hoppy balance with a bit of bite (rye?). I live in Indiana. and wish they offered it in the Hoosier state."
Popular,Furious,4.35,"A tremendous IPA. It pours a deep amber color with strong lacing. Lots of citrus, with some sweetness like caramel or maybe butterscotch. And a truly smooth mouthfeel."
Popular,Furious,4.01,"Canned in October. No doubt the hops have shifted in their representation. Still an impressive hop forward IPA that pays homage to the left coast but establishes its on identity.

Huge head, tons of lace. Lots of pine and citrus What's really lovely is the Scottish malt base.

Nice amount of pine and citrus hits the nose with significant force. Good amount of biscuity malt.

Solid malt front is quickly subsumed by the huge hop component. Pine starts with a big and firm citrus follow through. Super clean and dry finish with a surprising amount of malt. Light hop oil.

Feel is solid and easy drinking. Solid carbonation and quenching swallow.

This reminds me a bit of the early West Coast IPAs like Pizza Port et al. Bigger and heavier malt backbone give it a distinctive personality. Hops are huge and all over this beer. A nice bookend to the other great midwest/heartland American IPA, Bells Two Hearted. Great overall brew. British malt, American hopping. Wonderful beer."
Popular,#9,5,"I personally love this beer, I saw alot of 3.75 rating which was a shock to me. This beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason. I am currently sipping one and I'm 32 years old. I remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when I was just a kid. When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. As weird as that seems, with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times I once had when I was little growing up in the 90s. I miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years."

Popular,#9,3.84,"It's a shame they are no longer at their Burlington, VT spot because I wish I could visit the once popular home to this wonderful serum. Anyways, a bronze liquid fills my glass with a foamy white head. Fairly standard appearance, but a wonderful aroma of apricot/fruity sweetness permeates the glass. A sip and you quite literally are mystified by this beer. What am I drinking? It's got a sweet flavor to it with an almost malty touch. A really crisp clean beer that is unique and hard to describe, but really what it is is delicious."
Popular,#9,5,"This is a solid beer that tastes reminded me of my first taste of home-brewed IPA: more floral fragrant with prevalent apricot notes. One of my favorite all-time recommendations, but maybe not for everyone’s palette if into heavy or bitter brews."
Popular,#9,3.42,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 9/9/290, so 8 months old.

Faintly hazy pale amber body. No head retention, hence no lacing.

Not much of an aroma. Somewhat fruity.

On tasting, the fruit is there, with a fairly strong sour bitterness.

Mouth medium, finish sour bitterness

Overall, none too pleasant to this palate, and I dont think its age related."
Popular,#9,3.6,"Beer pours a little cloudy with a little head, and a few small particulates. Smells more like a fruity ale than an IPA (which I like). tastes pretty good in my opinion, but not as hoppy as a pale ale( perhaps that's why it says not quite pale ale on the front). It's like your average run of the mill ale, but just a bit more fruity and a light hop flavor towards the end. The carbonation is mild, not smooth like nitro brews, but relatively soft. Overall I could drink em all day and not be sick of the taste, but it would be my first choice if I was looking to only drink a beer or two after dinner. That being said if I see them in the custom six pack fridge I would be okay with adding one of these."
Popular,#9,4.06,"A definite rich color and apricot/fruit smell. It claims it's not quite an ale, and it feels like it needs a bit more in the hoppy department to even out the fruit flavor. With all that said, if on a hot day you need something not hoppy and not a lager, this works quite well as an evening drink after a day in the yard."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.3,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides.

Smell is big, bitter, slightly biting - notes of pine, earth, citrus, juniper, some honey and syrupy notes, light caramel.

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, strong bitterness and slight boozy burn.

Overall - amazed that big, big non-hazy IPAs are this hard to find - so much more nuance, flavor, and drinkability."

Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)"
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through. Pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. It reminds me of the original Hoptimum a little. Not a bad strong ale but I’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things, cheers!"
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,"Disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit ABV. Reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong, dark, almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness. A strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can.
I like Stone beers, but this I won't buy again"
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,"Canned April 15th enjoy by August 13th 2022.

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department.

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely.

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with.
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me.

Sticky, somewhat juicy mouthfeel.

Kind of wearing on the palate but I enjoy it."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.31,"So cool they decided to brew this beer again.

Look: Old gold body, nice off-white head.

Smell: Pine, floral notes, orange peel,

Taste: Intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). Some sweet toffee malts mid-palate, fresh squeezed orange juice too. Clean, citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. Wow.

Feel: Very big beer fuller medium to full bodied IPA.

Overall: This beer would be awesome to pair with food. Doesn't make sense to have more than one of these IMO, but this is an awesome West Coast IPA. The kind of IPA that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. And a pretty reasonable price point to boot. If I can find another fresh batch I'm definitely trying this again."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.25,"Pours a clear amber color with a tall head and moderate lacing.

Smells of slightly dank piney hops, sweet fruit and alcohol.

This brew is a bitter burly, almost barleywine, West Coast sipper!"

Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.54,"A big bold bitter ipa. A true tribute to the ruination series. This beer is not for everyone. A very malt forward, West coast ipa. If your palate is training to handle the bitter malt then i highly recommend this one"
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.32,"I dont think i ever had the original.

Look is awesome. Deep amber with great clarity. Whats amazing is rhe syrupy thickness and the way the bubbles slowly rise from the bottom of the glass and just dont stop. I dont think ive ever poured a beer that has this much energy.

Smell is kind of mute.

Taste makes me think I have had this before. Its eerily familiar. Very bitter but not stale or difficult to drink.

Feels ia confusingly dry.

Overall I dont like super high abv IPAs but this one im okay with slow sipping. It might get shitty as it warms though."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.43,"From a 12oz can dated 4/15/22 (canned), 8/13/22 (enjoy by) into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent amber with about three fingers of light tan head. Incredible retention, great lacing. Nice stream of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.

Smells strongly of pine and resin with a nice tropical fruit background (pineapple?).

Very bitter, piney taste. Nice alcohol warmth. Slight malt sweetness.

Very sticky mouthfeel. Strong bitter aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.

Stone does these big bitter beers the best imho without veering off into malty sweetness. This is a gem of a beer if it's what you like."

The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves rings of lacing. The aroma is candied orange, caramel and pine. The taste is bittersweet caramel malt with resinous citrus and pine sap before the earthy fully bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish that's not cloying, but sticky with hop oil. ABV is well hidden. Overall, excellent."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.42,"120z can into a pint glass. Canned 4/20/22, so not even 3 weeks old. The beast is back!!

Looks splendid in the glass. Crystal clear dark amber body with slow streams of carbonation. The off white head maintains throughout, impressive given the abv. Leaves rings and specks of lacing.

Full hoppy, piney aroma.

On tasting, a haymaker to the tastebuds. Full on strong piney resinous bitterness lasts way beyond the finish. Hints of grapefruit. The malt base is strong, allowing a sweetness to lay under the bitterness without being trampled to death. Abv definitely felt, quite warming in the throat.

Mouth close to full, finish a sweetness and then that building, lasting bitterness.

Overall, excellent big dipa, tipa, whatever you want to call it. Had this as a sample at a Knoxville brewfest some years ago, and was hoping it would return. Appreciate the 12oz can size as well."

Powerfully and aggressively hopped throughout, but still kind of balanced by the rich and fairly sweet malty base. Good stuff - when you´re ready for it."
Popular,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.09,"Tremendous nose of pine and citrus that is impossible to ignore. Taste is citrus hops with a slightly sweet malt body and lingering hop presence on the back end. Medium carbonation and medium-high body with some creaminess.
The ABV works with the beer and the way the brewer handled the hop load, ABV, and finish is fantastic. A truly drinkable triple IPA."

Arrived filled to the tip top, zero head, unremarkable smell, tastes common, maybe sub-common.
Feels like a thin food rinse, which worked out fine in pushing a shrimp po’ boy down.
Overall, a solid “meh”."
Popular,Goose IPA,3.53,Straw colored with a moderate head that settles nicely. Aroma is floral with a bit of citrus. Taste is reasonably typical IPA with a good amount of grapefruit with some breadiness and a moderate finish. A solid but not remarkable IPA.
Popular,Goose IPA,3.84,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

S: Grassy, resinous, floral, a little citrus, earthy herbal notes, biscuity bready malt, and a pretty dry finish.

T: Citrus, lemon and grapefruit, floral, resinous pine, subtle fruity notes, apricot and peach, grassy earthy notes, biscuity bready malt, and a dry finish.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: The first few sips feel more like a lightened up classic American IPA with all the pithy citrus presence, but as it warms up the English side really comes out. Nothing overly exciting, but credit where it's due, it's actually pretty nicely balanced and rather drinkable. Probably never gonna be my first choice, but there are worse options to have around."
Popular,Goose IPA,3.44,"L- Good tall light tan head and transparent light copper beer.
S - Bitter grapefruit pith, some resin notes
T- Strongly bitter with grapefruit pith and pine resin notes. Little bit of floral sweetness and light malt do not help tamp down the bitterness for me.
M- Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation and drying bitters.
O- Strong hop bitterness put this out of my favorite zone."
Popular,Goose IPA,3.48,"Poured from a 12oz can
Unsure if this is the right place to review as this is just called IPA not Goose IPA but maybe it's just newer AB branding.

On the pour it's a pretty good looking beer with a decent sized rocky head and some nice lacing. Crystal clear straw color with no haze.

Smell is carrying some grapefruit and tropical notes with a fruity sweetness. I cant pick much else up with this sickness, my nose isnt quite functioning.

The taste is bold with bittering hops right in your face and a nice trickle of fruity flavors following behind it. Maybe a tad bit of malt backing it up, but nothing crazy, just firm pale malts standing in the back.

The feel on the other hand suggests more malts than I'm tasting the head comes back to life as you drink especially in large amounts slowing you down. But it does feel relatively seasonable other than that not too heavy on the stomach.

Overall a standard every day ipa for those that love ipas it isnt shy about the hops and the malts are firm enough to keep it steady. No off flavors and seems good enough quality wise. Not a huge IPA guy myself."
Popular,Goose IPA,3.58,"Pours a clear bright yellow, pillowy white head leave a nicely laced glass. Nose gets some piney hops, some cracker and caramel. Taste is citrus and a bit of sweetness. Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Not bad."

A- pours a clear golden yellow with a one finger head that has shirt retention

S- floral and earthy hops with undertones of biscuit, caramel and honey

T- floral hop bitterness up front is countered by some caramel maltiness. Mid-palate brings out some biscuit and a hint of citrus. The finish falls off, leaving only a hint of floral and citrus hop bitterness

M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish"
Popular,Goose IPA,3.75,"Poured from a bottle, ""Drink by 10 Oct 21"", but I got it from a neighbor who was not storing it cool and not sure how long...
Anyways, it's a classic. I haven't had this in years so won't debate how it holds up against its former 'independent' self, and I don't care. It's a fine IPA, clear amber-yellow and classically bitter and malt-balanced, straight up citrus/pine hops and a dry hoppy finish.

I wouldn't have picked it up in a store, but happy to drink these from a friend."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.86,"Had on tap at the Pour House on Market in Denver in a Sam Adam's ""curvy glass"".

On arrival a one finger fine head that dissipated to a decent covering pretty quickly. Body is a hazy golden yellow with fine but active carbonation. No lacing on this one.

Aroma is intensely lemony with a nice hit of wheat on the back.nowhere near a hefeweizen, but this is an ""American wheat beer"" so it's pretty good. Clean lemony wheat ale.

Taste follows the aroma but it is quite balanced and all the lemon flavor tastes gery natural like lemon juice. Behind that is a solid wheat malty backbone with just a hind of bitterness on the very back. The bitterness could be lemon zest or hops it's hard to tell but maybe they are working together.

The feel has an intense carbonation bite that is quickly followed by a soft and pleasant head. This is a pretty dry beer in terms of mouth feel, but the finish is medium long and quite smooth.

Overall this is a surprisingly nice wheat beer with lemon additions. The grains of paradise aren't particularly noticable but I have a hard time picking up coriander in belgian brews so maybe this is similar. Overall this is a nice summery lemony wheat beer that is nicely balanced in the malt to lemon rind, but hops are hard to specifically pick up."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.81,"Pretty light copper color, a flat wheat taste with barely a hint of citrus. Bland wheat and grass aroma without a distinct citrus scent. Not my favorite from Samuel Adams, but it is a good enough beer."

Taste: Lime zest, lemon zest and wheat. Small amount of hops lingers in there. Tiny pinch of baking spice. Little to no perceivable bitterness.
Feel: Moderate carbonation and light body. Crisp and refreshing.
Overall: This is the beer that got me onto wheat beers and remains as one of my favorite beers. Really refreshing beer for hot days."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.28,"I had high hopes, but the beer is at best lack luster. I'm a home brewer and I recently tried, and liked, Blue Moon Belgian White. I made up a recipe to brew a wheat beer, inspired by Blue Moon Belgian White. So, I thought I would try other brands to see if they were less, equal, or better than the Blue Moon. The Samuel Adams beer is just OK, not close to being equal to the Blue Moon. As I type this, I am drinking a single 12 oz bottle of Shock Top Belgian White (bought to do side by side with Samuel Adams Summer Ale) and it could be a kissin' cousin to Samuel Adams Summer Ale. I do not think I could tell them apart in a blind test. I will not be buying either of these again, and will go with the light, tasty, and very refreshing Blue Moon Belgian White. Both of these beers command a premium as compared to Bud, Coors, Tecate, etc, but they don't deliver on the taste, so, why bother and pay more? They all are, after all, just beer, and are very drinkable. My first impression, when I drank the Samuel Adams Summer Ale was, ""I'm glad I only bought the six pack of bottles and not paid twice as much for the 12 pack!"""
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,4,"Poured from tap into 16 oz pint glass at Red Robin in Saratoga Springs, NY. Pours golden yellow with two inch foam. Floral and citrus notes on the nose with slight albeit refreshing citrus tastes coupled with light hops. Good and refreshing."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.59,"Slight lemon zest smell mixed with some light malt. You can taste the typical wheat beer flavor on the front but then there is this strange lemony, sour, citrus finish. I make it sound bad- it’s not bad. It’s actually very refreshing on a hot day like it was today. The grains of paradise make a decent showing in this beer and add a nice depth to it overall. I will probably be buying some more before the season ends. At 5.3% ABV, it’s easy to enjoy a few of these while grilling or sitting outside with friends. It’s not my usual choice of beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. Try a 6-pack if you haven’t already."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.26,"This is an interesting citrus wheat beer. It's got more fruit flavor than something like a Blue Moon, but there's something odd about the smell. I think I just don't like beers that smell too fruity. Taste is better than the smell, but I'd like at least a little bit of bitterness and hop flavor. I also taste something slightly spicy, but I'm not sure what it is. Overall, just an average beer."
Popular,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.06,"Even with low expectations this still disappoints. Does not resemble any other wheat beer I've had, and other large-ditro one's get it done much better. Sam's just consistently brews below-avg beer."

Overall... I am always reticent to try new beers from the Boston Beer Company as I have not bought one in 20 years? Yikes it probably has been that long!!! And this beer was given to by a friend so i will maybe have to take off the 20 year hiatus off the Sam Adams, Anyway this beer is very nice example of heff pilsener mix."

Popular,White,4,"Long review short:
What seperates this wheat beer from all others in the pack is the quality of the ingredients. It feels and tastes like someone cares."
Popular,White,4.28,"Bottle from Whole Foods.

A mildly hazy light yellow with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is rich and delicate with a blend of soft grain, light spice with soft clove and a really lovely, delicate citrus note. Delicate yeast notes and soft earth.

Crisply carbonated, lovely texture. Brilliant."
Popular,White,2.19,"I am not a fan of white beers or wit biers in general so this is a biased review from start. Had it on tap at high-end steakhouse. Good, solid pour with appreciable head. Unfortunately, tasted like other white beers and added nothing new. My opinion on these have not changed"
Popular,White,3.84,"Procured in a trade with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in July 2022.

Pours a very pale, almost watery yellow. It has a thin foam rim around the edges and leaves lacing on the glass.

The nose is yeasty, vinous and spicy, with coriander peeking out between the layers. It's what I consider a classic witbier smells like.

Taste closely follows aroma. There's more clove on the palate than picked up in the nose, and the spices really pop once the beer is on the tongue. The finish is quite dry, which immediately makes me want a second sip.

In the mouth, there's a significant carbonic prickle, and it follows the beer down with the swallow. The beer is not particularly high in alcohol but it leaves a warmth in the stomach.

Overall, this is a very tasty beer and could be drunk in significant quantities if desired, especially on a hot day.

Cheers!"

There is some citrus, but this is definitely a resin type of DIPA. Dry finish with plenty of bitterness. There's some malt character here but it is easily overshadowed by the hops. It feels a bit on the heavier end of IPAs and does tend to stick around. As I continue to sip on it, notes of pineapple, savory notes, and even candied dried fruit."

Popular,Maximus,4.13,I got a 6pck of bottles of this beer from my local meijer store. It poured a clear copper with thin white head that is leaving some lace.

Popular,Maximus,3.72,"12oz Lagunitas bottle served in a pint glass. Beer is brilliant golden in color, with great clarity, and a nice fat orange-tinged head. Aroma doesn't have me jumping up and down, but there's big alpha hop flavor, complemented with a very slightly syrupy golden caramelized malt body. An oldschool IIPA that doesn't go overboard on alpha. The result is bitter but still quite drinkable. Super Cluster is obviously way more modern and interesting, but balance never goes out of style."

Medium light body, moderate minus carbonation; no warmth from 9% abv; no astringency; smooth malty/sticky feel.

Pours a lovely amber, I didn't get much of a head but the lacing is there. Smells wonderful, like grapefruit, lemon, malt and a nice vegetal essence. The taste is definitely balanced, in an impressive way with sweet malt as a backbone and sharp citrus notes with bitter hops all dancing in harmony. Slightly quick and clean finish. Each sip makes me want more, but at 9.0% abv this one is dangerous."

Smooth and very tasty, the grapefruit flavor hits you first, followed by a semi sweet pine and spicy/herbal mix, very earthy. It leaves a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth.
The body feels a bit light for the style, but that being said, the flavor is right on and more than makes up for the feel, overall this is a fun beer to drink."

Popular,Maharaja,4.89,This is an amazing beer. I have no idea why the named it after the official beer from India. The Indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. This is a man's beer. Fruity mango. Nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. Love it. Get it if you can
Popular,Maharaja,3.66,"Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. I could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like I've over done it, which is rare with me and DIPAs.

Popular,Maharaja,4.29,"The color is a beautiful dark gold that lightens slightly at the top of the glass. Head is nicely developed and remains on edges of glass well after pour. I was surprised by the smell— sweet for an imperial, with mango and pineapple immediately, along with a twinge of dank hops. The taste is big and complex. Sweet at first, with the mango and pineapple, becoming floral pine and bready malt, finishing moderately dank and bitter. The 10% is apparent after a few sips. Feel is wonderfully creamy, soft, and wet, which seems to balance the big flavor and ABV.
I can’t say huge IPAs are my favorite, but this beer does everything so well I can’t help but appreciate it. I’d love to have it fresh on tap sometime."
Popular,Maharaja,3.26,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. OG 1090, ABV 10.41%. 102 IBU. Orange colour, big off-white head with an orangey hue. Strong sweetish aroma with notes of tropical fruits, citrus and pine, very nice. The flavour is sweet, alcoholic and dominated by an absurd amount of American hops from start to finish. Unbalanced. Another example of ""overkill""."
Popular,Maharaja,4.16,"Im giving this 4 cuz I love Avery but I need to have this again for sure. It was good but I tasted the alcohol a lot. This has such a high reputation though so if you're feeling it you should see for yourself.


UPDATE!!! Much better the second time around, im not really tasting the alcohol like before. Much better experience"
Popular,Maharaja,3.82,"~80 Days old when opened (canned on 12/16/2020)

A: Deep copper orange with significant haze without being murky
S: Nice aroma of dank green pine with wafts of citrus. Noticeable strong malt tying it all together
T: intense dank resin that brightens towards citrus zest. Strong bitter carried by sappy honey
Mf: hefty but deceiving given the abv
Overall: pretty intense but focuses a complex hop profile nicely. this particular can is not very fresh, so I can imagine a much better hop experience closer to the canning date"

Feel nice carbonation and served around 40 degrees .
Overall this beer is excellent and has nice Heft! Not watered down. I will be serving this to my friends, neighbors and relatives over the holidays or as gifts !"
Popular,Maharaja,3.52,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a nice foamy light tan head of 1F sits on a golden orange tinged beer with about 80% transparency.

The nose is floral, bready, light grapefruit and pine.

I taste lightly sweet malt with grapefruit and alcohol with pithy hop dryness. I also get some pine and a bit of sulfur and a hint of thymol (Listerine note). This is not nearly as dark and dank as Avery describes. It is not too bitter but rather presents too much of a sharp alcohol character.

Mouthfeel is slick and medium bodied with drying astringency and alcohol. Very light carbonation and a hint of metallic tang.

I am glad I got to try this beer. The beer did not taste super hoppy unless it is those ""off"" notes of thymol and pine resin mixed with alcohol that is just not doing it for me. It is certainly drinkable and interesting but I don't think I would buy it again as I prefer Odell Myrcenary quite a bit more."

Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.25,"I have had this beer many times and much enjoy it. I can’t believe I never actually reviewed it. So here it goes
Poured from a can into tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazed deep amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has amazing retention, slowly fading over time and leaving a ton of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a biscuit malt mixed with lots of coriander and some clove. Along with these aromas comes notes of yeast and apricot as well as a touch of pepper and hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with a nice blend of spice of coriander, clove, and white pepper. Other flavors of yeast and herb are there as well, blending nicely with the malt and spice. There is a bit of sweetness mixed within as well, with notes of apricot, peach, and white grape. The taste remains similar in nature throughout, maintaining a smooth and balanced flavor. A touch of hay joins in at the end, leaving one with a flavorful, but nice crisp and clean taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel- The body is very light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. Fantastic for the style and taste and very easy drinking.
Overall – A great Belgian pale ale. Super flavorful and amazingly easy to drink. Fantastic."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.2,"L - Poured as directed by Orval leaving one centimeter in the bottle. Beautiful caramel-orange color with a three finger creamy head and aggressive carbonation. Head retention is the most I have seen on a beer. High lacing throughout the session.

S - I was surprised at the faintness of the nose. Some spice, citrus pith and malt. But, towards the end of the session, the spice and malt stepped up with a hint of bread. I then realized the beer was too cold.

T - Citrus peel, malt and hop bitterness, which is more pronounced than expected and nicely lingers on the finish. The hop bitterness is interesting because it is so balanced. Unlike other Belgian styles, this ale is only slightly sweet.

F - Medium-full bodied with high carbonation that becomes more tame. Medium dry finish. ABV is not overwhelming but you begin to feel it towards the end of your glass.

O - This is a strange beer for me. My first Belgian anything that was not sweet. Oh, and the bitterness through me for a loop. However, the bitterness was very nice and as the beer warmed, the aroma and flavor increased in layers. Definitely will have this again."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,"I’m reminded of valet Chris Rock agape at Eddie Murphy’s dump truck in BHC2: I get $20 for a car, $50 for a limo, WTF is that???

Like nothing I’ve had before. Wild yeast, dry hopped, Belgian fruit notes, slight sweetness, light malt. Tastes like someone mixed a Belgian ale with a British pale ale. Awesome white head and golden body. Pungent spicy aroma. Unique and high quality."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.17,"Bottle at Sabatinis in Exeter pa earlier this evening. 2020 release. Orval Day 2022.

Looks splendid in the chunky Orval goblet. Hazy orange yellow body. Generous white head persists throughout leaving layers of lacing.

Some fruit notes on the nose, and the abv is apparent.

On tasting, strong and full flavored. Quite bitter, some light fruit wafts in and out. Abv seems higher than the 6.9 listed. A little sweetness here and there.

Mouth very full. Finish bitter and a little drying.

Overall, enjoyable drink once the palate adjusts to the bitterness level and can enjoy the nuances. Wouldn't say no to another."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,3.86,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head that lingers like root beer float. (4.50)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of citrus upfront. Followed by grapefruit, juicyfruit, bubblegum, and bread spice esters. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong and funky flavors here. There's grapefruit and tart pear fruit. Then a strong funky yeast in the middle. A semi-sweet pale malt finish. The funk lingers. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A full mouthfeel with a lingering funk. (3.75)

Compared to Saison Dupont 5/21/22: Pours a darker color, larger head. Stronger aromas. More funky yeast. Less juicyfruit and bread spice. A larger body, and sweeter.

Overall: A lot more barnyard funk on this one that I had expected. Almost overpowering. Granted, this one is about 3-5 years in age. Maybe more than usual wild yeast formed. Hard to get a whole lot of other flavors here because the funk and tart fruit overpower a bit. Not sure if this is normal for this one. I think this one may have been spoiled. Maybe I'll have to try it fresh sometime. (Rating: 3.86)"
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,3.32,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. (Bottled on 08/07/2021, poured on 05/10/2022.) Humongous off-white/bone white head on a not very aggressive pour. Head does not dissipate quickly. It’s frothy and foamy to no end. Lacing stays for the whole drink. It’s a light copper clear color. Incredibly appealing look.

S - Deep malt characteristics up front. Warm baked bread. A little yeast sweetness as well.

T - Taste is lighter than scent. More of a cracker or biscuit malt, with some sourness paired with sweetness. Light fruits come through as well. Maybe a citrus zest. Some earthy tones appear in there. Finish has some mild bitterness and pepperiness. The hoppy bitterness and pepper is more present as it warms up. These dry bitter flavors really overpower the second half of the drink.

F - Medium-to-heavy carbonation, but medium-to-light mouthfeel. Surprisingly dry finish. Almost like a brut champaign. The more I drink it, there’s a lot of dry aftertaste. Which is not appealing.

O - Overall, I love the complexity and mixture of this beer at the start. It begins as a great blend of malts, yeast, and light hops, with none of them overpowering the other. Each taste brings something a little different. Then, as you drink, the bitterness, dryness, and pepper starts to overpower. So much so, that my appreciation diminished by the end. I didn’t even want to take the last two gulps to finish it. Unfortunately, I will not add it to my rotation, and would not recommend in favor of other offerings."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.34,"Bottled Dec 21, 2021. Pours a hazy penny-copper colour with two fingers of thick, white head. It slowly collapses, sticking around a decent amount, into a millimetre (or two) thick dense foam cap.

Spicy and doughy aromas typical of Belgian yeast swirl with a little bit of floral, spicy hop notes. Caramel malt is present in good amount. Slight funky earthy spin, with good leanings towards some lightly musty but fruity affect — grape, apple, and citrus.

Feels like I’ve been waiting my whole life to try a beer like this, fusing my love of crisp pale ales and doughy Belgian ales. Spicy and fruity up front, biscuity and doughy on the back end, medium-low presence of bittering hops throughout that are primarily earthy and floral in quality. The spicy, peppery phenolic character is quite nice, and a little nutty as well, a mix between almond slices and cloves, white peppercorn and coriander. Citrus zest and peel is noticeable on the back half of each sip, and adds both a fresh quality and adds to the bittering presence of the hops. A beer that lets each note rise before melding into the next one before melding into the next one, which gives this beer a remarkably balanced taste profile. Grassy, zesty, earthy, mildly funky. The funk is stronger on the nose than palate.

Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation, fairly effervescent. Long, doughy and yeasty finish that leaves impressions of bitter hop and lemon peel on the edges of your tongue and hints of phenolic spice. Finishes dry.

A Belgian Pale Ale… Finally! I love PAs, and I absolutely adore Trappist ales. Combining the two, amazing! When the LCBO finally got a new batch in I could have it for the first time! This is a very fresh batch that I need to grab about 5 so I can cellar them and come back to this review every couple of months. Great fusion of flavours. I can see this mellowing and evolving over the years, though I imagine there’s likely a Goldilocks zone before it gets too aged it mellows out the great yeasty phenols as well as the grassy, fresh hops that are present in higher amounts than almost any other Trappist ale and most Belgians in particular. Lovely ale"
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.21,"I've read the previous review by illtexzona , and agree that freshness has to do a bunch with quality. the Whole Foods in my neighborhood started carrying Belgian & Trappist things & most recently Orval. I bought 2 almost immediately- probably the freshest Orval Ive had, & it's a completely different animal than the ones at the other most reputable liquor store- totally worth the (recently inflated) price."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,3.75,"Bottled April 8/21.
Pours a clear orange amber colour with teaming fluffy off white head. a bit of haze as got some dregs at last of pour.
Fruity funky aroma - earthy hops, definite Brett effect - grape, lime, ripe apple - fruity esters, bubblegum and a touch of band aid.
Taste follows with a funky fruity sweetness, that somehow manages to be tart and a bit spicy; notes of lemon, bubblegum, and at the back an aggressive bitterness that mixes with an herbal sweet-tart flavour.
Exceptionally effervescent carbonation, boldly bittersweet and funky with a dry finish. Have had before and frankly enjoyed more - I feel I did not hit the sweet spot of age for me."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.27,"I'd call it a deep honey color liquid with marshmallow fluff filling the glass. It is a little hazy but you can still see thru it. The head stubbornly falls to a dollop, but is leaving huge residue on the glass.

The aroma is fruity banana esters, slightly sweet, a bit of bubble gum. White grape, some extremely mild funk, some earthy brett. A bready note supports all of the aromatics. Maybe a little lemony citrus to cut through the rest and liven it up some.

The taste is intriguing. Not at all what I expected from the nose. It is really soft. I get the esters and bubblegum notes first with a lovely malty sweetness, but with further sips the aromatic notes recede a bit and it lays even more more malty and spicy. It strikes me more like a wild ale, quite yeasty but with more than enough malt to tie everything together. If it is funky at all, it is very laid back. There is spiciness that seems like a bit of coriander and a hint of anise. It's fairly phenolic giving it a nice peppery sensation. Noticeable amount of bitterness on the finish, and there is a lemon note that lingers and helps reset the taste buds.

I'd call the body medium, lively carbonation, pretty dry. The bitterness, while evident, is pleasantly mellow.

It's unique - and somehow everything that is going on plays nicely in the sandbox to deliver a highly enjoyable drinking experience that I really can't put into words. This is certainly a case where the gestalt matters. It's fun, makes me happy."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,5,"Orval it’s a classic and Unique Trappist beer. With golden brown color, high carbonation, and amazing head retention! Aroma Wiest sweetness and Wood and a flavor of Slight malt yeast and have a woody bitterness that comes through. Cheers!"
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,3.83,"Served from the bottle in a Boulevard tall tulip.

Pours a partly hazy sunrise auburn topped by over a finger of bone foam. The nose comprises sharp hay, dry biscuit, grass, sweet flowers, and funky wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish. An enjoyable Trappist treat that gets even more interesting with more age on it (4 and 5 years seem to be damn solid right now)."

Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.28,"Bottle bought in 2016, finally opened 1/3/2022.

A - Pours copper orange, mostly transparent but some haze with the yeast, short white head, persistent cap, some lacing but not much.

S - Brett up front, bandaids and acidity, apple and white wine, grape highlights. As it warms, the Brett recedes and a powerful bubble gum sweetness comes forward.

T - Follows the nose, but with the acidity, fruit and a touch of bitter pith front, and the Brett coming in beneath. The plastic and barnyard notes are there but they work as a part of the whole.

M - Bright brisk carbonation, light weight, slick feel, clean finish.

O - A rock solid drinking experience, 5+ years in the making. Quite happy I opened this one up."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.18,"Bottle dated 8/7/21, drank 1/1/22

This is the probably the freshest Orval I've ever drank. I'd compare it to drinking a young lambic, and how it mellows out and flavors change over time. Young Orval pours with a ton white foam in the middle and whispy head around the edges. Tons effervescent carbonation and grassy hops. The belgian yeast hasn't had a lot of time to take over yet. I've had this beer several times and now I want to do some side by sides with aging after having this fresh one."
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.8,This is probably the best beer on the planet. No two Orvals taste the same; every bottle offers a unique experience. You can drink it fresh or aged. I am currently imbibing an Orval bottled in April of 2020 and it is out of this world. These Brewers from Brasserie d'Orval only need this single offering and its humble labeling to show what true Masters they are.
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.03,This was stupid carbonated to me but I was forced to drink it out of the bottle at the time. That said it heavily reminded me of champagne and I look forward to putting this in a glass next time
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.15,"Pour is highly effervescent with a lot of white foam. Smells like raisin and is very smooth heft on the palate. Tastes phenolic with slight brown sour dough bread with slight hops. The 6.9 ABV is hidden well. Overall, complex & smooth; I like it!"
Popular,Orval Trappist Ale,4.56,"Appearance: Cloudy, muddy copper. Pours to a massive frothy off white head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Lots of funky, yeasty aromas.

Flavor: Moderate bitterness. Spicy & earthy.

Mouth-Feel: Light to medium bodied, a little creamy. Pours highly effervescent, but releases the carbonation nicely. Drying, moderate length finish with a mild trailing bitterness.

Overall: This would be consider a ""young"" beer. Bottled in May 2021, drank in November. It still has the yeasty, hoppy character that mellows with age. Curious how this will taste about a year or two down the road. Pours super carbonated, producing a huge, fluffy off-white head, but seems to release the carbonation better than other Belgians. Makes it a little more drinkable. Very nice."
Popular,Yeti,3.15,"The 9.5% ABV was too high. Don't get me wrong, I love a great buzz as much as the next guy. But my taste buds mostly registered the alcohol flavor which overwhelmed the other flavors in the beer."
Popular,Yeti,4.73,"Here’s another one I’m surprised I haven’t reviewed before.

Pours a luscious liquid black, like delicious motor oil. Creamy cocoa cap of foam.
Cocoa and coffee roasty notes come up front on the nose. The sip has a prominent hoppiness that gives it a sharp roast character. Long lingering finish. Opens as it warms. Always reliable. Always delicious."
Popular,Yeti,4.24,"Looks dark black, jet black, frothy head that lingers, some very nice lacing. It's a little cool still so there's a bit of haze on the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, toasted malt, licorice, syrup/molasses, maybe some BBQ bark.

Taste follows. Very chewy, thick beer. Not overly sweet, finishes dry and bitter. Actually reminiscent of Storm King. Maybe it's cascade? Anyway, nice easy drinking, bitter option. Good beer. Easily worth the price of admission."
Popular,Yeti,4.94,"Poured into a pint glass at about 50 degrees. Black as used motor oil with a khaki 2.5 finger head that reduces down to a nice thick film that lasts. Epic lacing from the top down. Absolutely no light coming through this beer. Smell is heavily roasted coffee and baker's cocoa, with a very slight hoppy funk hidden underneath the malt character. Taste blows me away with rich cocoa and straight coffee with very little sweetness aside from an initial and very short-lived toffee kick, and the hops really add a nice floral punch that ends in a long-lasting bitter hanging on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and fairly heavy, but velvety smooth and the CO2 level is somewhat light, which makes it filling, but not bloating. Alcohol is hidden nicely under all the bitter malt and hop character making this a very nice sipper that really hits the imperial stout bullseye."
Popular,Yeti,4.25,"Look: Jet black pour from a 12oz can into a 20 oz cup. A bit of foam risen to the surface. Not much lacing as it goes down.
Smell: The aroma resembles a heavy caramel toasty stout with slight chocolate after hints.
Taste: Heavy roasted chocolate for the initial sip followed by aromas of caramel aftertaste.
Feel: medium to heavy bodied for this one, doesn’t taste like a 9%. It resembles a 6-7% for me. Not to shabby.
Overall: Not bad! I’ve been meaning to try this beer for a while but haven’t had the chance to get it. It’s a once in a lifetime experience so if you can get you’re hand on it I say go for it to at least try. This wasn’t the pick of the crop for me but it doesn’t mean it isn’t for anyone else."
Popular,Yeti,4.13,"Very nice lacey head. Smell is sweet— caramel malt, coffee, and a hint of citrus. Taste follows- a pronounced pine hoppiness upfront becomes leather, roasted malt, caramel, and salt, finishing with coffee and chocolate notes. Moderate to high carbonation, and quite masked alcohol. A very nicely balanced, not overly sweet stout. Can’t ask for more than that."
Popular,Yeti,4.31,"Stunning pour. Huge thick lacey brown rich head, that just stayed there.

Slight hoppiness on the nose, and in the taste. Not really enough maltiness to break through, but still very enjoyable overall.

Seems almost impossible to get FRESH Toppling Goliath here unfortunately.

Pours into my tulip a peach gold shade with a big fluffy creamy ecru head. Lots of particulates in the beer. Head is long lived and leaves fluffy sheets of lace.

Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.

Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.

Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.

This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,5,"This is pure, unfiltered, and unimaginably delicious beer. 16oz can poured into a snifter at 50F. Opaque hop slurry looking like a glass of orange juice. Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue. Overall one of the best beers I have ever had."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.35,"Pours a thick hazy deep amber with an overflowing foamy head.
Bursting with mango, orange scent, grass with fresh rain.

Medium bodied, quite carbonated., finishes clean."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.45,"This second-most popular staple from my hometown brewery is initially something I thought was nothing special, but when I matured, I determined that it has pizazz; not overpowering, but just right. Not the absolute most special, but so extremely satisfying and well-crafted."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.49. PKG on 1/31/2022 with a best buy date of 5/31/2022, so this is just over 3 1/2 months old.

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.

Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.

Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.

Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.11,"One of the better Pale Ales out there. Has a very nice hazy appearance with light fruity tropical smell. I like the taste of the citra hops, juicy and mango citrusy flavor. It's a little light on the overall flavor punch to me because it's a pale ale at 5.8% but I can see why it's rated so high. Quality brew by Toppling Goliath."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.57,"Very hazy apricot color with moderate white head that retains well and produces some nice lacing. The aroma is citrus, pine resin with possible mango, pineapple and passionfruit notes, very juicy.
The taste is pine resin and grapefruit up front, mellowing into mildly sweet light malt with lots of tropical fruit notes - orange, pineapple, mango, passionfruit. The finish is lingering passionfruit with a return of the pine, very interesting and tasty from start to finish.

Altogether this is one tasty and enjoyable brew that I would place somewhere between a NEIPA and a pale ale but it is outstanding, whatever. I already want more."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.16,"Simply put, this is a very nice IPA. It’s single-hop Citra, which is unusual in todays world. It’s hazy, but not extreme. It’s fruity, but not overly fat and sweet. Balance is the right word. I normally don’t line hazy IPAs very much, but this one I actually line a lot. A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too."

It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind.

Poured from a can dated one month ago."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.7,"Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.

Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.25,"Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA."
Popular,Pseudo Sue,4.79,"Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip.

Smells of citrusy hops and a touch of tropical fruits.

Tastes great! Very refreshing.

Mouthfeel is solid. Light carbonation with a nice viscosity.

Overall a solid brew. Haven’t been able to get this in our area until a few years ago and took a long break from reviews. Picked up a 4 pack to try. Worth the wait."
Popular,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.83,"330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 5/26/23, so plenty fresh.

Looks nice in the glass. A glassy pale yellow body with a small white head, shrinking to a ring and covering.

Strong banana, wheat, yeasty aroma.

On tasting, confirms the nose. It's very strong, maybe a little too strong.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish wheat, yeast, and a faint bitter note.

Overall, pretty decent witbier, maybe a bit too strong to be considered refreshing, but a nice enough drink."
Popular,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.84,"As summer comes to an unofficial close this weekend, this is a good time to remember a nice summer time brew. We picked up a pack of Hoegaarden a few weeks ago and enjoyed them in rapid succession on a nice rooftop night. This beer is Allagash and Blue Moon with some balls. Great spice to these suds with lovely orange notes and a real spice kick. Both RC and myself had never had it before and I'm sure it will be revisited soon."
Popular,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.73,"One of my top beers. It is amazing that something bursting with so much flavor is so inexpensive relatively.

Strong wheat flavors, mixed with something herbal or botanical. Very easy to drink quickly - once I start drinking a bottle it is so delicious and smooth that it does not last long. Cloudy appearance with bits of yeast swirling around."
Popular,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.74,"11.2oz bottle freshest before 28/02/2023 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 4.9% ABV. The beer pours hazy soft yellow in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap. The aroma is mild with coriander, wheat malt and vague citrus peel. The taste is all of that with a nice injection of clove / bubblegum yeast flavor. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish.

Popular,Coors Light,2.76,"Obviously, it's Coors light. There is a mix of light bread and banana scents with a much cleaner finish than the competitor light beers.

Popular,Coors Light,2.23,"Had an original Coors beer recently and it brought back memories from the 60s for me. Got one of these to see if it did the same. It did. Not close to what I really remember though. Anyway, if you're looking for something light, this one will work."
Popular,Coors Light,1.9,"Poured from a 12oz can best by September 12th 2022 into a pils glass

On the pour I was pleasantly surprised by a nearly 4 finger head from a slightly hard pour. The dissipation is still fast enough that it goes down to a covering over top in a minute, but still I expected worse. Very very lively carbonation with a very pale straw body, barely darker than a champagne.

Aroma is bad. Watered down, and what is there is all awful terribly treated yeast. Has an old sweaty character to it with a certain metallic quality as well. No malts are detectable on the nose over all the offness. Straight failure barely has a beer smell it's just bad. Not disgusting like shit, but it's bad. I can see why it's called piss water.

Taste is thankfully not like the smell some malts are actually present, just a vague crackery malt with zero bitterness to balance. The malts come at the very end however and the rest of the beer gives a beer flavored seltzer vibe. Very watery even in flavor.

Feel is of carbonated water with much more carbonation bite than necessary. Slightly more body than actual soda water with some head forming on your sip but it's hard to get past the carbonation bite. Super easy to put down from the can though, for the same reason white claws are easy to put down, your body assumes it's just bubbles and water.

Overall you'd probably be better off drinking keystone light or even bud light. I prefer Banquet over Budweiser, but coors light is some authentic piss water."
Popular,Coors Light,2.78,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge, spongy head atop.

Aromas are defined by fresh cut hay, a spicy hop note and a rustic toffee sweetness.

This has quite a refreshing mouthfeel to it with a late, stony effervescence, highlighting the light body of the beer.

Tastes of hay, well water and a bubbly, mineralic carbonation, inviting a well working malt backbone to the palate. Has a subtle, yet sugary mid palate with nothing else to offer and finishes with a sprizzy, yet watery ending.

This manages to be light and refreshing, while unfolding a one dimensional flavor profile at the same time, making this perfect for when its effect is more important than the beer‘s actual taste."
Popular,Coors Light,2.72,"There are some instances when Coors Light tastes like the greatest thing in the world. When you need a light beer and you peer over at the tap handles and spot Bud. Then Miller. And then you scan a little further and see those mountains peering over the other handles it brings a feeling of relief over me. Of the big three light beers in the US, this is without any dispute, the best. Semi sweet, crisp, American piss water. How it should. I’m a sucker for a good Molson Canadian, this basically that in light form. We get it, light beer, piss, feh. There’s a time and a place for Coors light. It’s refreshing, it goes down like nothing and it doesn’t tastes like stale cat urine. That’s a win in my book. Love Train."

Popular,Coors Light,1.84,"So, I'm frequently prompted to drink this in a nearby neighbors' garage upon passing. I am frequently reminded that this is the very worst of all the macros, at least the popular ones. Surely there is worse beer possible, so I left room for those with my rating."
Popular,Coors Light,3.5,"It’s not a classy, sophisticated, craft beer. I know it. The color doesn’t give you warm fuzzies about it having taste. It smells like any macro in its class, nothing special. All that being said, I enjoy an ice-cold Coor’s Light. It’s light on the palate, refreshing, and not overbearing. You don’t drink it to impress or prove your knowledge of beer. You drink it because you’re a beer guy and it goes well with burgers or wings. It’s also nice to have while watching football or a movie.

It’s not going to overwhelm you with anything but you know what you’re getting. It’s wholesome, it’s decent, it’s affordable."
Popular,Coors Light,3,"I grabbed a can of Coors Light from somebody's refrigerator in California. I drank the can of Coors Light and wrote a review...

Smell: Coors Light had a chemical grainy adjunct beer aroma.
Taste: Coors Light had a vague flavour similar to carbonated water with hints of alcohol.

Red skewed amber with a crackly, generous papyrus colored head and even some nice lace.

Juicy grape, mango, and peach rings. Vibrant, and again, very juicy.

The peach rings and gummy candy come out strong. There’s a malt backbone with an English character, which is something I haven’t tasted in a hot minute. The bitterness is smooth, medium, and finishes cleanly.

A medium-light body and creamy carbonation combine for a really put together beer.

I thought I’d had this before and that it wasn’t memorable, but now I’m not so sure. This is a really nice combination of new hops and throwback to English pale ales and early American craft."
Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.63,"L - Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a medium brown color. Two finger off white/light tan head on medium-aggressive pour. Head appears frothy. Lacing is frothy and dissipates back to head quickly. Reduces down to a film. Can bring back a small head with agitation.

S - Bready malts up front. Some sweetness as well. A little bubble gum or even honey. A little spice too.

T - Taste is a wonderful caramel molasses, with bready malt. Some dark fruits and spice come in also. Bubble gum and cola hits as well. No hoppy bitterness at all. A little bitter chocolate though.

F - Excellent medium mouthfeel and solid carbonation.

O - Overall, this beer is a treat. I love malt-forward beers, and this one does not disappoint. The whole Trappistes Rochefort range is one of my favorites. This is already in my regular rotation, and I highly recommend it to all."

Look:
Cloudy and opaque chestnut brown with a 1-finger creamy tan head. The head dissipates to a 0.25"" cover that only starts to break up when I start sipping the beer. Excellent lacing down along the glass

Smell:
Sweet fruits along with dark fruits such as dates, raisins, currants, and plums. Touches of brown sugar. Hints of baking spices such as nutmeg and Ceylon cinnamon. Very slight booziness. There is a faint underlying malt note also.

Taste:
Closely follows the nose with the fruits leading the parade but are then joined by more pronounces spices and bready malts. A sip finishes sweet with a very slight alcohol burn.

Feel:
Smooth and velvety with a medium-full body.

Overall:
An outstanding BSDA and an outstanding beer. This bottle is more than a tad old - it is over a year and a half past it's best-before date and was purchased over 6.5 years ago (Nov, 2015). And it is still very, very good."
Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.56,"A careful pour yields a finger and a half of a large frothy white head, which dissipates leaving a white bubbly ring around the glass. A deep, chestnut brown colour that is very cloudy.

It’s got a nose as delicious as any strong Belgian dark, so you know what you’re getting. The stars for Rochefurt 8? Deep aromas of raisins and dried dark fruits, sugared and caramelized desserts and fruits, very rich and gorgeous smelling yeasty, doughy breads. A lot of spices mixing in here, I’ve never been an expert on spices but you can always recognize cloves, though I wouldn’t say that’s the major spice smell here. Cardamom? Blackcurrant?

Lovely and complex taste, which (as contrived as this always sounds) follows the nose pretty tightly. Those doughy, chewy malts are just too enjoyable. Definitely nice and sweet, the high alcohol level brings tastes of rum, raisins, and figs, as they always do for malty Belgian dark ales. Spicy cloves and peppery notes dance around, the candi sugar on the palate also gives me a gentle cinnamon impression, though it intermingles well with all the spices. Long, tasty doughy finish, very malty and bready. Nutty toffee, caramelized desserts. What else can you say? It’s phenomenal as always.

Now, while the flavours are strong for beers in general, I’m going to say they are wonderfully balanced for Belgian dark ales. Strong dark malty beers like Aventinus Eisbock is more of an explosion of these flavours, and certain other Belgian darks are more unrestrained. This works in this beers favour, for anyone who enjoys the style will enjoy the complex evolution of the flavours over time.

Medium bodied and fairly sweet, this is slightly more carbonated than others in this style, medium carbonation overall. The good carbonation coupled with the small bubbles creates a foamy and creamy sip. Semi-dry finish with well concealed alcohol that emerges just enough to breathe life into the flavours on the palate, giving them a unique dimension.

Hell of a beer. Absolutely delicious, while some lament the size of their cellar list, I am always happy I have so many Rochefurt beers in mine!"

Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.06,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber to mahogany coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of slightly bready, caramel malt and candied fruit, with hints of brown sugar, spice and honey as well. Taste is a great balance of slightly bready, caramel malt and strong candied fruits, with notes of fig, date and plum, as well as lighter apple and apricot, distinct brown sugar and honey, with some spicy accents of clove and cardamon as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a strong sweetness and some candied fruit, brown sugar and hints of spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light carbonation.

While this certainly makes for a very rich and complex example of the style, it's just too sweet for my personal taste, which is somewhat mitigated by a light bitterness in the finish, while I can also appreciate those spicy accents, but those overwhelming caramel malt, brown sugar and honey notes are bit much for me, bordering on cloying, while the fruity notes feel quite candied as well, resembling those candied fruit bits you get in fruitcakes. This certainly has a certain feel of fruitcake drenched in honey to it overall and while some may love that, it's really not for me. I much prefer the darker and a bit more roasty and bitter Rochefort 10, which is a lot better balanced to my personal taste."

Popular,Trappistes Rochefort 8,5,"Purchased at the LCBO on 11/11/21. Stored at 4 C, on it's side, and poured into a chalice.

Appearance - Pours a maduro brown, it's the spitting image of the wrapper of the cigar I'll be smoking after dinner, a CAO Flathead Carb 660, with a medium thickness white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film, a little thicker in the center.

Smell - Strong fruits with a nice nutty, malty undertone tying it all together. I'm picking up raisins, currants and it reminds me of fruitcake. In the best way possible, I like a rich, well made fruitcake.

Taste - Just a slight hint of alcohol burn at first taste, which is quickly killed by the maltyness. The above noted fruit flavours then rush in and it's a long finish more malt and baking spices.

Feel - I love the creamyness of this beer, it's full bodied with carbonation on the milder side of medium. Nicely coats the mouth, enhancing the finish.

Overall - This is one of my favourite beers. Top 3. I prefer it over the 10. The mix of the flavours and just how it's so beautiful tied together is something of beauty."

Popular,Heineken Lager Beer,2.47,"I put together a mix-six at the local supermarket. I included a bottle of Heineken. I hadn't had a Heineken in years--maybe 40; I remember it as a crisp, fresh, beer, much better than the American AALs of the era. I saw the ""malt lager"" appellation on the label, and thought that this must be a new product, an all-malt Heineken. Turns out it's the same, classic Heineken: It's an adjunct based lager, a bit hoppy but with a sweet overlay in the flavor that I suppose is a result of the corn in the recipe. I was a bit surprised by the extent to which I disliked it--I could barely finish the bottle. The sweetness clung to it all the way down. I love all things Dutch--visiting the country, cycling in it, exploring and savoring Amsterdam--with the exception, I guess, of this beer."
Popular,Heineken Lager Beer,2.63,"Poured from a 24oz can best by March 2023 into a pils glass.

On thr pour a fine 3 finger head forms woth a light straw body that has strong carbonation. Head retention is good, but it becomes fizzy looking. Vague lacing.

Aroma is largely light skunked hops, mistreated lager yeast, and some light but bright esters. Maybe some vague corniness but not a lot of malt other than that.

Taste is quite similar to the smell woth the same off notes right up front. As some of the cheap euro characteristics fade a slight floral happiness does stick through in the largely bitter hop extract. Once again a light and oxidized corny maltiness barely shows up on the finish.

Feel is fizzy with a lot of carbonation bite. It's easy to drink but not the smoothest from all the off flavors. Not as watery as expected but bretty light. Longer finish but not great.

Overall this is a meh beer that's overpriced I only picked it up because it's the last thing that isn't a high gravity malt liquor left that I haven't reviewed out of the 24oz singles at my local shitty liquor store. I wish it was maltier, but I guess the hops are actually detectable albeit gross."

Taste explodes in the mouth - a bit of lemon, spices and a pleasant hint of yeast. This is an excellent beer - it hides the 8.5% abv pretty well and never feels hot. Taste lingers on the palate in a pleasant way and makes you want more. Excellent!"
Popular,Tank 7,4.24,"Generically rated as I haven't had it in awhile, but easily a favorite of mine. Has any eggy yeast taste that leaves me craving more. Personally one of my top 5 favorite."
Popular,Tank 7,4.79,"This is my first rating and I’m learning about beer as I go, but I felt compelled to talk about one of my favorites.

Brewed in Kansas City Missouri

Smell of banana with a medium sour aftertaste. Refreshing but also filling."
Popular,Tank 7,4.43,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Color is a pale amber with a two and a half finger head. Decent lacing. Fluffy head like a Coke Float. Hazy, foggy. The fluffy head stays and stays.

S - Yeast front and center on the scent. Sweet and earthy. Some citrus or pear skin as well. Sour scents as well.

T - Taste follows scent. Yeast and sweetness. Like sourdough with sweet cream butter spread across it.

F - Medium to thick mouthfeel with some frothiness.

O - Overall this beer is a treat. Wonderful yeast flavors. I was introduced to Boulevard by a friend from Kansas City, and Tank 7 has been a favorite for years. It’s definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a yeast beer."

Apricot and lemon nose with some yeast character. Stone fruit, grassy hop bitterness and white pepper (?) spice. Drinkability is high - packs a punch at 8.5%. Medium body with high carbonation. Long, fruity and dry finish. Outstanding."
Popular,Tank 7,4.53,"Look: hazy gold, nice white head, good lacing.

Smell: A little banana-y, definitely belgian-y.

Taste: the banana backs off, other eaters still present. Note of cloves. Some malty sweetness as you would expect, followed by a mild lemonish dryness that cleans the palate.

Feel: the fizz is just right, lightens the feel well.

Overall: it is, in fact, an American Saison. It brings in the base flavors of a Saison Dupont, but lightens them, with more emphasis on the hop/citrus."

Great wine, orange, bready yeast flavors.
Unique flavor combination. Smooth mouthfeel with no alcohol heat. Lasting carbonation.
ABV is too high to drink all day, but wonderful in moderation."
Popular,Tank 7,4.4,"While not a perfect traditional version Saison, this beer has become a essential household favorite. I was extremely skeptical at first because my standard for Saisons is high. This beer pours a clear golden into a tulip glass and holds a clean white head, but not too much. Finishes distinctly edgier than that a traditional Saison, but the bittering hops resemble a slightly citrusy and grapefruitlike finish. As an individual and enjoyable beer, I cant find many faults. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It finishes clean and crisp. On occasion during the lakefront summers, I add a splash of lemonade. Of the zillions of beers the Boulevard makes, this is my crown jewels favorite of theirs."
Popular,Tank 7,4.21,"Extremely pretty beer. Bright, orangey yellow with a strikingly white head. Nose is Belgian yeast with subtle barnyard notes. In the mouth it's soft at first, with prickly carbonation coming to the fore as the beer sits on the tongue.

There's the usual Saison peppery, funky yeast profile and candy sugar sweetness that dominates at first, with some American hop character following, mainly on the orange/grapefruit side of the spectrum.

Beer finishes dry and peppery.

Very nice beer!"
Popular,Tank 7,3.94,"Hazy bright gold with a tower of snow white foam that rings + sheets; challah dough and musty lemon rind with bits of bubblegum, white pepper + flowers; honey on fresh bread, pears, marmalade, a bit of cellar, slight rubber bands + pepper, then herbal, grassy, spicy finish; med, thick, smooth, no heat.

4.25 4 4 3.75 3.75

A good looker, and the nose says a lot: sweet, low on phenols, high on esters, and with a thread of farmhouse.
The taste is as advertised: orchard fruit esters piling onto a pils + candy sugar base (I’m guessing) with not quite enough pepper or clove, but an unexpected hint of earth instead, then a bunch of hop aromas without much bitterness.
This is too sweet, both literally + sensually. The main thing about saison, to me, is the dryness, and regardless of the final gravity, this doesn’t give the impression of finishing dry. You’d never call this “crisp”.
I’ve heard it’s American hops in here; if so, they’re boosting the esters with citrus + other fruit where they shouldn’t be. And the 38 IBUs need to be closer to 45 or even 50.
Don’t get me wrong, the craftsmanship is on point: handsome, burn-free, and goes down easy.
And I read where this is a food beer; I can see that - it *needs* food to cut through all the fruit on show here.
But it’s not what the Belgians call “digestible” - and whatever its other merits, I can’t forgive it that.

I wanted to love this, and it’s tasty, but I didn’t want a second."

Popular,Tank 7,4.22,"This is GREAT for a saison. A little strong, of course. If you can stand certain IPAs, and love Boulevard's other exceptional releases, then this is for you."
Popular,Tank 7,4.23,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $13.99. I purchased this in early February 2021, even though it was from a high-turnover store, and it was canned on 8/19/20 (best by May 2021). So it's over 15 months old. No big deal though as I've had this beer aged and I've had it relatively fresh and it was enjoyable either way.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a frothy, thick, rocky off-white head and a subtle haze. The head slowly subsided to almost nothing, but left behind some nice lacing.

Smell: Very aromatic with notes of citrus - lemon peel and grapefruit pith and zest - along with pepper and funky saison yeast. Smells both hoppy and dry. The nose is also somewhat ""juicy"". Makes me think that it is going to be mouth-watering and refreshing. A bit of alcohol on the nose as it warms.

Taste: Delicious. Amazing that this beer, in a can, has such a long shelf life. It may have lost some of its hoppy aromatic qualities and brightness, but it is still good. While the nose gives the impression that the beer is going to be juicy, this beer is far from it on the palate. Up front, it's slightly sweet and citrusy. There is a grainy, bready maltiness that comes through in spite of the hops. The effervescent beer quickly transitions to its spicy, bitter, extremely dry, grapefruit pithy finish that lingers super long on the palate. It's crazy that this beer is 8.5% ABV. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and I would have believed you if you told me that this is 6.0% ABV. The ""funkiness"" is reserved and I don't get any off those off-putting medicinal flavors that sometimes come along with other farmhouse ales.

Feel: The carbonation is perfect and the body is medium. Nice mouthfeel.

Overall: What a great hoppy American saison. It's awesome that this beer is so good and so accessible, coming from a brewery with such wide distribution as Boulevard. I do think that I prefer this beer when it is fresher. Even still, it is solid and it has developed a different character with a bit of age on it."
Popular,Consecration,4.54,"Incredible. Best sour ale on the market. Beautiful cabernet flavor with notes of raspberry, oak, currant, blackberry, and orange. It's as complex as wine while still being beer. I hope they offer it in more stores."

Taste- Black currant, black pepper, brett, plum, blackberry, black cherry, transitions during the sip from sweet/sour to just sour.

Feel- Between medium and full body, very mouth watering upfront, highly dry at finish, soft, silky, sour finish, moderately mouth coating, below average carbonation.

Overall- Highly complex beer with an abundance of flavor and a powerful bouquet. Nice balance of plum, black currant, blackberry, and black cherry made for a wonderful experience."

The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.
The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.
Thanks Jay, this was amazing!"
Popular,Consecration,4.41,"Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.

Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.

Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing.

Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

750mL bottle (batch 003X3) poured into a snifter. Pours a clear mahogany with minimal head, champagne carbonation. A ring of bubbles forms around the edge of the glass.

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.

Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

This is not a beer I would drink every day, but definitely worth revisiting once in a while."
Popular,Consecration,4.31,"375ml bottle, tulip, bottled 2/26/20.

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam.

It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness.

Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries.

Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick.

When I picked this bottle up last year I was surprised I hadn’t had Consecration. It’s just a super well done beer."
Popular,Consecration,4.21,"Brief Review:

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better."
Popular,Consecration,4.4,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 7-12-21; consumed 5-3-22.

Beer poured a red wine color with a fizzy carbonated head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is cherry and strawberry forward and red wine barrel that gives a touch of leather.

Taste is a wonderful balance of leather, red wine vinegar, cherries and strawberries, finishing very clean with each sip.

Mouthfeel is light and delightfully smooth.

Overall a really well executed beer!"

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather

Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%

Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall"
Popular,Consecration,4.5,"Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging.

Popular,Consecration,4.75,"I've had this beer since 2011 and it's from when they were still doing batch numbers rather than bottling dates.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.
T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience."

Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present.

The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical.

The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky.

The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.

This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!"
Popular,Consecration,4.24,"Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head.

If there's a category of girl friendly "" chick-beer"", - this is it. Corona's downside, or greatest marketing, is the clear glass because the longer in the shelf the worst it taste.

These days almost anyone’s local brewery probably makes a better Mexican lager, if that’s what you are in the mood for."
Popular,Corona Extra,3.84,"Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly fizzles away.

The taste is pretty much the same as the nose. Green apple skins, grainy, lightly sweet, hints of corn, a little bit of white flowers and grass on the back end. Zero bitterness. Finishes as crisp as the aforementioned apple.

Mouthfeel is...fine? Light but not watery. Fizzy. Drinks like a pretty typical carbonated beverage. Super crisp and clean, though. Almost nothing is residual.

Wow. I was surprised by how much I liked this, at least from this format. A skunky bottle might have given me a more negative impression. This is a solid, refreshing corn lager. If you go in thirsty with no aloft expectations, you'll probably enjoy it, too!"
Popular,Corona Extra,3.38,"consumed straight from the 12oz clear glass bottle. typical cheap, easy drinking lager smell and taste. nothing fancy but i think that’s the idea here. i can kind of see why they add a lime to this beer as it helps offset the somewhat “cheaper” beer flavor with some citrusy zest. decent mouthfeel though. it’s got some bubbly carbonation and crispness to it. it’s not a half bad thirst quencher on a hot day. personally, i’d take modelo or pacifico over this."
Popular,Corona Extra,2.79,"Poured into a pils glass from a 24oz can best by December 2022

On the pour a decent head forms then immediately dissipates entirely. Body is a golden yellow with average carbonation, crystal clear.

Aroma is skunked, even in the can. I wonder if getting the beer lightstruck is part of the process. It still has some detectable not ruined hops but even so there is some cheap lager aroma here as well. Not bad but not great. Some vague sweet malts are detectable under everything else going on.

Flavor is quite similar to the smell, but with less lager flavor although retaining the skunkiness. Some hop bitterness is there but the skunk is present the whole time. A corny light and sweet malt finish does come eventually after a weird tartness subsides, no wonder people drink this with lime.

Feel is easy drinking crisp and very highly carbonated. Quite light but has a surprisingly long finish that is actually pleasant.

Overall this is a pretty flavorful lawnmower beer that still feels light. Hops are present unlike a lot of beers in the category but there's also a lot off about it. Nothing disgusting as I think a lot of it is intentional but I've had better."

Taste is fairly mild, but dominated by the yeasty funk. Grassiness follows, then maybe a little grainy sweetness. A surprising bitterness builds, and I get a little lemon zest.

My continuation for beers I usually would not consume. The beer is 44 degrees and served in an IPA glass. The pour created a two-fingered off-white head. The head retention is excellent; it slowly dissipated, leaving some lacing on the glass. An amber yellow with orange hues, charting around SRM 7. This beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles.

I first smell floral esters, pine, herbal, and biscuits. Nosing further, I recognize lightly toasted malts, grapefruit, a hint of dankness, a touch of mango, and pineapple.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, pine resin, herbal, biscuity, lightly toasted malts, pineapple, and grapefruit.

The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.

Popular,Old Chub,4.01,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 12-7-2021

On the pour a nice, tan, 3 finger head forms filling my pint glass, it then recedes over a couple minutes to a thin foam cap and ring around the glass. The color is a very dark reddish brown that becomes a dark brown red in the light. Lazy carbonation finds its way to the surface.

Smell is quite roasty but with strong notes of dried date from the mingling of yeast and malts. Some vague hopping possibly detected? Definitely a complex malt forward traditional scotch ale smell. Quite sweet.

Taste follows the smell but brings more roast amd leaves a little bit of the dark fruitiness. It is still present but it shows up more with the slight wave of bitterness after the sweet caramel malt notes pass. The bitterness does build a bit as you drink, as well as sweet yeast character. Quite a complex beer, quite low ibu I'm assuming however.

Feel is quite velvety, and not too heavy especially for the abv. It does stay on the palate a bit and Definitely isn't watery but it is very easy to drink.

Overall a traditional scotch ale from an American brewery. And a very interesting yeast and malt character at that. Some hops present in the form of a vague bitterness, but quite earthy and sweet. This is good."

The flavor starts sweet, some cocoa, a touch of coffee, then there is a crisp dryness with a little alcohol bite at the finish .
The palate feels a smoothness up front, a slight dryness, and a little heat from the 8% ABV.
This tastes very good and I keep going back for more, but I suggest you sip this one and enjoy. I think this one could sneak up on a guy!"
Popular,Old Chub,4.18,"Brownish red color with a half inch of light tan head. The nose is chocolate, toasted whole wheat bread, rye, wet grain, and a touch of coffee. The taste is almond toffee, brown bread, molasses, hazelnuts with the skin on, roasted corn, and a delicious maltiness. Very nicely balanced beer that goes from mildly sweet to barely dry to a light lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess that borders on chewy. The key here is the malty grainy toffee taste. This is a very good drinkable beer."
Popular,Old Chub,4.43,"Very good beer, complex and chewy, woodsy flavors of maple syrup, raisin, butterscotch, cocoa, toasted bread, caramel, vanilla, licorice. The expected sweetness for the style is nicely balanced by a touch of bitterness and even a hint of minty pine as the flavors linger. Excellent smooth rich feel, thick but not sticky, with a great jolt of lively fizz. My personal favorite of the Scotch ales. A malt monster, not for hopheads. An excellent beer as close to flawless as I've had."
Popular,Old Chub,4.04,"Deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, nut, cocoa, and dark fruits. Taste is sweet of cola and dark cherries, nutty roasted malts and a definite smoked flavor. Some marshmallow as well. Nice medium chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol is held in check by the full malt flavors and overall this is a nice ale."
Popular,Old Chub,4.04,"12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Canned 3/26/21.

S---Sweet malty goodness. Caramel, dark fruits, bread.

T---Follows the nose closely.

F---it's a wee heavy.

O---A really nice one. I'd get this again."
Popular,Old Chub,4.2,"355 mL can from the LCBO; dated Aug 14 2020 and served barely chilled. This is the last of a 4-pack that I bought in late 2020.

Pours a muddied brownish-amber colour, with a deliberately rough pour producing half an inch of foamy beige head. It leaves behind a thin collar, but little else worth mentioning - though a good swirl does leave some spotty lacing and legs behind. Mostly just sweet on the nose - lots of caramel and toffee, with notes of cherry red licorice candy, dates and figs; these obscure subtler suggestions of toasted bread, molasses, plum and alcohol.

A fine beer, indeed - complex and flavourful, though the scales are certainly tipped toward the 'malt' side of the equation, with an almost fruit cake-like flavour at the forefront. There's caramel, toffee, toasted bread and molasses, as well as cherry, prune, date and fig; hints of cocoa and smoked malt at the finish, leading in to a slightly warming aftertaste with lingering hints of toffee, earthiness and dark fruits, as well as a touch of booziness. Medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that weakly brush against the surface of the tongue; feels smooth and a little slick on the palate. If you've got more than one can, you might want to pace yourself - it's easy to pour down the hatch, but as Samuel Jackson once said, it'll get'cha drunk.

Final Grade: 4.2, an awesome A-. Old Chub has been on my wants list for a couple years, and I'm thrilled to strike it off. I don't know if this is the best scotch ale I've ever had - it's tasty for sure, with a varied array of flavours, and the 8% is exceedingly well-integrated. That being said, the smoked malt aspects are fairly subtle, and overall it's a little sweet for my tastes - minor flaws for this style, of course, if they can even be considered flaws in the first place. If you see this beer and are in any way curious, do not hesitate to purchase it - I'll be doing so again at the first opportunity."
Popular,Old Chub,4.29,"Pours deep mahogany with amber glints and a small toffee colored head. Huge raisin, caramel, stewed fruit notes in the nose. The taste is intensely malty with roasty notes mixed with berry and fruity notes. Leafy, woody hops in the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Cherry, chocolate and roasted barley notes in the finish.

A nice Wee Heavy. Very malty and complex. A must try if you like malty beers."

Medium-to-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel. Alcohol is warming but not intrusive. Overall, just really nice and pleasant."
Popular,Old Chub,3.78,"On tap at Das Beer Garden. Deep brown. Smells of toffee and caramel. Light butterscotch notes.

Mostly tastes like a big, sweet brown ale, but hints of the scotch ale come back in the back end."
Popular,Old Chub,4.15,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber with a tiny head that dissolved pretty quickly, however, there was some nice lacing left behind.

Smells mainly of caramel malts, toffee, coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit.

This brew evolved as it warmed, initially when it was cold I was only able to pick up the caramel and the coffee up front with a hint of the dark fruit, but the latter flavors and aroma came alive once it warms up. When it warms it approaches cloying, however I am completely fine with that because sweet beers are my thing. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty tasty brew, cheers! Only thing that's somewhat disappointing is that I'm not picking up much of the smokiness. I paired this with lamb chops."

rightfully a classic of the style. The 2018 bottle is very smooth and although I taste the alcohol, it's very easy to drink. The bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced. As it should be, the mouthfeel is thinner than a BA stout. This is a wonderful world class beer and always worth having on your shelf or fridge."
Popular,§ucaba,4.54,"Had the 2018 version, on tap at Other Half DC

Dark, mostly opaque reddish brown, still somewhat see through, tan head.

Raisin, boozy, maple, toffee, oak, fig jam on the nose. Taste follows, but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig, raisin, clove, toasted sugar, chocolate.

Probably best barleywine I’ve ever had, boozy but not over powering, somehow everything seems in place (where I often find barley wines to be unbalanced in one way or another)"
Popular,§ucaba,4.5,"12 ounce bottle, 2019 vintage. 01/19/2019 is stamped on the neck of the bottle, I'm assuming that's the bottled on date. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. If you're into English style barleywines then definitely pick this one up, I'm glad I did!"

Popular,§ucaba,4.54,"No head, hazy caramel brown body. Smell is rich— bourbon whisky dominates, with caramel malt, figs, tobacco, and a healthy rye spice. Taste is more subtle than expected. Figs, brown sugar, whisky, cherry, just a hint of coconut, vanilla, and lots of rye spice. Smooth drinking. Nice alcohol warmth. Not as overpowering as expected, which is good.

In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty. Yum a dum, dum. I could have sat on this another five years, but I just had to try it now.

Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese

Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.

First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this.

Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.

On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)

At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.

I need to revisit this one."
Popular,§ucaba,4.63,"Poured cold into a tulip glass and allowed to warm to cellar temperature. Dark brown in color (I'm guessing around 40 EBC), with a thick tan head that left some nice lacing as it settled. There's nothing subtle about this one.

Lots of grassy hop notes touch the nose. There is a herbal quality there too.

The sip keeps the grassy and herbal notes going. A light grainy character sits in behind. It’s all punctuated by a crisp almost spicy finish.

Light bodied, well carbonated and very enjoyable.

This is an excellent American Pilsner. Up there with my favourites from Suarez, Live Oak and Olde Mecklenberg."
Popular,Prima Pils,4,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. This beer is often available in mix-a-six packs for $2/bottle. Says Best By 12 Apr 22; it's about 5 weeks past that date.

Look: Golden light straw color with a very small white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising up. Has the slightest chill haze.

Smell: Smells lemony, spicy, and earthy. There is a nice bready malt backbone with a good amount of sweetness too (think apple juice). I think there's a bit of skunkiness here too, and I'm okay with that. After swirling the glass, I get green bell pepper notes on the finish.

Taste: This is a very traditional German pilsner style. It's very light and slightly sweet on the palate up front, and the finish is crisp and bitter. This beer is very hoppy but it's not resiny at all; the hop character is slightly floral, but mostly citrusy and the finish is rindy / pithy without being juicy at all. A lot of spicy character also...lingering on my palate is an almost peppery, earthy flavor. There is a bit of skunkiness, but it's my own fault for not drinking and reviewing this sooner. That being said, I don't really mind it so it's all good.

Feel: Light to medium mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is appropriate. Very easy drinking.

Overall: This is renowned to be one of the better American-made Pilsners and I would say that it lives up to the hype. It's very easy to drink and fairly enjoyable without being boring. I just wish that it was easier to find this beer fresh; even though I live just outside of Philadelphia, it's not so easy to find and when you find it, it's often not so fresh. I think that's because so much of America is suffering from IPA-itis, a lot of beer stores are not having high turnover with beers like Victory Prima Pils so it tends to sit on the shelves for a while or a lot of stores have even stopped carrying it. I also with that Victory would brew their Home Grown Lager again, but that's a discussion topic for another time.

From the bottle:
A crisp yet distinct Pilsner brewed with German hops that bring vivid notes of floral and spice with citrus and lemon. This is truly brilliant, bringing nuanced complexity together with smooth, easy drinking.

Popular,Prima Pils,4.53,"I have never reviewed what is probably my most drank beer of all time so here we go…

Pours beautifully light straw color, crystal crystal clear. Vigorous pour leaves a nice big fluffy white head with good retention and some nice lacing to.

Smell is so much grass, spicy and floral hops and a bright snappy maybe grainy malt aroma.

Taste leans into the hops as well, the floral hop bite show more in the taste than nose. Grassy and cracker like and spicy hop finish.

Super super clean and easy to drink, dry and nice bitter finish. Grassy like bitterness that lingers well after the sip is gone, the dry finish enhances this aspect in a very nice way.

If you haven’t drank this beer go try it."

Popular,Prima Pils,3.27,"Labeled German Style Pilsner. Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils.

Sweet cracker malt, mowing sweet grass, and a whiff of sulphur.

The initial taste is corn and crackers. That sweet corn remains an undertone to very floral, sweet grassy hops that carry me through to a slightly herbal, crisp finish.

Rather a full body, but crisp with plenty of carbonation.

For some reason I had always thought this was a bohemian pilsner, probably because it’s hoppier than most German pils, which is also what makes it more to my liking."

Taste has a big sweet backbone but it's overwhelmed by the bitter roasted malt. Great malt profile that's hard to place. Dark chocolate and coffee notes, but that's a bit of a cop out to describe what's a more complicated malt taste. Spicy warming boozy finish. The most noteworthy thing here is how surprisingly balanced and drinkable this is. Heavy for sure, but it goes down dangerously easy. Nicely carbonated.

Smell - Dark roasted character primarily. Then some caramel and chocolate and vanilla, and alcohol. It really doesn't hide the alcohol very well. 4.25

Taste - Dark roasted coffee. I just now read the description on the back label and it literally says word for word ""dark roasted coffee"". So yeah, it sure lives up to that. Baker's cocoa noticeable too, as it notes. It's not bad by any means. But this style has very stiff competition, and I rate within style. 4

Mouthfeel - A little harsh. Boozy. Full bodied. But a relatively clean finish for the style, which isn't saying too much. 4

Popular,Narwhal,4.1,"I can't say much that hasn't been said, so cutting to the chase this is a very good RIS deserving of the rating.

It pours a thick looking oily black, very clear.

The smell is of chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, char, molasses and I think just a hint of licorice.

What I find surprising in the taste is the chocolate, but this is fresh and I look forward to letting this age and seeing how it changes, but right now I am getting a significant chocolate flavor, that seems slightly sweet at first but as the coffee and roasted malt takes over, the sweet sensation fades to a hefty but short-lived combo bite of char, espresso, acridity, and some bitterness. Coffee acridity and char lingers a little, but pleasantly.

Even young, no alcohol beyond a pleasant warmth. I'd call it medium body, somewhat creamy, just enough carbonation to hold it up. Glad I have five more to play with later, anticipating this to be even better with some time."

Popular,Finestkind IPA,4.24,"You’ve been in class all day; tissues, pathways, mechanisms ring through your head with no sign of slowing soon. Its 7:30pm, and the sun has already near set across the Somerville sky. Brain exhausted and eyes strained, you close out your last Zoom call, shut your laptop and make your way to the balcony outside for some fresh air. To your immediate surprise, instead of the typical metro humidity and busyness, you’re met with a cool, crisp, natural breeze. Fall is here. The North is calling. You immediately know what to do ; you traipse back inside to their fridge and crack a Smutty. The Finest Kind. Notes of pine and grass complete the symphony; the briskness of arriving autumn tapered by the flowing IPA approaching your extremities... warmth. You don’t just feel home, you ARE home. That is what Smuttynose’s Finest Kinda does for you, and for that reason it has earned a spot in my fridge. Cheers."
Popular,Finestkind IPA,3.84,"Pours... well I don't know. I had 3 of them within their own cans. The aroma is hop-forward with a hint of citrus, maybe pineapple? The taste can be described as 'woodsy' with an emphasis on floral hops with a resinous finish. One of the strengths of this beer is its smoothness. Although it is 6.9%, it could pass for 5% or lower."
Popular,Finestkind IPA,3.96,"Pours golden yellow with a 1/2 inch white head, which dissipates. Light lacing.

Popular,Finestkind IPA,4.03,"Appearance:
A misty, dark yellow; the color of a sunflower’s iris. Proffers up a big, soapy, head of white that skips town before the party starts. Leaves no trace of lace.

Bouquet:
A hushed duet of semi-sweet hops and tiny speckles of pineapple. Fresh citrus cuts in front of these quiet performers, playing a lurid yet catchy jazz solo which nearly tunes them out.

Feel:
A slick, medium body with a nearly impalpable booze finish that has the gentle warmth of a springtime sunrise. The carbonation plays a subtle yet imperative, supporting role.

Taste:
A drizzle of pineapple syrup over a fistful of tangy, citrus hops. Any potential acidic bitterness is bumped out of the picture by a biscuity, malt backbone."

Popular,Newcastle Brown Ale,2.68,"Ok. Ordered it thinking it was an English Brown Ale, but it was nothing special. I understand why now that I’ve read some recent reviews about it being sold to Lagunitas and not what it once was. I would agree it was somewhat syrupy. Ok to drink if nothing else malt forward available."
Popular,Newcastle Brown Ale,1.22,"This is an incredibly disappointing beer. I could end there but will keep going...

Purchased at Purvis Beer in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, in Australia in November 2021.

The beer looks more like a soft drink in the glass than a beer. Its clarity is astounding for a brown beer; it's a burnished copper with light brown highlights where the light reflects from the glass. But that is as good as this beer gets.

Aroma-wise, there's a sweet, syrupy cola/Dr.Pepper mix that brought to the fore thoughts of fly spray and even citronella. There was nothing appealing at all about the smell, in fact quite the opposite.

Taste is no improvement on the smell. It's as sweet as the aroma hints, and there's that cola/Dr.Pepper thing going on. It's clearly a light struck beer as evidenced by the skunky, metallic taste that overrides everything else.

In the mouth it's thin and light, just like a soft drink.

Overall this is a disappointing shell of a beer. I understand it's now brewed under licence, and can only presume it's been bastardised in the name of fiscal efficiency. Well, I can't imagine ever paying to drink this beer again, so I suppose it will help with my fiscal efficiency, so mission accomplished?

Cheers!"
Popular,Newcastle Brown Ale,1.63,"Gave the look a four because it looks like a Newcastle Brown Ale. However, my understanding is that this is now a Lagunitas product. Combined with the recipe change five or six years ago, the firm’s obstinate refusal to do away with the clear glass that ruins the beer and selling out to macro garbage like Lagunitas, this is undrinkable swill. One of the admonishments from BA is that we’re supposed to be respectful of the brewer. That statement is obviously ridiculous, taken out of context. I understand the idea behind it though. As such, I didn’t give it straight ones.
I have had Newcastle Brown Ale in not a few pubs across the pond, as far back as 1997. Reviewing that beer would be a wonderful time. Drinking this (er, taking two swallows and pouring out the rest) was such a departure from those halcyon days, I may have unconsciously used this beer as a stand in for my deep regret of having returned to the Disneyland Freakshow States of Oligopoly.
Whatever the case, this is tragic. No, this was never the finest beer. But it was relatively inexpensive and decent (out of a keg) - pretty much the opposite of whatever this is."
Popular,Newcastle Brown Ale,3.91,"Drank this so much and so often in the 90s I certainly tried, and failed, to replicate it when I took up brewing. Wasn't even close, enjoy one very now and again, but of course there's better browns about these days."

Popular,Newcastle Brown Ale,2.83,"They can do better. The first time I made my own beer for a youtube video, I made a kit called ""back to basics beer"" It was nothing fancy, 6.6 pounds of DME, some copper colored grain in a bag some hops and Nottingham yeast packet. My beer, with mistakes I made like squeezing the bag, stirring the wort, not mixing the priming sugar with hot water and some other rookie mistakes, my beer came out tasting better than a New Castle Brown Ale. NCBA is good with making beer bread with it, but not drinking it. This is just okay I prefer Bass Ale over NCBA."

The aroma is light bready malts.
The flavor starts with a crispness up front, the light hops, giving way to sweet caramel malt flavor.

Body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting.

The nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts. Very pleasing.

The body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness. Chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish.

Mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high ABV. The powerful flavor more than compensates.

Coffee fans must track this beer down. You'll thank me later."

As with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor , semivsweet chocolate, cacao, dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness (coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all, very mild) .

Popular,Péché Mortel,4.42,"Bottled on 1/27/2022. Poured into a stout glass at 59°. It pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy, toffee-colored head and lacing. It smells of freshly-brewed coffee, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco smoke, and nutty char. The coffee in the flavor is strong, burnt, and acidic. It combines with baker's chocolate, burnt nuts, and earthy char and is as dry and roasty as they come. There is just a hint of chocolate and caramel sweetness but this is a bitter brew. The flavors are big and bold and it finishes with a strong dose of hop bitterness. Delicious! The mouthfeel is creamy but not quite as viscous as I'd expected. It's moderately carbonated and isn't overly boozy for 9.5% ABV. Overall, this is the quintessential coffee stout. I'd recommend against drinking it before bed if you want to sleep. I don't know why Dieu du Ciel doesn't distribute to northern New Jersey but now that I can find it in South Jersey or eastern Penna. I'll be sure to stock up."

Looks like any other deep black imperial stout does. Beautiful black in colour with small brown head, leaves some lacing.
Smells like roasted malt with some subtle dark roast coffee. Very inviting.
The taste of this beer is amazing. Nice roasted malt, caramel malt, coffee, and some vanilla maybe in the back. Some chocolate notes and brown sugar are present as well and it's all very well balanced. I didn't notice any of the fruit notes other people have reported. I drank the bottle in like 2 minutes without even noticing so this is definitely a dangerous drinker.
The mouthfeel was quite pleasant and full bodied. Doesn't coat the mouth but has that medium-full body with light-medium carbonation.
Overall at $14 for 4 bottles this beer is insane. This is the best overall Canadian beer I've ever found and I love Dieu du Ciel. Such a great beer and huge recommend for anyone with access to it."
Popular,Péché Mortel,4.32,"Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good looking Imperial Stout.

Mouth-feel: Medium bodied with a generous level of carbonation. Not the thickest stout but it still has a good mouthfeel.

Overall: A good coffee stout. The flavor profile is that of a prototypical stout with a real roasted malt backbone plus a nice coffee presence. A good pastry stout is tasty but sometimes it's good to go back to the basics."
Popular,Péché Mortel,4.7,"Purchased based on a rave review from Foss Co. in Golden, an accolade to take very seriously. Still, at $5/12 oz I wasn't expecting something quite this ... exceptional. By appearance it's an average imperial stout, jet black with a thin tan head, but oh wow. The reviewer who called it ""something like hard cold brew"" pretty much nailed it. Delicately chocolaty and dark fruity, with a seamlessly integrated bitterness upon a clean but comforting body. An elegant palette of bold and beautiful flavors that never overstay their welcome.

With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect.

The presentation is above average for a higher octane Imperial Stouts. Aroma is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate... deeply roasted malts, with hints of toffee, spice, prunes and a little alcohol booze. Taste is even more chocolate. Rich dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate pudding, vanilla (like Oreos and milk), something nutmeg-like and alcohol spice. Puts me in mind of a deeply chocolate eggnog (if there is such a thing). There is little alcohol booze (for the ABV) and a faint hint of dark fruit. Velvety smooth in the finish it has almost no prickle between the finish and aftertaste but the hint is there. The aftertaste is earthy, chocolate, slightly bitter, roasted and burnt.

The aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.
The taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip.
The feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.
OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.

Poured from a Michigan exclusive release can into an IPA glass.

Smell is peppery and malty, slightly sweet. Pleasant, not overly intrusive.

Taste follows the nose but much, much stronger. Peppery bite up front, followed by the sweet from the red ale characteristics. Finish is a lingering rye pepper flavor. Excellent and memorable.

Medium bodied, smoother than you would expect mouthfeel.

Overall, this is a delicious beer that is also interesting to drink. I'm so glad that they are packaging this beer again after a long hiatus, and consider myself lucky to be a Michigan native so that I can get this beer easily."

Poured into a Mad Bomber IPA glass, this had a nice, but, fluffy, beige colored head that sat on top of a dark copper, slightly red colored beer with some nice clarity. Said head took a long time to drop and left lots of lace behind.

Peppery, spicy Amarillo hop and rye malt notes greeted the workers at my olfactory. Some sweet, bready malt notes as well.

Taste is spicy and peppery up front. Earthy, Rye malt flavor comes to the fore especially at the fadeout. Fairly good-sized, bready malt backbone to this, which isn't surprising given it's midwest DNA, but is not sufficiently massive to be disturbing to a PNWer like me!

Medium bodied, with an almost creamy mouthfeel.

I am a little baffled by this one.
It's a garnet tinged amber color. Light sandy head that rises a finger or so, loosens up, and quickly recedes. (I'm assuming it would have a little more head retention had I opened earlier).
Really pretty color.
Smells of rye, some earthy hops, and a hint of caramel malt.
Taste is rye, buckwheat, a tad of pine resin, with a gentle almost floral honey note. Also a smooth pepper note peeks in.
Mouthfeel is slightly less than medium. Low carbonation. Finish is a tad slick.
Overall, I'm guessing a rye IPA, or an Amber ale with some rye in the mix.
So what is it?"

Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!"
Popular,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.18,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.

The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.

The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.

Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".

Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done."
Popular,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.34,"From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The ""oaking"" process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste."

Aroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place. The pieces don’t come together here.

Popular,OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.6,"A- Probably the best write up anyone will come across on a beer bottle haha!! This pours with a great caramel colored head that is dense, starts off about a finger thick and has awesome retention. The beverage itself is muddied, brown and with plenty of visible suspended yeast particulate. The carbonation seems to be plentiful and smooth. As for lacing, it is really nice, with lots of small circular clumps of foam stickily hanging on to the side of the glass.

S- First impression.....wood chips, and of campfire! Beyond this there is vanilla, slight coffee and chocolate notes, some dense dried apple, caramel and toffee sweet malts and the finish is rummy sweet yet bitter from the hops....a very nice balancing act between rich & malty, oak, and bitter.

T- The flavors follow suit to the aromas, with the richness of the rum coming through very well....almost liqueur like. I am getting beautiful caramel/toffee sweetness, vanilla, oak cask, some campfire smoke. The bulk of the beer is yeasty, bread like, of cream, nuttiness.....just a full spectrum of balanced goodness!

M/O- Mouthfeel is creamy medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is about as smooth as one can get! I give this full marks for drinkability and I'd love nothing more than to enjoy more than one of these delectable Ales.....the alcohol is so well hidden you don't even know there is any.....what a delight to drink! Simply awesome and worthy of being one of my favorite beers!"

Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.66,"355 ml bottle, vintage 2013, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. BB date 31.05.2014. Amber colour, moderate off-white head.

Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.64,"Poured from a Sierra Nevada sampler 12-pack glass bottle into a flared-lip tulip/IPA-style custom drinking glass. Very thick white head that stayed resilient for a short while. You can taste the rye backing up the hops with this one. Has a slightly different bitter background other than hops. Finishes less dry than other IPA's. Has a mild sweetness that blends well. The nose is more prominent than other in this sampler pack. Almost rustic; sweet, pleasant and malty. A darker color than usual IPA's, as to be expected with the rye. A brown color, almost like an amber beer was mixed with 1/4th west coast ipa. In the nucleated glass I poured it into, its maintained persistent carbonation bubbles rising to the top. More so than a lot of other IPA's to an extent. Not overly carbonated though. Maintains a thin, but thicker than usual lacing even minutes later. A good amount of carbonation, maybe the slightly higher end but still in a good way, as per usual with most Sierra Nevada beer's I've tried so far.

Overall a tasty beer and a nice experience, coming from someone new to rye beers."
Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,4.19,"Poured from a bottle , almost clear amber/copper color with bubbly off white head leaving substantial thick bubbly lacing. Nose is spicy and malty with hints of piney hops. Taste follows with a touch more peppery spice, nice rye overtones. This is quite flavorful and a fine IPA."
Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.77,"Poured a clear burnt orange color. A moderate head with good retention. A sweet citrusy and maltyaroma. The taste is dry, spicy, and quite bitter. A bitter, but pleasant aftertaste. More carbonated than most. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.6,"Pours a clear copper/amber with average head but excellent lacing.

Aromas of bready malt, toasted rye, and hints of citrus.

The flavor carries a wide variety of notes. Bready malt, toasted rye, floral, and citrus all show up until the finish, where the piney hops arrive.

The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, and rather slick, with carbonation lacking.

This is an interesting rye brew but not top flight."
Popular,Ruthless Rye IPA,3.99,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; bottled on 3/18/19.
A: Pours a basically clear (precipitation on the glass made this a tough call), dark amber, really more copper color with one finger, off white head, solid retention, much more than a cap, and lacing.
S: Aromas of mocha, caramel, cocoa, molasses, and light pine.
T: Semisweet. The palate certainly follow the nose, but the caramel/molasses maltiness and piney core is now front and center. Solid bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation and a full, creamy presence.
O: A top shelf Rye IPA. Really a treat."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,3.97,"Dark walnut brown, reddish when light shines through. Tall head with good retention and some lacing. Lots of malty aroma. Malty flavors evolve through different spices and eventually into light smoke late on the long finish. Phenolic. No real alcoholic flavor despite ABV. Good feel in mouth. Gets better the more you drink of it."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a run-away long lived tan head and a lot of lacing.

Smells of toasted malt and yeast with some sweet fruit.

Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, yeast, raisins, plumbs and spice with a warm alcohol finish.

Medium light body and light carbonation after the head recedes. Smooth mouthfeel.

This is one excellent, powerful sipper!"
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.76,"Trois Pistoles pours a ruby red so dark as to be almost black with a thick off-white head that lasts forever.

The aroma brings to mind dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and strawberry jam, with a hint of dark chocolate underneath.

The flavour brings across all those dark fruit notes with just a hint of sweetness, and introduces the dark chocolate notes on the finish. There's a layered complexity and balance to the flavours that I only find in exceptional Belgian beers.

The carbonation is effervescent and gives the beer a really rich, decadent mouth feel. The 9% alcohol is very well hidden.

This is a truly fantastic beer! An awesome Belgian Dark ale, I think it compares very favourably against Quadruples as well. This is one of the tastiest, most complex and well balanced Belgians I've had, and everyone I've introduced this beer to has come away impressed. Unibroue has really outdone themselves here."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.22,"Bottle poured into a nonic

Brewers Notes: Drawing on Quebec folklore, Unibroue chose the name Trois Pistoles to honour the city’s historic importance and pay homage to the legend of the Black Horse. Conjured up by a priest to help build a new church, this incarnation of the devil ran off when its bridle was removed. Because construction was still underway when the horse vanished, a stone remains missing from the church to this day.

Dark cola like liquid capped by a foamy taupe foam which recedes to a thin layer

Aroma is malts, dark fruits , raisins, figs

Taste is dark fruits, figs, raisins , malts

Mouthfeel is soft , fizzy

Good beer"
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.39,"Poured a thundercloud of foam into a Gordon Biersch Maibock glass. The aroma was sweet malty with a hint of coriander. The taste has spice with stone fruit with a medium creamy mouthfeel that easily settles on the palate. Without a hint of the ABV, it's between sippable and crushable, though it's for sipping for flavor."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.26,"A: Pours a deep brown with a brief 3 finger tan head that fades to a smooth cap. It leaves lots of soapy lacing on the sides.

S: Aromas of caramel and molasses. No hop aromas.

T: Taste follows the nose. And with only 15.5 IBUs, you're not going to taste any hops, either.

F: Smooth with tingling carbonation, moderately full bodied. At 9% it's strong, but it's not going to knock you on your butt.

O: Overall, it's a good value. An excellent take on Belgian-style strong dark, by a solid Canadian brewery. This and Maudite are probably my favorites from UniBroue."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.49,"I bought this for the Trippel tasting weekend, not sure why, but here we are. Obviously rating as a Belgian style Dark Ale.
Poured dark, like reddish cola and managed to get about 5 mm of head of beige foam which pretty much stayed the whole time.
The aroma was more dark fruits like raisins and prunes; not sweet at all, very pleasant.
The taste followed, mouth-filling flavor of malty goodness.
The feel was almost viscous, which considering all the flavor and the ABV, it made perfect sense. Excellent sipper.
This one turned out to be a happy mistake, I'll definitely revisit it on purpose."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass

Pours a murky dark mahogany color with some reddish hues, and a medium tan head that recedes quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is sweet; consisting of cherries, raisins, dates, brown sugar, a mild spiciness, and a pronounced booziness.

The flavor follows the nose closely, with a mix raisins, plums, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of spiciness. Also, as with the nose, there is a strong booziness, but not overly strong, just enough to alert you to the 9% abv. Full bodied and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will be revisiting"
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.23,"Pours a cloudy, very dark brown with a finger thick head of tightly packed bubbles.

As with many of Unibroue’s offerings, they have a hallmark style with their Belgians — leans fruity, and leans on the subtler yet complex side of things. This is no different. Complex nose that is hard to pick apart the malty side, spiced fruitcake, gentle cloves, fresh dark fruits like cherry. Molasses and toffee.

Flavour follows the nose pretty tightly. Alcohol is well hidden but the warmth it has adds a dimension to the flavour profile, a woody sherry like flavour. More malt here than on the nose, especially on the finish which recalls toasted bread and spongy chocolate coffered toffee and sugared apples. Bits of yeastiness wax and wane throughout your palate as you sip it.

Incredible mouthfeel. It foams very, very hard in your mouth but the carbonation is not particularly prickly. This gives it a very foamy mouthfeel on the way down. Medium bodied beer that is relatively sweet, no real bitterness here. Medium-high level of carbonation, especially noticeable in that sip, but the carbonation is not overly biting. Nice subtle but long finish leaving a gentle sweetness, yeasty grains, and dark fruits on the palate.

As mentioned before, I find almost all of Unibroue’s offerings to be milder on the flavour strength than Belgian styles from Belgium itself. That doesn’t make it bad, but they lean towards a more mild and complex flavour profile. They also tend to be more fruity than malty, and that is the case here. They write that rum flavours abound in the nose and palate, my experience has been with the fruity side of the beer it has a strong port or sherry side rather than rum, but you can get a rum taste. It’s just not as strong as other Belgian styles or malty Eisbocks.

Overall it’s quite a formidable beer, just as good as anything out of Belgium, while carving out its own unique niche and noticeable flavour profile on its own. At the same time, mild enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker, even though new to the style. Unibroue really does not tend to miss on any of their beers"

Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.36,"A real beauty to look at, from the dark brown body to the large, lasting tan head to the graceful lace. Layers of rich malts in the aroma where you can pick out dark fruit, pitted fruit, molasses, brown bread and probably a few other favorite descriptors. Just don't count on too many hop varieties. Taste leans the same way although the hops come into play a bit more. Spiciness is more noticeable, especially in the aftertaste. Sweetness is a factor while bitterness is minimal. Mouthfeel is full bodied and decently carbonated. Check the ABV before guzzling more than two."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.18,"Thick creamy head that can runaway if not poured carefully. Good amount of lacing that doesn't have any intentions of leaving. Strong dark grainy, slightly sweet smell. Strong sour notes, light bitterness and classic Belgian taste. Somewhat astringent on the backend.

I love Unibroue's offerings and this one doesn't fail to impress. For sure in the top tier Belgians. You can tell it's strong however as the alcohol is present."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,5,"Excellent quality. Belgian ale (Dubbel) Made in Canada. Price is Excellent as well, compared to Belgian dubbels.Dark fruit, cocoa, and smooth. 2 thumbs up."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.04,"It was nice to pick up three Unibroue singles a few weeks ago. This was the one new-to-me brew of the bunch. And what a great brew it is. Unibroue seems to always make very easy drinking versions of styles that are often not the easiest.

This pours a gorgeous deep brown with tons of fine foamy head. The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well. I should get a sixer and put some up.

Recommended. I will be happy to have this again some time - it is a nice and easy version of the style while not being phony or wimpy."
Popular,Trois Pistoles,4.14,"L: Dark brown color, not quite black. Tan tall head that dissipates into a centimeter of coating on top. Moderate lacing that sticks.

S: Black cherries. Sweet malt. Undertones of alcohol. I might be crazy but it smells a little bit like coca-cola.

T: sweet and thick are the dominant characteristics. More dark fruit, cherry and raisin. Bitter/sharp on the back end that can make it feel not as heavy as it really is.

F: medium-full bodied. A nice level of carbonation.

O: close in profile to Belgian darks. Has some interesting qualities of fruit and tartness but still doesn’t top actually Belgian’s to me. Still very good."
Popular,Rouge (Red),4.31,"Popped a big thick 750mL tall brown bottle. Deep amber to the browner end of copper, it pours hazy with yeast and unfiltered goodness and a foamy two and a half finger head that recedes into a spotty cap with thick, clinging ring of foam around the glass. Large bubbles pop up, not in a line, just one by one, from the ethereal dark brown bottom.

Malty, sweet, caramel, yeasty esters on the nose are primary. Doughy and bready, and you’d be forgiven for smelling banana. Particularly good amount of spices, cloves and cinnamon. Little bit peppery but the general character stays to the sweet side and reminds mostly of that.

Flavourful and pleasantly balanced profile, not as strong as their other beers. This can easily be a plus or a minus depending on what you want from your beers. Deep savoury yeasty esters that border on doughy but are more restrained interact with the sweet caramel malt and gentle toasty flavours that never border on cloying. Clove and peppery spices present here. As for fruits, I get a lot less dark fruits than others do. Plum and raisin might be present, but they taste fresh and gentle, and banana is just as present. Maybe it’s the foamy carbonation giving it a lighter touch on my palate or something else. The alcohol is well hidden which likely adds to the lighter character that gives a more spicy-light phenolic touch that leans towards lighter flavours rather than deep raisiny-fig-pudding ones. Definitely some molasses here though.

Medium-ish bodied with a higher level of carbonation, the finish is barely touched by any hops or buttering presence and is lightly sweet, again, not cloying. Bready malts with a touch of yeastiness stays on the palate, and mild spice character reminds, the light pepper impression of white peppercorn and the sweetness and spice of cinnamon, light vanilla, and currants. The good carbonation level and tendency to highly foam when it hits your tongue gives the taste palate a unique spin that is a bit lighter and very nice, it’s not quite creamy or smooth but sort of a merge between them both. I chalk it up to the great way this beer blends palates and tastes.

Ah dubbels, the interesting beer that’s not between, but occupies little spaces between a doppelbocks, Belgian strong dark ales, and Tripels. Hard for me to localize how it fits, and my palate is unrefined, but I try! Chimay Red mixes things together that arguably comes out in a perfect cohesive blend. What can I say? I love malt, sweet, spicy beers. Definitely an excellent offering from Chimay, their Blue still my favourite, but this is as good or potentially better than white? Have to try both again. All the Trappist beers are just delightful, and the yeast is great for my stomach. Excellent beer to round out my 100th review!"
Popular,Rouge (Red),4.37,"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Dark brown thick light tan head on aggressive pour. Minimal lacing. Has alcohol legs

S - Sweet and buttery. Dark fruits. Maybe Mulled wine or after dinner wine in there. There is a caramel scent in it too.

T - Taste follows scent with sweetness and dark fruits. Fig, plum, and possibly banana. Some booziness in the taste. No bitterness at all. There is a malty caramel or toffee that shows up as it warms up.

F - Good carbonation and cola consistency that smooths out as you drink

O - Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Very drinkable with no bitterness (a little booziness) and a lot of flavor. After trying Chimay Blue, White, and Red, I enjoyed this Red a lot. While the Blue seemed like a Winter beer, and the White was a good beer for light hops, the Red seems great for regular drinking and I will definitely add it to my annual rotation."

Popular,Rouge (Red),4.39,"Chimay red was the last of the Chimay range I had the pleasure of trying, as it was difficult to find in my area of Ontario Canada.

Nose: Spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, apple, fig, mild alcohol heat and rich wheat and barley. Somewhat of a grape or red wine scent, currants perhaps.

In the Glass: Bold and beautiful rich frothy head.

Palate: Complex but simplistic, heavier on the malt side, with moments of a cidery overtones and some spice.

Finish: Warm and candied.

Chimay Blue is a god-tier beer. Red is one that is not quite as acclaimed, but if it matches the quality of Blue I will be very impressed. Also, despite my love for Belgian beers, I have not had very many Dubbels, though I thoroughly enjoyed the one’s I’ve had. Let’s see if this legend lives up to the hype

Pours a murky mahogany color with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is beautiful balanced with the dark fruit and subtle spice complementing the chewy malt. I’m picking up on aromas of gold raisin, fig, dark toffee, allspice, brown bread, clove, and a hint of caramel

This focuses on the malt way more heavily in flavor, but works in its advantage. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting raisin, sticky toffee, brown bread, light black cherry, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of sweet black cherry, clove, doughy malt, light vanilla, molasses, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and luxuriously creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a wonderful sweetness

Such a wonderfully crafted beer, absolutely perfect for a warm summer night. I’d get it far more frequently if it wasn’t $8 a bottle"
Popular,Rouge (Red),4.55,"I like the red Chimay as it gives the taste of a Tripel with a lighter ABV of 7%. Complex beer with many of the fig/banana/ sweet candy flavours of others, without a lasting hangover. This bottle was a little light on the effervescent side, and the head was gone in a flash, with not much for carbonation through the ending dregs.
I am preparing myself for our annual holiday, Canada Day, when I will only drink the colours of the flag, Red and White.
Next up, Chimay White!"

Well, after having KBBS, the highest rated beer in the world and a heavily adjuncted Stout for review 1000, I figure a classic, no frills Stout is the logical next step. I’ve never had this one fresh, but I’m excited to try it regardless, especially for the Cellaruary thread. Let’s get into it

Pours a muddy dark brown with a finger of tan head that immediately fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

It is pretty wild the complexity a Stout can have without barrel aging; everything speaks for itself without any distraction. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark toast, toffee, earthy bourbon, light roast coffee, and charred oak

I know the age and abv definitely play a role in bumping up the complexity and robustness of this beer, but it's an impressive thing regardless. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, black cherry, caramel, charred malt, dark bready malt, bourbon, light raisin, and a touch of red wine. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, rich red wine, charred malt, toffee, black cherry, and a touch of acidic coffee

A full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a somewhat hot beer. Finishes off dry with a lightly tart fruitiness

This is solid stuff right here. I really can't believe I waited this long to try it. A far cry from the KBBS I had yesterday for review 1000, but a wonderful beer in its own right. Hopefully I can get a fresher bottle next time"
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.19,"This is the highest abv beer I've ever actually enjoyed. Drank way too much of it when it was on tap locally! Somehow, impressively keeps the booziness minimal while bringing all the right stout characteristics forward. Impressive."
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.18,"2016 bottle, cracked open in 2022.

A - Pours opaque, black with brown highlights. Minimal light tan head. Fades to a pencil thin line around the glass, no lacing.

S - A big nose of alcohol warmth, boozy and bourbon-like, vanilla and malts, roasted up nice.

T - Follows the nose, with a fat malty open, chocolate and dark fruits, vanilla and a subtly bitter finish.

M - This is such a big beer, not heavy for it, and more drinkable than I expected. Warm, minimal carbonation.

O - Superb. This is not my favorite type of stout. But incredibly well built. Great example of what can be done."
Popular,World Wide Stout,3.75,"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Black colour. Intense aroma of sweet malts, roasted barley, leather, liquorice and oak. Very sweet, alcoholic and roasty flavour with notes of molasses. Interesting, but overdone."
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.52,"This beer has always been good, quite good. A couple times great. What I've found is that it varies quite a bit with batch and age. The bones are consistent, but the body and the smooth are the characteristics that are the most different. Expensive and not always easy to get."
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.5,"Bottle 4/23/19. I would have aged this longer but I was really curious to try it since I am sampling several stouts this winter. Very dark in appearance, as one would expect. Very strong roasty smell of boozy vanilla. Very intense flavor with some vanilla, hints of chocolate and overall sweetness. I miss some complexity in the flavor in comparison to other stouts I have sampled. There is no doubt it has a boozy presence, is quite smooth and is really enjoyable. I agree with others who said it is a liquor among beers, and that splitting a bottle with someone is really perfect!"
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.49,"Opaque black color, huge alcohol aroma and flavor, sweet flavor, but by no means cloying, long warm finish. The alcohol in this beer overwhelms the tastebuds to the point that the stout character is not detectable. But it's really good!"
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.53,"My 12oz bottle is at least two years old according to the store. (Actually 2016 - so 5 yo )

Pours pitch black with a short lived tan head which ends as lacing.

Smells of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and alcohol. Tastes of chocolate, coffee and raisins. Slightly bitter finish mostly from the coffee. A lot of alcoholic warmth at the end of a sip as well.

Full body with light carbonation. Lush syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a liqueur among beers!"
Popular,World Wide Stout,3.26,"12oz bottle, obcenely expensive, 3 years old

Almost black, cola edge, not much (if any) foam to speak of, smells like coffee beans, hops, and paint varnish. Very bitter and sweet, the coffee is bitter and sweet, the hops are bitter, the malt is honey-like in flavor and feel and sweetness (i.e. pure sugar). If I can describe the taste in cave-man terms - ""chocolate sweet, malty, then bitter coffee alcohol burn"".

This is a big, thick, chewy beer, and it hides the 18% astonishingly well, actually able to fold the ""woody"" alcohol flavor back into the rest of the attack on your taste buds: coffee, chocolate, honey, and all the sweet malt duking it out on the sweet/bitter battlewargrounds, making a mess all over your tastebuds"
Popular,World Wide Stout,4.07,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The date on the bottle reads 09/22/16 - 4.5 years old.

A: The beer is pure black with a brown head that surprisingly built up to about 1.5 foamy fingers and stuck around a bit. No light coming through at all, even directly to light. A serious looking beer.

S: A lot going on here, but much of it is kind of buried beneath a strong, hot boozy aroma. Bourbon and port mostly. Dark fruits like plum and raisin, medicinal cherry. A hint of vanilla, roasted malt. This is a complex aroma, but a bit heavy on the alcohol.

T: Vanilla, roasted character. Dark fruit in the mid-palate. Finishes very heavy on the port alcohol character. Hard to unpack a lot of the flavors in here due to the heavy alcohol content.

F: A bit oily and coating, but burns a bit going down and when held in the mouth.

Overall: There is a lot of good in here, but it is buried under a ton of alcohol. On an experimental level, that's kind of the point, and I'd like to revisit this after a few more years to see how that continues to mellow out. This was a good experience, a lot to unpack, but really a one off for me unless I can find a really old one, and cheaply."
Popular,Devil Dancer,3.96,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!"
Popular,Devil Dancer,4,"Amber hues and sticky sweet. Booze and pine. Caramel malts. Noticeable lack of citrus on the nose and in the taste. Musty hops and dark fig fruit. Bubbly to the finish. Outrageous bitterness becomes more pronounced as it warms, rounding out the flavor profile and improving the taste. Overall quite nice. And at 12% ABV, it will do the trick."
Popular,Devil Dancer,4.05,"Appearance:
Pours the color dark wildflower honey, a deep amber with sunny hues of orange.

Bouquet:
Syrupy sweet hops, mango, citrus, and pleasing, earthy yeast after-notes.

Taste:
Ye gods, hops! A spectacular symphony of hops: musty herbals, bright florals, and sharp citruses. All riding in on a lush wave of lavish treats, like butterscotch, caramel, and raspberries. Finishes with a clean, powerful heat.

Feel:
Full-bodied. Satiny molasses with a bubbly bite. The treacle-like qualities don't overstay their welcome, but the bright, effervescence lingers like a miniature fireworks display, as its tickling bubbles burst brilliantly in all corners of the mouth. The contrast is delightful.

Popular,Devil Dancer,4.22,"Boy this one’s good. Whew. Powerful and strong yet flavorful and clean. So-called “triple” IPA obtained fresh from Founders via growler. Purchased on 9/6/19. Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery."
Popular,Devil Dancer,3.92,"Look: Oooooh. Almost brown-orange. Easily the prettiest of the four IPAs I ordered as a flight at the Founders brewery. Persistent lacing and continuous bubbles.

Smell: It smells wet, the way that yeasty Belgians can, but in a way that I know it's not actually going to taste like that. It's weird; honestly it smells a little ""off"", but the taste is fine.

Taste: Astringently hoppy (which I like),

Feel: tingly, foamy. Thick and resinous but so effervescent, so quite a contradiction in mouthfeel

Overall: compared against Founder's 12 Feet Under, I'd say I prefer 12 Feet Under. Maybe it's just because I have a fond place in my heart for things like Dogfish 120, or because barrell-aing anything is a great way to my heart. This is fine, and very hop forward, but doesn't have the depth of 12 Feet Under. Dogfish 120...12 Feet Under...120 Feet Under? I smell a collaboration in the future. Get on it, Founders!"
Popular,Devil Dancer,4.84,"Bottle from the cellar. Bought in 2012. With a cabinet full of barley wines and belgian darks, this is a real standout. Low carb, low to no head. Deep copper/red color.

Thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Caramel, raspberry & strawberry flavors up front; a brutally bitter, dry alcohol heat finish.

Good flavors lurk beneath a punishing finish. Too bad."

This bottle was pushed to the back of the collection and just unearthed.
Pours a clear reddish amber with a billowy head that slowly fades. Lots of malt and caramel on the nose. Very flavorful, lots of caramel, malt, butterscotch, ends with a clean bitterness. Boozy, 12% abv is obvious. Thick and syrupy, carbonation is still great after 2.5 years!

Popular,Resin,4.14,"This is a thin but tall 12oz. can poured into the Six Point pint glass. This ale is somewhat hazy, has an orange glow, with medium carbonation, the head is white, one finger, that quickly surrendered to a thin solid cap.
The aroma is noticeable from a distance, a pleasant sweet citrus!, I am surprised that I can pick up a light bread malt under the citrus
The flavor is sweet orange citrus giving way to some pine hops that I am certain will bring you to pucker for a second. The bitterness does not overpower the sweetness for long allowing one to enjoy the ale.
This brew has a 9.1 ABV, but the alcohol is hidden perfectly behind the flavor, there is not an alcohol bite or any noticeable heat.
Resin is a pleasant surprise! I was certain it would be overly bitter with an alcohol burn. The bitterness is very much present, but does not destroy the great flavor of this DIPA!!"

Popular,Resin,4.45,Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold orange with a big thick rocky persistent head. Great smell- resinous and almost a sharp bright piney character. Some citrus too. Sort of a rounded bitterness up front which persists throughout and lingers through the finish. Resinous and piney in the middle. A little bit of a caramel malt mixes in. Full bodied. Very good double IPA.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Here we have another beer that I'm sure I've reviewed before but somehow went missing. It's poured a hazy amber colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The aroma is resinous - duh! - piney, delicately citrusy, and lightly floral. On to the taste... very much the same. The malt is grainy and lightly biscuity. The hops are floral, a touch grassy, and fruity with apple, orange, lemon, and grapefruit. There's probably more there as well! It's got a solid bitterness at a listed 103 IBUs but it doesn't come off nearly as bitter given the amount of malt that's there. It's a very nice blend between sweetish and biscuity malt and a variety of hop notes. The alcohol is apparent but not overly clear, and in combination with the bitterness and a little bit of acidic ""hop bite"" it finishes mainly dry with some grassy, resinous, and floral hops lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp. All in all this is a solid kind of old school double IPA that shouldn't be ignored. There are bigger, brighter, and brasher IPAs out there but this is a feel good, fall back version. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that this bitch clocks in at a whopping 9.1% ABV so you should probably slate it for later in the night.

Popular,Resin,4.26,"Packaging-5/5- I'm going to talk about the packaging here for a second. This beer comes in a distinct thin bullet can with a powdery green tint and golden/rusty orange embroidered sign on the front. The design is great and it really does make this beer stand out from the others. It has a distinct classic and weathered look that's oddly memorable and visually represents what this beer is, or is trying to, perceive. Looks great.

L-Pours a lively one finger headed ale with a finger and a half head and a golden amber-ish color. Subtle bubbles are there as well.
S-Smells like a very well crafted standard imperial IPA. Malty front with some hints of butterscotch and molasses. Piney, and earthy hop resin is there. Also, in some way, I almost get a candy-like Sweet Tart aroma. Smells great.
T-Not bad on the flavor. Malty sweet upfront with a bitter bite at the end. Subdued enough to invite other flavors as well. There is definitely some mandarine orange here, with a hint of grapefruit.
F-A medium bodied, juicy mouthfeel with a dry and refreshing finish.
O-Quite the experience. From the can to the finish I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It's hard to come by an imperial IPA that is made so well and is so drinkable. Glad I got to try this!"
Popular,Resin,4.31,"Such a pretty, orange/rusty colour in the glass with a bright, white, persistent head.

This can is reasonably old so aroma is restrained. There's some caramel and pine and a little bit of orange peel.

The flavour though... Oh my, the flavour. This beer is proudly IPA, even with age on the can. There's piney, resinous notes, some diesel and dankness that has taken over from where I would have expected fruitbowl citrus in a younger beer, but it still tastes fantastic. It's no longer able to hide its alcohol but it's only adding to the pleasure of the newly evolved whole that this beer has become.

Can't wait to taste it fresh!

Cheers"
Popular,Resin,3.97,"Looks fantastic for the style. Pours a beautiful, cloudy golden hue with a nice two finger white head which dissipates to leave a sticky white lace as it recedes. Smells fruity and hoppy. Slight citrus, pine, hops, and something l can't quite put my nose on, floral, but it's pleasant. I like it. Taste is slightly citrusy, floral, piny, hoppy. Great flavors that come togethet nicely, but a bit overcomplicated for my taste. Really love the unknown floral type flavor though. So faint, but it's there. Feel is great from start to finish. Medium carbonation turns slightly creamy towards the end. Overall, a fine brew that hides the 9.1% abv well. 10.99 for a sixer. Not terrible at all. Glad l grabbed em."
Popular,Resin,4.28,"slim can, best by Nov 14, 2021 (oops), into THAT! NE IPA snifter.

Juicy medium orange with a finger of head, no lacing as it recedes.

Aroma of pine, citrus, juicy yeast, spruce, and slight onion.

For being a month out of date, this is still tasting fantastic. Wonderful alcohol citrus notes all over the place, with some more tropical notes following. White grapefruit, mandarin orange, lychee, pineapple, peach, and mango all dance around some oily pine and circus peanut. I'm very impressed.

Feel is carbonated, juicy, slightly resinous but less than you'd think when considering the name, with well hidden alcohol.

Overall, really surprised I'm jamming this one. I thought it'd be a drain pour but there's still some life left and I really like what's here. This is probably my favorite Sixpoint IPA now. Gonna pick up a 6 pack when I encounter it again. Incredible stuff, very impressive. This is the Sixpoint of old times. Damn cheap too.

Popular,Resin,4.19,"From a slim, tall 12 oz. can into a Perfect Pint glass. Translucent orange color with thick creamy white foam head. Nose of piney hops. I guess resin refers to pine resin, and there’s a bit of that but it’s not a major component. Taste is typical of a good double IPA, lots of hop up front tempered by malt but not too sweet. Also, it’s not a hop bomb. What do we have here then? Perhaps a “well balanced DIPA.” Mouth is slightly viscous/creamy and crisply bubbly.

Overall: I really like this. It’s similar to my favorite DIPA, Dogfish Head’s 90 Minute IPA, but less sweet and possibly more enjoyable. I’ll have to do a head to head comparison sometime. Highly recommended."

Popular,Resin,4.27,"Best by Oct 1 -21 it says on the can bottom.
Golden amber and opaque but not hazy in the light, deeper amber in the shade. A tall sticky white head forms and slumps quickly to a dense ring with drapes of lace.
Smells of wildflowers and conifers supported by a doughy sweetness with hints of ginger and lemon zest.
The flavor is almost weak up front for such a big beer - no flood of tongue heavy sugar that warns of the heft.
Balance is the word - malt and hop bitterness blend well and while I know the 9% is there, the malt depth is as solid as the hop character. Rich, medium bodied caramel is spiced with grassy, piney hop acids and a nutty toasted grain thing goin on making this a tasty swallow-er not a sipper.
The finish is on the dry side with a hint of fruit.
I never like the marketing of beer with terms like ""dank"" and resin since there is nothing reminiscent of cannabis in this beer despite the remote family connection to the hop plant.

On the pour a nearly 2 finger lightly fizzy head formed and left some surprisingly decent lacing. Body is a darker golden straw carbonation is high but fine.

Aroma is malty, adjuncty, and has a bit of that cheap lager funk to it. I want to say I can detect hops similar to a pilsner but it's definitely leaning more toward cheap AAL. Not great, but for the style it's pretty good.

Taste is similar to MHL. A bit too sweet but relatively clean and light apart from the adjunct. Not a lot of bitterness but there is a very light hint. Not offensive not great but way better than coors light. This is light enough that I can taste carbonic acid like in a seltzer.

Feel is carbonated, relatively dry and easy drinking. A bit bigger than your average light beer, and with a longer finish. Completely average and it does its job.

Overall for a BMC light beer this is pretty good. Certainly not mind blowing but I'd get this again. Miller always seems to do better Than Bud and coors (even tho Miller is owned by coors in the US now but whatever)"

Idk all the ingredient that are put in here BC Miller does not list them, but something tastes funky. You can taste the artificial syrup taste you get from cheap beer.

Mouthfeel: None to speak of, just like water.

Popular,Midas Touch,3.98,"Figured it was time to give this beer a whirl.
This bottle is ancient indeed...6/28/19, so a little over a year old at this point. Poured into an Ommegang snifter.

Pours a surprisingly gold color (I expected burnt orange like a barleywine) with a fluffy creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a mossy ring with lace built up on the sides.

Aroma is pleasantly fruity and bright with elements of grape and citrus, slight pineapple, slight melon. Everything is brighter than expected. I guess I should shift my focus.

Flavor is a bit wasted at this point with some oxidized hops in tow somewhere; trying to re-align, I spot some more vinous but still white grape-ish notes, some oak barrel, a little bit of muscat, some melon rind, white grapefruit, honey, chive, and a bit of cilantro or other fresh herb.

Feel is crisp and starchy, but has a nice sticky yet oaky barrel barrel presence. Alcohol presence is rather high but to be expected, though feels more along the lines of a 12%'er. Drying finish with that microfiber sponge feel.

Overall this beer isn't bad, and I should try to find it fresher to get a better picture of it. Dogfish Head continues to be the curator of off-centered shit and this is definitely one of those examples. I like it though, it's twisted and won't fit into any of your neat little polite food tray-sized niches.

Price paid : $3.69 / bottle
Would buy again : Probably, to try it fresher."

Ancient ales, huh? My first one of the series, I didn't even realize they were doing a batch this year

Pours a lightly cloudy orange/gold with just a white cap that fizzles away to a ring of bubbles very fast and leaves no lacing

Quite the odd aroma here, I'm picking up a lot of different notes. There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent

Oh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well

Pretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry

A perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations. Others however, might say that this is hardly beer and is not good. Regardless of how weird this is, I like it quite a bit. DFH always keeps it weird"
Popular,Midas Touch,4.86,"Appearance:
Pours a diaphanous shade of burnished gold blended with vibrant, daffodil yellow. Forms a dense, white froth, similar to the creamed bubbles that crown an authentic cappuccino. Leaves a geometrically perfect circle of sudsy white lacing that thins out the further it reaches, but endures unbroken all the way to the end.

Bouquet:
Bushels of honeysuckle flowers, trailed by a delicate mist of Moscato, puffed cereal grains, freshly sliced Honeycrisp apple, and a trace of orange rind that gently ushers the aroma away from being too sugary.

Feel:
A medium body that's granted manly heft by a foamy, nimbus texture I've never experienced before. Imagine if cotton candy were ghost and that'd put you near the mark of this ale's magical mouthfeel. A caress of sinful silk with a dry, Riesling finish.

Taste:
Honeycomb slathered in sweet, golden nectar. The honey aspect is earthy and intensely real. Not store-bought honey, not honey flavoring, more like: caveman who owns his own beehive, honey. This primal delight is followed by juicy white grapes, a liberal layer of powdery saffron, and a far-off melody of malts melded with tart fruit."
Popular,Midas Touch,3.67,"Nice fine head about a finger thick, lots of small carbonation bubbles. Clear gold in color. Smells like white wine/ champagne. It's hard to pin down the flavor, pretty unique. Like a mild bitter ale with hint of white grapes but nothing stands out which is good in it's own way. Finishes pretty dry. Overall, it's decent. Worth trying but not particularly my kind of brew."
Popular,Midas Touch,4.14,"Bottled on 6/28/2019, revisiting this classic after who knows how many years.

Look: The beer is translucent with a slight haze. Straw - pale gold. Some visible carbonation. A bone white head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, with some larger bubbles here and there. Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.

Smell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way.

Taste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit.

Feel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out.

Overall: The nose on this beer is great. The flavor profile is a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests, and I’d love more of the grape profile in the flavor. That being said, this beer is very drinkable for 9%, and overall very enjoyable. Happy to have revisited."

Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, thick and rindy with hearty notes of grapes and honey making for a sweet and off-center brew.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Popular,Midas Touch,3.37,"Bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear, medium golden body with a small cap of foamy head. Grainy aroma, malty, reminiscent of some of the emmer or spelt beets in Germany. Taste starts out malty before turning over to some savory, herbal flavors, woody, juniper. I guess the ancient Sumerians had it pretty good..."
Popular,Midas Touch,4.16,"Bottled 06/28/19. A light orange color with an odd look due to the tiny specks of suspension. The light carbonation is a nice addition though. No head. The aroma is nice. It does smell sweet like wine. Taste follows the nose and I get some sweetness that would make me think of soda pop almost. The flavors on the tongue are like an orange drink. It tastes good but it doesn't seem beer like at all. The mouthfeel is very nice. I think you pour this into a cup and tell someone it's soda pop and they wouldn't know the difference. That 9% ABV would be a BIG surprise though. Overall an interesting experience that a beer nerd would appreciate from the truly great craft brewer Dogfish Head, Milton, Delaware."
Popular,ApriHop,4.71,"One of my favorite beers ever, the dark, almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the IPA style that you might think. A perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it."
Popular,ApriHop,4.16,"The appearance was always a nice amber to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace to a semi-filmy lacing. The aroma, woah, absolutely freakin’ awesomely apricot to peachy goodness filling a super nice semi-bitter piney hoppiness running about the nose. The taste was mostly bitter but lead to a nice semi-sweet citrus-ness concerning itself to try to run itself about a nice aftertaste and ended up leading to a fairly same finish. On the palate, this one shows a nice sessionable quality running about it and still lends a hand to a nice carbonation running about its body and shows that there is nothing overbearing of the sorts on any end. Overall, good fruit beer that shows a decent bitter hoppiness trying to make it come across as an AIPA."

Popular,Julius,4.6,Had this years ago and forgot to rate it. Fortunately a buddy made a run and grabbed 4 of these classics. If treehouse had never developed anything better this would still be a gold standard of the style. Delicious in every way.
Popular,Julius,4.53,"On draft at the brewery. Gorgeous in a tulip glass. Good mouth feel, I could definitely crush more than one of these. Tastes of citrus but not overwhelmingly so.

An excellent NEIPA but I could easily name half-a-dozen from around New England that I like at least as much. Clearly more sampling is necessary."
Popular,Julius,4.66,"Canned 7/21/22

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.

The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.

The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.

I sipped on King Julius for more than an hour, but I feel like I would crush the regular version all day. Great beer."
Popular,Julius,4.09,"Why is Tree House so hyped? Broad selection? OK, I get that. Rate the brewery high, but not their beers. The IPAs balanced but boring compared to a lot of others that are out there, their flagships like this one included. And I find this one a little too fizzy. I like the taste more than the feel. I'll happily drink it but wouldn't go out of my way for it (which is kind of what you have to do for Tree House)."

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.

Popular,Julius,4.48,"Hazy body, orange and peach toned; huge head, rocky and white; sticky globs of foam cling to the glass. Outstanding citrus smell; orange and tangerine; oats and other cereal grains. Complex and varied flavors; toasted grain; oats; bread crust; citrus pith; bold bitterness with a touch of phenol expression; moderate alcohol note. Heavy body; velvety; alcohol warmth and dryness

I've been curious about this popular and highly rated beer, and I'm glad my curiosity has been satisfied. It certainly earns its reputation for greatness.

I’ve had this one sitting around for a while but it seems like every time I open the fridge I’m not really in the mood for something like this. Except tonight. I need some (Americanized) Belgian in my life

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly reduces to a cap and leaves no lacing

The nose is pretty lively here. The Belgian yeast lends notes of banana, pepper, and light bubblegum. There’s minor notes of lemon and honey to support the yeast

Hmmm, this is more tart than I expected on the front end. Right off the bat I get tart lemon and mild pepper. Post swallow brings more of the same, but layers in sweet malt, light hops, and orange. Quite tasty actually

This has a medium body and very light carbonation, leading to a smooth and refreshing drink. It finishes a bit too sticky for my taste, but it works out in a beer like this

Popular,Matilda,3.97,"Okay - I don't write connoisseur reviews. That said -- I like this beer because it isn't over the top hoppy, but still has that bite. I haven't seen many people describe it as a farmhouse ale, but that's how I would best describe it. The ABV seems a little stronger than 7%, but I'm not on my ass after a few. Not your ""after yard work"" beer; it's not what I would call ""refreshing"" -- more after you have showered and are getting ready for dinner. All things said, I would probably opt for Sofie, but Matilda is right after. My only disappointment -- they changed the label. The label below was classic!"
Popular,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.67,"This is a solid weissbier. Pours a hazy amber with a good, foamy head. Taste is of wheat and yeast. Overall, a fine weissbier.

Popular,Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.03,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: 07.01.2022 (L007136)
Glass: 0.5L Hefeweizen Vase
Temp at Pour: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Opaque orange-tinged gold. I can see shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass, but that's it. Initial 2-3-finger white head soon collapses to a thin (0.25"") but consistent cover. Decent lacing.

Smell:
Bananas, citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, and notes of apricot/peach. White bread dough. A faint hint of cloves. There is that ""twang"" that I detect in most Weissbiers (and also more general wheat beers).

Taste:
Everything from the nose is present here, with a greater emphasis on the bananas, especially the overripe kind. Sweet oranges shine through the citrus. The cloves are also more pronounced and are joined by some cinnamon, but they only serve to balances the greater sweetness that the taste possesses. There is a hint of bubblegum towards the end, but the finish is restrained cloves and soft sweetness.

Feel:
Smooth, creamy, and soft with a medium body that can drift a shade light.

Overall:
A very good Weissbier that is more about the bananas and (citrus) fruits than about the cloves and spices. While not in the same tier as Weihenstephaner, Schneider, Ayinger, or Andechs, it is only one tier removed from those stalwarts. And is typically easier to find. A fine Weissbier for a spring or early summer afternoon.

I do want to mention that I find that the half-liter bottles provide me with a better experience than the one-third liter bottles. I am not sure why. But it is something that I have noticed over the years. YMMV."

Perfectly balanced, high carbonation, great mouth-feel, refreshing but with a delicious banana-toffee like taste.

I should add, i've never seen this beer in a can, only in a flask here in Sweden.

One of the best beers i've tried, period. That is, if you like wheat beer - if you do not, i'd say, avoid it. Otherwise, grab your wheat-beer glass, pour it cold on a sunny friday and just enjoy life."

Bold Belgian smell, aka, bubble gum, banana and bready malt with some funk greets the nose. Hop smell is mild and floral. Alcohol is noticeable yet considering the 9.5% ABV it is well hidden

Big taste of bready and caramel malt, semi-sweet with mild bitterness from alcohol more than hops. The alcohol taste is pervasive yet not astringent. Banana and clove in a Hefeweizen like way arrives late on the palate. The finish is fast, and flavors do not change much at the end. A peppery alcohol bite lingers that is warming and pleasant with bitterness rising to above average.

Medium-light malty body, well carbonated throughout the drink. Again, I must say how well the alcohol is hidden and presented. Balanced and easy to drink, the buzz hits quickly. This one is dangerously drinkable."

Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.51,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass
Appearance – The brew pours a lightly hazed golden amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a biscuit and cracker malt mixed with aromas of white grape and yeast. Along with these smells comes spice of clove and coriander as well as some apricot and peach. With a touch of harvest fruit and a bit of candied sugar an overall very inviting aroma is produced.
Taste – The taste begins with a mix of cracker malt and candied sugar sweetness mixed with flavors of apricot, grape and peach. At the same time there is a nice spice of coriander and clove as well as a decent showing of yeast cake and grain. As the taste advances the grain, spice, and candied sugar tastes fad a tad, all while the fruit, especially the peach, and yeast grown stronger. At the same time some hay and a touch of pear arrive on screen, producing a very pleasant, crisp, and flavorful taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the tastes the feel is spot on, and makes for a very nice crisp sipper.
Overall – A fantastic tripel. Super flavorful and crisp with a very easy drinking and balanced flavor. Defiantly one of the best out there."
Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.57,"330 ml bottle, exp. 09/23, excellent beer. Foam never ends. Dense. Alcohol mixes well with other scents, sweet ones. A hidden citric note fits well on mouth. The excess of foam is beautiful but is a bit of a disturbance to the tasting of it."
Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.72,"The beer is a hazy, translucent, bubbly yellow color, kind of straw but looks more burnt orange when held up to a light. Some yeast sediment is in it. Ample carbonation leaves a huge soapy white head that lingers.

The aroma is slightly sour and mildewy, some orange and lemon juice, big white wine/white grape must come to think of it, hay, toasty biscuit, slight sweetness, and white pepper.

The taste follows the nose pretty closely. The main flavors upfront are of dry white wine complimented by a nice tart citrus, (orange and lemon peel) and subtle barnyard funk, with hay, toasted cracker, and a white pepper floating in the background. The wheat and effervescent carbonation give this a fluffy and extremely pleasant mouthfeel. It closes out on a perfect balance of the sweet-dry spectrum. A hint of sweetness to tantalize the taste buds but dry enough to beg the next sip. This brew is wonderfully made. Holy mackerel. I see why many people consider this to be the quintessential Belgian tripel."
Popular,Trappist Tripel,3.72,"Westmalle Tripel.... it's been a minute since I've had a tripel, and I quite enjoy them, first time with this one.
Poured into a stemless total wine glass. Hazy gold body, huge soapy white head off a gentle pour. Loose, large bubbles, bone white, slowly fall back to a 1/4"" thin head that persists through the life of the beer. Large chunks of sediment despite an attempt to decant.
Nose? Banana, bubble gum, peppercorns, candi sugars, candied lemon peel. A lot going on, complex, no diacetyl or dms, phenols out the wazoo. No hops to speak of. Yeast driven nose, everything else is buried. As it warms there is a slight white wine smell coming through.
Taste, Bananas, bubble gum, alcohol, rock candy. Slight lemon on the aftertaste if I look hard. No hops, no grain, dry. As the beer warms there is a vineous note.
Mouthfeel- thin bodied and dry. Phenols give a suggestion of sweetness as does the alcohol. Effervescent. Each sip bursts into small bubbles as it hits the palate.
Overall. It's a well made beer, the yeast phenols push it into hefe territory for me. I much prefer Karmaleit when it comes to the style. Not sure why I got so much banana from this bottle."
Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.51,"Pours a cloudy bright orange color. Mostly opaque with a moderate amount of suspended sediment.

The aroma on this is lovely - it has notes of malts, white grape, apple, pear, some light banana, and some floral hop notes. Its subtle, refined, yet complex.

The taste follows the nose with notes of rich malts, belgian yeast that leans into the fruity side of things with notes of apple, pear, white grape and just a hint of banana. Along with the fruity notes come some spiced notes - clove, allspice and peppercorn. Moderately spicy, but not overly so. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish with a light floral character.

Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.27,"An absolutely gorgeous glass of beer that lasts to the last sip. Cloudy pale orange white sudsy head, but no lacing.

Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.29,"Pours a cloudy, golden amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smells of caramel malt, floral hops, with hints of citrus, some fruity esters and hints of toffee. Taste is a great balance of caramel malt, fruity and slightly spicy esters, with notes of banana, apricot and clove, as well as lighter floral, bitter hops with hints of orange rind and toffee also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with some banana, orange rind and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This is actually the first time I've had this Tripel and while it is very good indeed, it doesn't quite reach Tripel Karmeliet or Chimay Tripel to me. The banana notes are quite at the forefront here, which I'm not a huge fan of, while the spice is noticeable, but a little subdued. Nevertheless there's a great balance of malts, hops and esters to this, with quite a rich and full body and mouthfeel as well. I was actually surprised by how much hops, relatively speaking, are left in this at just over one year old and would love to try it fresh sometime, which just might edge it a little closer to my aforementioned favorites. Also, considering that this has the highest ABV out of any Tripel I've tried so far, it really doesn't feel overly boozy at all."

Popular,Trappist Tripel,5,One of the Original triples from Belgium I believe this beer got it all amazing golden color milky head perfectly high carbonation and bitter sweet finish it’s a classic and I love it! And you should too!!
Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.4,"Pours a hazy golden colour with a strong orange tint, a pillowy three inch head appears and slowly collapses into a thick, lacing creamy line of white.

On first smell, there is a deep, savoury aroma unlike anything I’ve smelled before. Will have to come back to this (many times!) to develop my palate a bit more. Suffice it to say, it’s very enticing. Delicious aromas of yeasty breads, wheat, and spices waft around. Banana’s and specifically green apples make up a strong fruity backbone — less citrus and juicy, more of that smoother textured fruits, the aforementioned creamy bananas, silty earthy apples. Again, that tasty savoury aroma appears almost heavy in my nose. Maybe I know what people mean when they say ‘doughy yeast’ now

Taste does follow the nose, and is remarkably complex in many ways. Spicy fruits up front here for me, apples cloves and nutmeg, a little sweet with maybe only the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Savoury in the middle with tasty grains and malty notes, candi sugar, and banana. There is a very long finish that rests on a gentle bitter-sweetness, remaining with a doughy taste on your tongue.

Medium bodied, this is well carbonated but not carbonated too strong as to overpower the flavours. Coalesces into a creamy sip on the way down, finishes dry and bittersweet leaning on the sweet side.

I love overpowering malty Tripels, which is not what you get with Westmalle. Instead, you get one that is a little gentler, but melds an enormous amount of wonderful aromas and flavours into a perfectly blended and smooth beer. No note stands out too much, each has its place and they wax and wane in and out together to create a remarkable experience. Absolutely wonderful beer"

Popular,Trappist Tripel,4.48,"A marvelous beer. Pours with a complete white head. It has a very malty scent. The flavor is very strong and this one sneaks up on you. Loved it. Not perfect, but I don’t know what would be better."
Popular,Maudite,3.69,"Pours an opaque deep tan, soft 1.5"" head that thing out to a solid quarter inch, a bit on the light side; nice, streaking lacing. Nose is brown sugar, clove, allspice, banana, and some earthy hop notes as well; light roast as well as it warms. Taste leads candy, sugary sweet with only light baking spice notes to rein things in. Sweetness dissipates quickly, however, as warming notes from the alcohol become more prominent. As the beer warms, light spice and banana come through, but the dominant flavor is brown sugar, and the beer is lacking in depth. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth with mild but bright carbonation."

Popular,Maudite,4.23,"pours a hazy toffee brown body with a tanned cream froth head that has moderately high retention and leaves sheets of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a murky, full cap with thick defined halo

taste follows the nose and kicks it up to 11.

mouthfeel is medium carbonation and medium bodied. it runs smooth with a bit of grainy, prickly, chewiness

super solid brew with a slightly nuanced complexity. to boot, it comes with a certain legacy that ought to be honored, one that shines through with the overall enjoyability of this slightly high abv malt bomb"
Popular,Maudite,4.21,"#2 dubbed as ranked on beer advocate

Bottle poured into a large nonic

Brewers Notes: Without a doubt Unibroue’s best-known beer, La Maudite is inspired by abbey beers and Belgian double-style ales. It first hit the shelves in 1992 and took the province by storm with its 8% alcohol content, making it the first strong beer available in grocery stores.

That’s where the idea came to tie its name and branding to a pact signed with the devil. The illustration of the “chasse-galerie” (or flying canoe) from a belove

Popular,Maudite,4.02,"A near opaque matte, dull rust/copper body with an aggressive but not violent red clay tinged head. Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors."

Like the nose, the flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread and dark fruits. Lightly spicy with some caramel and toffee that rounds it out. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a smooth finish

Overall, Maudite is a nice beer with a lot going for it. Very nice"
Popular,Maudite,4.06,"This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review.

It pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.

The smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.

The taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.

Mildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.

Overall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant."
Popular,Maudite,4.24,"Pours a cloudy, deep ochre colour in a tall goblet. Generous 4-5 inch head slowly condenses into a thick two inch head supported by the carbonation over the next 15 minutes.

Smells are lovely and complex. Overall spicy smells up front followed by gentle malts. Lots of bread, spices, peppery stuff here.

What a lovely taste. There are three parts on most of my sips. The up front — strong and peppery, coriander and Black pepper. Followed by the middle, which comes quickly after the spicy sip — malts and hop character swirl around, sweet bread and yeast followed by some grassy, clove-like bitterness. It ultimately finishes with the strong malt, yeast backbone, and the coriander and orange citrus notes can absolutely be noticed here.

As the beer warmed and I continued to sip I noticed a tiny bit of candied plum flavours in the finish, which again, was strongly malt forward and relatively sweet.

Beer is medium-ish bodied, smooth, nice carbonation, the alcohol doesn’t present a strong bite here anywhere. Finishes sweet but mostly dry.

This is overall quite a gorgeous beer. The one time I’m happy to be in Canada when it comes to beer is being so close to Unibroue. We can’t import international beers, and our offerings are tightly controlled by the government liquor boards, but we always always always can get the first pickings of Unibroue’s beers. Their winter collection is awesome. Maudite is an excellent beer and it has been 10 years ago when I first tried it, and is excellent to this very day."

a amber tinged brown with a nice head of white foam that settles to a
thick ring, thin dusty layer, and shows off some nice light lacing. Nose of

hops, dates, fig, candy sugar, and coriander. Nice mouth feel;

spicy finish.

Of note, with warmth some white pepper comes into play.

Popular,Maudite,4.25,"Smells fruity and dark with malts sweetening the scent further.

The taste is balanced. It's mostly clean malts with funky Belgian yeast in the background.

The mouthfeel is fantastic. It's medium bodied with a lot of bubbly carbonation to feel like silk. The finish starts bitter and then gets fruity.

Popular,Maudite,4.23,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. I picked this up at a local beer store recently to keep checking off Beers of Fame!
The beer pours a fairly clear amber to mahogany color with a fluffy beige colored head of about 3 cm. This foam fades slowly leaving some sticky lattice on my glass.
The aroma has some light caramel malt and a bit of cloves and light cinnamon. No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style.
The first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer.
Flavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow.
This is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness."
Popular,Maudite,4.55,Another home run. It’s amazing how balanced and well crafted this beer is. It’s even better than actual Belgian dubbels I’ve had. Just please don’t tell the monks
Popular,Curmudgeon,4.12,"A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout."
Popular,Curmudgeon,3.83,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again."
Popular,Curmudgeon,4.5,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent."
Popular,Curmudgeon,4.04,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates, served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: It develops a thin, half finger head that disappears almost immediately and leaves behind a layer of big bubbles that stay until the end. It's a murky, light brown color.

Smell: It's a sweet smell of plums, raisins, molasses and malt with a hint of alcohol in the background.

Taste: It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. There's dried fruit, molasses and brown sugar. It finishes with an earthy, oak note and some alcohol.

Mouthfeel: It's smooth, slightly oily and strong but not heavy at all with a medium body and low carbonation.

Overall: Even though it goes heavily towards the sweeter side, it's not cloying and the sweetness is not one dimensional. There's a lot of different elements to unpack and discover which makes this a really good beer."

It's nice and refreshing, and would honestly pair well with any sort of summer fare. It's an incredibly drinkable wheat ale, with plenty of inoffensive qualities. It's just that nothing really stands out, except for the beautiful three-finger head that lingers to the completion of the brew.

I am a guy who drinks straight out of the bottle and I will say this is one nice-looking bottle compared to your other generic wheat beers. This beer has a very wheaty smell and to me smells just like a ""beefed-up"" version of a typical American lager such as Miller or Coors. That smell goes right into the taste because this is a very wheaty/grainy tasting beer. While it is filling, this is a smooth beer that would go great with a day on the lake.

Looks like a movie beer, very slight cloudiness with a nice cap of foam that sticks around. At least it isn't riding the hazy train, I'm going off the rails with these hazy grain (IPAs). Smells like earth, pine and caramel malts. Drinks a little slick and feels higher than the 8.2% listed, but a well-balanced IPA nonetheless; read: malt forward to most. Grapefruit rind, fresh grass, fresh grass that costs $20 a gram (also known as WEED, DOOD), and also a pine tart finish

It's good but nothing worth seeking out. As far as hops, the bill here could pass as a pale ale or even a lager... I imagine they are cutting costs and hoping no one notices. Maybe some will like a pale ale that happens to be 8.2% - I think it's kinda lame"

Abrasive Ale
Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing."
Popular,Abrasive Ale,4.19,"Pours a light chill haze pale yellow, nice white head laces very well.

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.

Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.

Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.

Popular,Abrasive Ale,4.53,"This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace.

Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.

Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor.

Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.

a: Translucent orange with an inch thick white head which receded to thick surface foam and dense lacing.

s: Dank tropical fruit.

t: Follows the nose with a moderate hop bite and dry finish.

m: Denser side of medium, very good body and some carbonation tingle.

o: A near the top of the top 250 brew years ago, now available in my state. Great flavor presaging the coming of the NE style. Not as fruity but with more tropical danky goodness than most of the best of the old West Coast style entries."
Popular,Abrasive Ale,4.25,"Bier #2 today, a fine, late winter day in New England.... From a 16oz can, bought somewhere recently for a bit o' coin...

It pours a rich, bright, medium golden color. Has a slight smidge of haze, but it's mostly clear. Carbo is steady, though the head is a thin layer of fine white foam, with light lacing. Has a nice aroma, with tangerine, pineapple and pithy grapefruit all present and accounted for. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it passes smoothly over the tongue.

Taste is more on the sweeter side vs. bitter.... Has peach, tangerine, pineapple, a hint of honey, a smidges of guava and passion-fruit. Has some subtle bitterness in the finish, though it is predominantly semisweet. Solid and tasty! Prosit!

Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.37,"500mL bottle stamped 22.018 131021 poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 8.2% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and partial layer of bubbles. The aroma is mild with clove, toffee and sweet wheat malt. The taste is semisweet, clovey, pear and apple laced dark wheat malt. Minimal bitterness. Slight alcohol presence on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, very good weizenbock. Not my favoritist style, but I can appreciate this one."
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.68,"Mixed smell of plums, prunes, rum soaked fruit. Some malty notes including a fairly prominent spiced banana bread. Very pleasant creamy and full bodied feel. Would definitely drink again."
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.77,The flavor delightfully remained on my palate after the mild flowing over my rounds of this delicious doppelbock. It developed a nice flavorful head when I poured it in to a glass. The feel was not heavy like some doppelbock s can be. I truly loved this beer.
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.25,"On tap at Wurstkuche in Downtown Los A feels, CA.

Like visiting your local fishing hole and snagging a trout on your first cast, this one is legit. And the glass is cute like Ariana Grande with cat ears (before she got extra freaky). Either way, Aventinus is an Ace, Home Run, or a Slam dunk, what have you.

Get it on and get it good, my children."
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.62,"L: dark amber, nothing too distinctive, but it's certainly appealing in a glass
S: rum, malt, and bananas
T: bananas, rum, raisins, malt, toffee

O: it's really good, it's available in affordable cans, just grab one and enjoy one of the best bocks readily available."
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,5,"0.5 L bottle
Glass: .5L Weizenbock Vase
Bottle Date: 19.308 => 161019 => 16-Oct-2019
Serving Temp: 51.6 F


Look:
Cloudy and murky medium brown that is opaque from the yeast. I can't see my fingers at all through the glass, not even at the narrow point. 3-finger creamy beige head dissipates slowly to a 1-finger creamy cover. Great lacing
(This last bottle saw the ale starting to foam out of the bottle a few seconds after I opened it).

Smell:
Absolutely wonderful. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried fruits such as raisins and currants. Rich brown sugar. Overripe bananas. Bread dough.

Taste:
As good as it smells, if not better. Cloves bite at the front, but not all that hard. Rich toffee and toasted caramel joion in quickly, along with plums, those rum-soaked dried fruits and the overripe banana. There are notes of whole wheat bread and even banana bread. Some pepper and maybe a dash of cinnamon. Finishes with a lingering combination of rich dark fruits and cloves which somehow comes across as ever-so-slightly dry and spicy.

Feel:
Rich and creamy with a body that is on the heavier side of medium.

Overall:
What a joy to drink. A phenomenal beer. This earns it's World Class reputation. Although one can smell and taste rum-soaked fruit, the alcohol is actually quite well hidden. Very easy to drink. Dangerously so. Goes down smooth as silk but will hit you like a sledgehammer if you aren't careful. Great stuff. This is one of my favorite beers, and has been for well over a decade, if not 2. Absolutely worth trying.

Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.36,"Poured into a tulip, a large three finger head manifests. Tiny bubbles at the bottom, thick ones at the top, it slowly coalesces into a permanent, two finger thick dense, rocky, creamy foamy head that lasts the entire time. A slightly hazy, deep red-brown colour, this looks absolutely phenomenal in the glass. An absolute triumph. It collapses into one of the densest foam heads I’ve ever seen on any beer — not sure what some of the other reviews below are about, but maybe their cans weren’t as fresh as mine.

Very strong aromas of wheat and malt make up the base of the smell, slightly toasty. A little bit of boozy rum, and dried fruits like crispy sugared banana rings or raisins. Some spices and cloves of course!

Taste follows the nose but there are some new flavours here, such as banana bread, some nutty flavours like almond, and maybe even a little bit of orange? Spicy cloves, toasty wheats, chewy malts, the works! Fig, raisin, rum flavours as well. Complex, and even a bit subtle at times. Except for those wheaty, malty, banana spice flavours, those are always up front.

Smooth delicious mouthfeel, good carbonation that prickles your tongue without being too excessive as to wash away the flavours. Medium bodied I’d say, and it coalesces into a creamy gulp at the end of each sip. A nice long finish that is mildly sweet and keeps the general malts and candied fruits and banana on the tongue.

My oh my, what can you really say about this except for how good it is? I had to eisbock first and wanted to see how it compared. The Eisbock definitely concentrates some of the flavour, especially the malt and the darker flavours such as raisin and figs. So what is the difference? Other than the lower abv% here, the weizenbock keeps more of its dried and candied fruit flavours, and the orange/citrus fruit peel flavours as well. This one definitely has more banana in there as well. Both are champions of their respective styles, and in my opinion, the absolute top tier benchmark.

The Aventinus line is bold, beautiful, complex, and easy drinking. Absolutely phenomenal stuff. I’m overjoyed I grabbed the last 6 Eisbocks in all of Canada from the LCBO and always keep my fridge stocked with a couple of the regular Aventinus as well. 100% an absolute must try if you like German beers, or honestly, if you like beer in general."

Looks pretty good in the glass. Deep reddish amber/brown body. Small white head shrinks to a ring, only a little lacing.

Strong malty aroma with some boiled candy notes.

On tasting, quite sweet, banana and spice notes, good and malty. Abv definitely felt.

Mouth above medium, finish warming with a light layer of sweet spice.

Overall, this one was quite delicious, and went down way too easy. Drinker beware."
Popular,Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4,"I'll preface by saying I went back to my job because I wanted the Eisbock but it turns out we just have this so I didn't exactly get what I wanted but anyways, I don't find this near the banana bomb some reviews say, I wish It was there more, to me this tastes very similar to the Belgian beer Kwak. Heavy on wheat and clove where as the spice and banana is super background. This is really good but idk how much I'd seek this in the future I really wanna try the eisbock"

T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness.

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er.

O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!"
Popular,Hop Rod Rye,4.11,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.

A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.

S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast.

T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot.

M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.

O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie."
Popular,Hop Rod Rye,4.15,"Pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.

Smells of malt and caramel.

Tastes of toasted semi sweet spicy malt with a slightly bitter, alcohol warm finish.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush smooth mouthfeel.

This is an excellent old-school West Coast IPA."
Popular,Hop Rod Rye,4.4,"From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice."
Popular,Hop Rod Rye,3.96,"A really smooth, pleasant quaff. The rye gives it a spicy complexity, but it retains the fruitiness and herbal qualities of a nice brown ale. Biterness is well-balanced, making it easy to drink. Nice, silky mouth feel. Overall, a fun little beer and a nice effort for Bear Republic."

a) Pours a dense 1 finger cap in the smallest glass and HOLDS IT, Lasts, laces, rocks it over a hazed ice tea body.
s) IPA made more bitter, more astringent by rye. But too faint.
t) Taste is abundant. Brings intense bittering, balanced by grainy sweet, whiskey like but hiding ABV well, then cascade of hop citrus, pine, grass, earthy floor, and dank flavors. Some mollasses, dark toasted grain, long finish, with pepper, muskiness, earthiness.
f) Creamy, great mouth feel, luscious. Matches the whiskey, creamy head look.
o) Overall favorite rye (18%!) beer."

My favorite from Ommegang so far."
Popular,Abbey Ale,3.84,"I don't usually review this sort of thing because I drink out of the bottle but because it is an imitation of a Belgian Dubbel it foamed up and would have had a huge head... a lot like me but I'm not a Belgian knock off. I have to slurp up the foam to keep it from overflowing like champagne and like champagne the foam wash fruity and light.

Initially it smells like a white or blush whine but then a bit of malt comes through.

The taste is like other trappist beers I've had. It's extremely fruity with just a little malt and then some bitterness. Like some kind of sparkling wine/beer mix.

It's very foamy and smooth with a ton of soft carbonation. It's finish is lasting fruit and bitterness.

Overall it's much like a few other Belgian Trappist dubbels, trippels and quads I've had. It's the best of those though. I would give it a 4.7 out of 6 as a beer but for the style it would get a 5.7."

Popular,Abbey Ale,4.42,"L: 12oz bottle into a tall, straight-sided glass. Three fingers of dense light-brown foam atop a clear ruby-brown body. Strong retention but only light lacing. Very nice.

S: Good balance of bready malt (pumpernickel?) and fruit. Complex fruitiness, with hints of cherry, red grape, and plum. Some distant peppery spice. Restrained and interesting.

T: Follows the nose, but with more intensity: sweet malt up front, with rich fruit and spice toward the back end. Grape, fig, and some nice nuttiness as well. Dry, yeasty finish with just a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious and nuanced.

F: Medium-bodied and hugely effervescent. Suits the style.

O: Delicious beer, and by far the most authentically Belgian-tasting American version of the style I've ever tried. I'd take this over Chimay Red 10 times out of 10. If it has a flaw, it's that it's a bit boozy for the style, but that's to be expected with its 8.2% ABV. Beer of Fame tick 177/250. Cheers!"

Smell - smells like it tastes. Bold in character, you can tell alot thru smell, if its pleasing to the nose, its pleasing to the palate. Which this is both ways."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.98,"Guinness is where it all started for me. In a world where the challenge was to quaff Genessee Beer until my friends deposited me on my parents’ doorstep and rang the bell, I was introduced to Guinness by an Irish man. He said ‘if you’re going to drink beer, drink Good Beer’. I never forgot that.,.

The One that started my never ending search for Better Stout, I think of Guinness every time.
Familiar, roasty, toasty, just the right amount if carbonation, nice aroma, and, they say, it’s Good For Me.
I’ll have another, please.,."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.89,"Dark and slightly roasted with hints of chocolate and coffee. Bittersweet and pleasant.

However, it is silky smooth and easy to enjoy."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.77,"Black in color with minimal light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering most of the top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark roasted malt and a hint of smoke. I’m tasting dark roasted malt, toasted nuts, and just a suggestion of smoke. The mouth is lightly sticky, chewy, and dry."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.45,"I wonder sometimes what people expect in a beer. I have plenty of friends that drink Coors Light 24/7-365. They must have a corn fetish? Personally I hate ""corn water"". I only concede any ground when the thermometer goes north of 95-degrees and then I'll take a Corona, Victoria, or Modelo...keep the twist thank you. To get to the point I think ""real"" beer should be somewhat complex and accessible. That's what Guiness Extra Stout is. The world's most popular non-alcoholic beverages would include coffee, tea, and cola and it's no mistake that Guiness has elements of all of these universally adored drinks. The complexity comes from the combination of malted grain sugars in the right naturally carbonated mix. Extra Stout has it and regular draught, to me, doesn't even if it has ten nitro balls. Extra Stout has the ""correct"" mouth feel which is refreshing and clean. Extra Stout has the balance of chocolates, coffees, dates, and bitters. It's almost a miracle a rather full and heavy beer is so refreshing and drinkable. Like a great steak there will come a point where enough is enough and more would be an insult. Even so I can drink a whole sixer of this rather full-bodied brew though I'd probably stop at around three or four mostly. I think this may be the world's best beer. Just an opinion like something else. LOL."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.38,"Refreshing, toasty and bitter at the same time.

Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.87,"Guinness Extra Stout is in a class by itself. It's heavy and refreshingly light at the same time. It's not cloyingly thick, but clean.

Smell - some coffee, less dark chocolate, and heavily roasted malts. smells nice and hearty.

Taste - mild coffee-esque bitterness hits the tongue first, followed by light sweetness. black coffee flavor lingers in the finish, which is dry.

Feel - medium bodied, high carbonation, and a bit more boozy than the typical Irish stout at 5.6%.

Overall - relative to Guinness draught, this one is a bit more rough on the edges and packs a slight more punch, both of which I prefer. Happy St. Patrick's Day!"

Dark brown tone, ample foam and sheets of lacing. Lasting surface coverage for the duration of the glass. Mild grainy aroma, very mild roast.

Unfortunately there were some acidity, papery oxidation, and oddly lactic notes. Mild raisin, vague roast and bitterness, not assertive or very flavorful. Fairly smooth, soft carbonation, lightly medium bodied.

A simple, bland stout, easy to drink. Not something i’ll seek out again, unless it’s any port in a storm situation."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.56,"Look: Poured straight from a 11.2 oz bottle. Dark black pour - one of the darkest pours I've seen. Midnight black. A bit of foam depending the way you pour. Some lacing is hanging. quite like hanging Christmas lights up.
Smell: Smells of Chocolate, malts, coffee, maybe even a metallic smell as well.
Taste: Getting notes of stronger coffee even though the coffee isn't very strong compared to imperials - with some light chocolate. Light but noticable. Some malts as well.
Feel: Light bodied drink. Extremely easy to drink. smooth going down - almost can sip this as easily as water.
Overall: Not bad! This beer is world known and I'm glad to have given a review about my experience with it. If you follow what I've said just know this beer is great and definitely worth the try."
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.82,"Cooked up some Irish stew for dinner. Not super traditional, as I had no mutton so I subbed in beef and I also added carrots with the onion and potatoes, but either way it was absolutely delicious. Had some garlic bread too. Decided only a Guinness could go with this meal!

The look is gorgeous in the pint glass. It pours a roasted dark brown/almost black colour, compared to the ruby-ish lighter colour of the draught. Not nitro, so the head is tan/off-white, and lasts about 4-5 minutes but the lacing is good.

Smell was the most underwhelming aspect of this beer. It’s fairly classic, dark roast malts and a strong coffee aroma. But the taste is where it truly shines.

Stouts are my first and truest love, so I’ll be honest. Not sure if I got the freshest, best batch in the world or if other reviews are off, but this was phenomenal. It tastes incredibly roasted, almost slightly burnt at times, malty mocha savoury notes, very creamy, perfect amount of carbonation. Lasts very long in the tongue and mouth, exhaling toasty bready barley notes through your nose. Definitely more bitter than the draught, but not excessively so, the bitterness comes from the darkly roasted malt notes rather than a hoppy bitterness. The last notes after a sip, after they dissipate, is a light and sweet malt in the front of the tongue with mild toasty character in the back.

The benchmark for stouts, in my opinion! It’s somewhat straightforward compared to some others out there, but that’s okay. It’s classic Guinness flavour, doing what it does best, and I was absolutely floored by how good it was. Like I said, either I got a super fresh batch or something magical happened, but this was phenomenal!"

Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.98,"Drinking it out of the bottle. Good taste, not as flat as the draft of the same. Way better than IPAs. Continuing my quest to find the perfect beer, it’s a snipe hunt, but journey is entertaining. Next stop is Pilsner Urquell. You should see the crazy selection at the tiny grocery up street in small town. Crazy selection. Like the 5.3 % alcohol.

This is probably not a summer day beer. But great in winter. Cheers!"
Popular,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.86,"Poured from 11.2oz glass bottle
The look is fantastically dark doesnt let any light through. A tan head that's fine on top bit through the glass the bubbles look larger farther down. This is a traditional CO2 brew only draught is nitro. But the head retention is epic and leaves a layer of foamy head even after sitting for over 15 minutes of slow drinking (and forgetting about it) heavy heavy lacing.

The smell is rich with vanilla and roasty bitterness, maybe some light coffee notes. The fermentation character is present but subtle and there is a light tartness on the nose. Overall creamy and sweet smelling though.

Flavor mostly follows the smell but with more almost savory roasty notes from the malt very smooth and enjoyable, but not very sweet as should be expected from guiness. Some bitterness from the hops bit nothing major just offering balance. Some of that fermentation character does come through slightly as well but not very noticeable. Almost too easy to drink bit very enjoyable.

Feel is creamy yet smooth and very easy to put down not watery and is a bit thick but still quite drinkable. If it came in cans you might be able to shotgun it (but it doesnt) quite a lot of flavor for that though.

Overall a good everyday stout that gives you more than a macro but not to much to be something you cant put down at a party or offend peoples tastebuds with something unfamiliar."

Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast.

Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor.

Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength.

Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque)."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,3.84,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,4.62,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,4.05,"650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!"
Popular,Crème Brûlée,4.45,"Looks: At 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. LOL. Nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. Great lacing on the glass. Smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom.
Smell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination.
Feel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft.
Overall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. At least it would have come closer to filling my glass. I would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink, like desert."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,3.83,"Pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head, 1/4” cap was present for the duration.

Nose is seriously sweet with caramel, brown sugar, sweet cream and vanilla bean.

Flavor begins with caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.

Finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.

Viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising.

Not a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,4.34,"Pours quite dark and fairly clear, appropriate head. Aroma is dark roasted malts and vanilla.

Popular,Crème Brûlée,2.21,"The initial smell is quite nice. But then you take a sip. Utterly disgusting. I tried a second can, same. The sheer number of positive reviews required me to sign up and leave a review. I'm still trying to get the after taste out of my mouth. Absolutely do not recommend."
Popular,Crème Brûlée,1,"I wish I could give these folks a ZERO but its not an option. The Creme Brûlée beers were over pressurized and for the first 3 packs of 4 beers, I opened them over the sink as they would fizz on opening. The beer was in an area with no sun and a constant 69 degrees. A few days ago 3 beers of a four pack exploded. The tops pushed up and blew off. One top severed completely where the flat and round part of the can connect. Two of those cans shot 20 feet into my home spraying beer as they traveled. The third shot upwards to the ceiling. It was a 5 hour clean up job and we are still finding areas we missed and hand washing items that had to be rack dried to remove stale, very sugary, beer. Calling friends, family and my boss to tell them to remove the gifted beer from their home was amusing. The manager where I bought them said Southern Tier had other recalls on their nitros for the same reason so BUYER BEWARE. I called the company and left a message for quality control to call me. That was three days ago and nothing. Clearly Southern Tier does not care about customer service or their customers experience with their product. Had they called back to discuss the issue I would continue to buy their beer. Instead, they have lost a customer for life. There are just too many other good brews out there that I can try instead."

S: horribly, pied-piper-ly, artificially, caramel-vanilla latte ice cream-scented candle smell - super, stupid potent, but rather Coffee-Mate quality (I recently reviewed a beer where the CM fakery was well-nigh suffocating; this may have usurped its ugly stranglehold)...

T: rather artificial, fake flavor renderings; coffee, creme, vanilla wafer... this ain't beer... an alcoholic (and deceptively so) Young's Double Choco Stout (or that barely-palatable Wells Sticky Toffee crud) violently-injected with vanilla Coffee Mate and pungent piney shrubs... mellow roasty, near-tannic bitterness lingering long

Popular,Crème Brûlée,4.35,"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle in to a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brow, almost black color with a tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured.

Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars for a bit of additional sweetness. A very decadent chocolate flavor here indeed. Has a crisp, slightly oily, also smooth and creamy, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around.

This is one of those smacks-you-in-the-mouth hoppy beers. Calling it hop-forward really doesn't do it justice. Great lacing to go along with a copperish colored beer, and the smell is not only citrusy but fruity at the same time. The only nit I have has to do with it's somewhat watery mouthfeel, but it's mostly overlooked by the overall experience you enjoy with this IPA."
Popular,Sofie,4.07,"On tap at the Clybourne brewpub

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat

Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

This is a nice, well rounded Saison. Nothing to seek out but good nonetheless"
Popular,Sofie,4.02,"This is a 12oz. bottle, poured into the Goose Island pint glass. This brew is slightly hazy, a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light. There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes.
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also.
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice.
This is an easy drinker, not heavy, a medium smooth feel."

Popular,Sofie,3.12,"A Saison found the day after Saison Day. Better late, but unfortunately, this was the only one available. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee. Yet, for a once a year change, it wasn't such a terrible thing."

The taste is amazing. Sweet toffee, maple, bready malts, cereal, lemon, orange, a bit of vanilla, slight hoppy bitterness, an earthy note, and a significant floral note. Great balance between sweet fruit/toffee and bitter hops. Wonderful.

Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp. A bit on the dry side. Overall, a fantastic tripel!"
Popular,Triple (White),4.07,"2 inch white, billowing, creamy, thick head with very good retention, that leaves sticky lacing around the glass and forms a rocky, uneven surface as it does recede. Hazy golden amber with very active carbonation.

Strong aroma; I can smell it while pouring. Bready, light fruit, and spice. Sweet-ish.

The initial taste carries indistinct fruit - pear, perhaps, bread, floral, and peppery spice. A solid bitterness begins in the middle, along with some citrus, and continues into the finish and aftertaste. This is the most bitter of any tripel so far for me. The finish brings a bit of an earthy character. The level of bittering is in APA territory, which I was not expecting. In fact, the package of flavors, with the citrus, floral, and bitterness, is more APA than any of the other Belgian-style tripel ales I had. It is very tasty, but certainly different from others in the style. While the aroma seemed to promise sweetness, the finish is quite dry.

Mouth feel has a moderate body with the carbonation bubbles active on my tongue.

Overall, a tasty beer, nothing out of balance, but a bit of an outlier in the company of the other Belgian tripels. It definitely brings more from the hops (citrus and bitterness) than do the others."
Popular,Triple (White),4.43,"Lovely surprise. 33ml bottle purchased at grocery store in Belgium. Poured into IKEA 8 oz. glass. Surprisingly light, spicier and hoppier than I expected, and while you can tell there's a lot of malt involved, crisp, not sweet. Very smooth drinking and no alchohol heat - wouldn't guess it's a tripel. Not a lot of depth, but has the distinctive Belgian yeast banana-y flavors. A fastball right down the middle — nothing fancy, but a very nice example of the style. In the upper range of the 20-odd Belgians sampled this week."

This foam sticks around as a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass. this lattice clings on throughout the tasting.
Aroma is some bready malts and fruity pear notes with a bit of general spiciness, never any booze notes.
First sip reveals a medium body with soft and gentle carbonation.
Flavor is some bready malt, green apple and pears and a bit of sweeter spices, maybe coriander. This isnt cloying or a candy sweet beer but Im not getting any sort of bite from hops nor peppery ABV. I just drank Allagash Tripel before this one and found these to be fairly different beers."

O - Overall this is a fine beer, but tried it immediately after the Chimay Blue, and this Chimay White was not as well-liked. I’m glad I tried it and would recommend it to people looking for a tasty light hoppy beer, but I’m not going to add it to my rotation."
Popular,Triple (White),4.26,"Pours a hazy, amber colour. Even with the most careful of pours, a three finger tight and dense head appears, with another finger tall rocky, foamy head. This is my usual glass goblet, but I don’t know what happened, tons of bubbles are running up all over little spots on the glass. As if there were nucleation points on the side, which there isn’t. As I waited to pour the rest of the beer in, I realized… the head is not collapsing. Not after 5 minutes, not after 15, and not even through the whole half hour I drank this beer. Something happened I’ve never seen before which is that the head actually grew in the initial minutes of the pour and the rocky foamy head coalesced into the middle of the glass like an actual mountain. I don’t know if this was just some crazy unique thing, but it’s so gorgeous looking I honestly want to give it my first ever 5.

Sweet, delicious doughy yeast on the nose. Caramel malts, tasty spices such as pepper, coriander, a hint of cinnamon. A bit of banana and cloves here too. Sugared apricot for the fruity notes. It’s a Belgian, and even more it’s an abbey beer, they just always smell so good.

Taste follows the nose and then some. It is not disappointing at all. There is more balancing hop bitterness here than other Tripels, not citrusy, but a little bit grassy, funky and floral. Doughy yeast and moist, chewy bread flavours are unbelievably pleasant. Tripels and Quads can aim for a few different categories, some have those fruity esters like Westmalle, some aim for the sweet malt rum raisin flavours like Abt 12. Chimay White aims for a pleasant balance. There isn’t as much raisin, rum, dark fruit flavour here however, as the floral and mildly funky, wheaty malts balancing the sweetness and bitterness is more this beers thing. Gentle spices dance throughout the sip as well, mostly cloves. Mild funk adds a slightly savouriness to the beer. Toffee, caramel, and dried candy fruit rinds can also be tasted.

Pleasant and subtle finish that is dry in character, this beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bittersweet on the palate as it dries.

Chimay White occupies a unique space in the Tripel category, but definitely deserves to be ranked higher. It stands out from the crowd and has its own little niche of flavours, enough to stand beside other unique tripels like Westmalle, Tripel Karmeliet, Rochefurt, etc. It’s not quite as malty and sweet as others, but still has pleasant chewy doughiness to it. It doesn’t have the deep molasses, rum, raisin character either, nor does it have tons of fruity esters. It’s very balanced and yet despite that still carries strong notes of its own character.

As for all Belgian Abbey tripels, it’s phenomenal. You really can’t ever go wrong with these brewers in this style!"

While I love Tripel Karmeliet, this has got to be my new favorite Tripel. The balance of malt, hops and yeast is just absolutely superb here, with some sweet caramel malt and toffee, bitter and citrussy hops, as well as fruity and spicy notes that complement each other incredibly well. I really like how prominent the hops are here, with some citrus notes and a good bitterness that prevents this from becoming too sweet against the rich caramel malt backdrop, while those fruity esters really stand out as well, with a good spiciness and great body and mouthfeel as well."

Personally, I love the smoothness and balance of Chimay beers, they are some of the best.

I hope this is good, before I have had only blue and red :)

Beautiful orange amber colour, shines in the light, good froth level, that stays.

Deep, fruit and spice aroma. Apricot prominent. Seriously deep and mystical.

Very citrussy. Really overpowering, though also enjoyably intense. Better than Delirium Tremens as it has much more levels of flavour. Also, better than Duvel for the same reason. The balance of elements is mastered at a much higher level, this is a truly complex flavour on the tongue. The fizziness lasts for about a minute, and constantly changes taste. This is more than just a beer..! It is a creation of pure elegance and complexity.

Is there a bit too much bitterness and orange peel flavour..? For some people, yes. It really depends on one's tastebuds.

It does have elements of Duvel. Though it takes to a new level. However Duvel limited edition tripel that I had a few weeks ago is as good as this, though more apricotty.

For me Chimay are the best Belgian Trappiste brewers by far. Blue is still my favourite ; )"
Popular,Triple (White),4,"It smells funky, fruity and spicy. Like a spiced wine with funky yeast.

It tastes like sparkling wine, cinnamon and other warming spices. It's also fresh and sweet.

It's thin with a ton of bubbly carbonation. The finish is dry, bittersweet and long.

Overall it's a brilliant triple. I give it a 4.8 out of 6."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,"Heavy chocolate and lactose notes, almost like chocolate milk with some malty character. Black body with a brief flash of a dark beige head. Carbonated thick feel. Plentiful coffee notes in the after taste. Very proper stout that is pleasurable to sip. Some savoring of the beer lets out some of the licorice notes and it comes out a little bit more as it warms."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.77,"Pours oily black with a finger of mocha head quickly reducing to a frothy cap, leaving plenty of residual, soapy lacing. Nose is coffee, roasted malt, bitter hop, and dark chocolate. Taste follows suit with the tasting notes in that order. Finishes a delightfully crisp but full feel. Excellent."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,4.35,"L - deep black with a tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing.
S - Lots of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, hints of coffee and licorice
T - follows the nose: roasted dark malt, dark chocolate, molasses, coffee all intermixed with hints of licorice and some hops on the back end. Slight nuttiness
F - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.
O - a really solid sessionable stout here with a relatively complex flavor profile. Very nicely done."

This starts out as the All-American stout: bitter, coffee-driven, big, clean, and dangerously easy.
But licorice is a strange choice of adjuncts. On top of that, over multiple tastings, quite a few dark fruity (ester?) notes come out as it warms. Is this recipe old enough to date from when US breweries were aping English styles? That would explain a lot.
In the end, strong roast cuts across it all. This scratches the itch for anyone looking for something punchy. But would something this idiosyncratic would ever come out today?

A deserving, if shifty, classic."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.94,"DATE: February 5, 2022... OCCASION: a cold Saturday night deserves a flavorful stout... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith tulip pint... this pours a jet black body with a dirty tan head whose thickness settles rather evenly and laces the glass with intricacies... coffee bean, chocolate, licorice, raisin, baked bread and subtle spices, all laid out to a palatable degree... the texture is thick, its presence at the teeth notable, its body bigger than its ABV... the finish is memorable, warming and coating... it hints at the creaminess of a milk stout, the dryness of an extra, and a graininess that sets it in a unique space... the flavor melds chocolate, licorice and cake into a dessert-like experience, its lactic qualities downplayed and its coffee comes to the foreground... the raisin and pepper also arrive in time... I like this as a sessionable beer, substantial yet sippable, flavorful yet not too demanding... it checks off the necessary stout characteristics, and though it may not do any of them excellently, it combines them into a quality product..."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.21,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at 40 degrees F, and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Pours a deep inky black, because, well, stout. Forms a half-finger of pale tan head that vanishes swiftly to a ring.

S: Chocolate and coffee notes dominate the nose, with an underlying backbone of loam and some faint tobacco hints. As it warms, the nose remains similar.

T: The taste follows the nose rather well, at least while refrigerated. Cold coffee and cocoa, with some loamy and tobacco notes. As the beer warms, a rather large bitter ash/pine presence swells up out of the background to claim center stage and hurl everything else into the background - apparently a hop presence that overwhelms my odd palate. Alas.

F: Full and thick, like drinking a warmed syrup.

O: While cold, I enjoy this stout. As it warms and the hop presence manifests, I unfortunately am not as able to enjoy it. Ah well. Please take my taste and overall scoring numbers in reference to the particulars of my palate - though as I enjoy other hefty IBU stouts like Old Rasputin, I feel validated in actually rating and scoring."

L - Dark brown/black, 1-2 fingers of light tan head which settles down to a 1cm thick layer which is unusually dense that sticks around, sticks to the glass very thickly with fine lacing. Beautiful.

S - Dark roasted malt, brown sugar and caramel, with the tiniest bit of licorice in there, no hops that I can spot. Solid stout bouquet.

T - Smoke and blackened malt with very dark chocolate, small but sharp hop profile, licorice is nowhere to be found, the flavor is all somewhat muted actually, almost like everything has been watered down. Feeling pretty letdown here.

M - Medium-heavy body, carbonation is moderate, at least it does drink like a real stout

This one is all over the place. It's gorgeous, it smells great, the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Everything except the actual taste is here. Wish it had some more flavor, this shouldn't be the factor dragging down the rest of the beer."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,4.17,"A very nice looking beer pours pitch black, and dense. I did not expect the slowly rising head you get on bigger stouts one a 6 % one but that’s exactly what happened. A slow to rise creamy mocha tan looking head. Then it settles into rocky terrain creamy froth. As I stated a very nice looking beer.

The aroma to me is big in burnt and roasty. The things that come to mind for me are dark chocolate and dark roast black coffee. Also get a touch of something licorice like.

Tastes is nice burnt dark roast coffee. It also reminds me of those dark chocolates that are high up in the cocoa %. I’d even say there is almost like a burnt tobacco thing going on.

Medium bodied but super smooth. It’s almost creamy because of the carbonation. Very nice big bitter lingering finish. I swear it’s almost like smoking a cigarette with coffee aftertaste. I haven’t had a cigarette in ages but you know you can never get that taste to leave. That’s what this beer does but in a good way."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.51,"Poured moderately hard from a bottle into a snifter glass, quickly forming a few fingers of frothy brown head that slowly faded to heavy and leggy lacing. Deep brown body, totally opaque. Smell is a bit of licorice, moderate and not overpowering. Taste is malty in the background, some bitter chocolate and coffee, and ending with an aftertaste of hops. Drinkable, but really not my kind of stout with the bitterness and hops. Not quite medium bodied, moderate bite of carbonation. Drinkable, but just not my style."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.79,"Appearance:
An impressive, double finger of creamed mocha froth floats steadily on a lake of imperturbable black. But while the head is twice as strong, retention is half as long. What little lace it offers comes in jilted, broken webbing.

Bouquet:
Chestnuts and sips of black coffee hiding in a vast field of dark grains. Hops appear and disappear on the horizon, too distant to rightly identify. While crossing that grain field, straining to get a closer look at those hops, you'll sometimes trip over a gnarled root of baker’s chocolate.

Feel:
Slender and supple, like tucking the tongue under a cooling bedsheet. A low yet continual presence of breezy bubbles brings the hidden hops forward during the linger.

Taste:
Reallllly subtle toasted dark malts speckled with droplets of silky, chocolate milk and topped with crushed chestnuts. A lick of licorice bitters and herbal hops chase away the sugar, maintaining the manly lineage a traditional stout should boast: smooth, roasty, and mildly bitter.

Overall:
Exceedingly mild, the casual drinker may have trouble tasting anything other than “dark beer.” A good starter stout for the uninitiated."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,4,"A classic American stout. I highly enjoyed this, the chocolate and coffee is balanced well with the Itty bitty licorice finish. For some reason I think I like this a bit more than anticipated. Definitely getting again."
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,3.86,"As a new Michigander, I will be exploring the breweries of Michigan.. here is my first entry from Bell's Brewery, their Kalamazoo Stout. Upon opening, an earthy, hoppy, slightly metallic smell greets the nostrils. The brew pours dark, and forms a respectable mocha colored head, which modestly laces as you consume. The taste is good.. a bit overly hoppy to my taste buds, but the hops, and malt form a tangible licorice note atop the chocolate and coffee blend expected from a good stout. The mouthfeel is nice, substantial but not sticky.. this stout goes down smoothly, It tastes better as you go.. I'm looking forward to my second one, already. We have a winner here!"
Popular,Kalamazoo Stout,4.03,"Seems like here lately the IPA craze (not that I mind it) makes it more difficult for me to find the dark beers I love here in Ga.

Smooth, complex dark malts some nice bitterness and alcohol at the end. If you are a stout fan you will enjoy this one. Another good beer from one of my favorite breweries."

Palate Contaminants: other beer

Color is super dark brown that doesn't let any light through, even at the edges. Head is relatively dark, like a chocolate mousse, and the carbonation is fine.

Smell has a lot of prunes, and it's fairly floral. Slightly metallic. I hope I didn't let it sit too long.

Maybe I did. Prunes are still there, and there's lots of charred barrel. Some vague red wine grape, too. Any chocolate is not from the usually eaten part of the plant, more like tree nut husks. I might have a better impression if I was having it with barbecue. Yeah, there's oak, but it doesn't stand well as a flavor in this brew.

Alcohol is pretty well hidden, and the weight is medium for type. Aftertaste is metal and charred wood. Carbonation is fine, but prickly with a swish around the mouth."
Popular,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,3.84,"Bomber into pint glass. Aggressive pour yields a substantial, persistent dark tan head. Dark brown looks black in the glass. Initial impression is dark chocolate, oak, coffee, and roasted malts. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is medium thick, but I was expecting thicker and creamier. Alcohol is remarkably well hidden. Finish is somewhat bitter and a little astringent. Not my favorite Imperial Stout by a long shot, but not bad."
Popular,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.04,"Just when I thought I had reviewed every Yeti out there, here comes one I haven't. Man these have been around, 10 years ago, these were pretty highly sought. Don't hear much these days, but that shouldn't take away from the beer's goodness. Pours a rich black with 2/3"" brown head. Aroma hits the standard roasted and chocolate malt combo along with a sturdy presence of oak on it. Did not know it was both french and American, would say the American is the stronger of the two in this beer, whereas usually french is more noticeable for me. Definitely fits the ""oaky"" descriptor either way.

Taste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%. Solid chewy mouth feel throughout.

Its a good beer, should be interesting to see if it survives as bombers have fallen from grace, I believe they moved the base version into a 4 pack, so who knows what the future holds for this beer that probably deserves to be in the Hall of Fame at this point."
Popular,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.44,"Pours jet black with a thick espresso colored head. Huge coffee aroma with loads of chocolate intermingled.

A - Chalkboard backdrop, conceals, determined carbonation. Proof is the relentless mocha cap, and fine French lacing that clings to the inside of the glass.
S - Bakers chocolate, bourbon barrel, toffee, roast malts, hints of cinnamon, alcohol, rises off the glass, then followed by dried dark fruits, touch of coffee, red raspberry, and tobacco broad leaf.
T - After that aromatic introduction the flavors follow quite well, add some tannin's from the barrel, black pepper, a touch of anise
M - Large feel, rich and bold, starts semi sweet, transitions to a softer feel, bitterness is a theme, the finish is luxurious,
lingering on the cocoa meets bourbon date.
O - Glad to have experienced this with a few years of rest, the feel connotes dessert, the slightly boozy tends to the adult side of our desires. Well worth seeking out, I will try a fresh version against the last 2015 bottle I have resting comfortably. This will be a nice taste test"
Popular,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.3,"The oak barrel aging definitely smoothed out the rough alcohol bite that the regular yeti has. In addition to, the oak barrel has also lessened the chocolate brownie notes that I got with the regular yet, Those notes have mellowed a little bit. It's easier to drink because I don't want to drink a beer that taste like a boozy piece of fudge brownie, but it's nowhere close to being better than the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. Cheers! A-"

Popular,Wookey Jack,4.58,"A really excellent beer that makes me want to explore more black rye IPAs. One of the best looking beers I've ever had--color of a porter on the light side with a head of an IPA. Laces beautifully. It has a short, hoppy nose. Taste is excellent with the dry hops coming out from front to back of the mouth. Feel is a bit boozy and ever so slightly overcarbonated but that's the only real downside. Superior brewmanship from Firestone Walker."
Popular,Wookey Jack,4.56,"Reviewed off a note I made back in 2013 or so, even though the review is being submitted in 2020. Pours inky black, with a tight, small ecru head. Good lacing. The smell is not roasty, but lightly floral and fruity; more apple than berry. The taste is of a smoky, bitter roastiness. There’s a bitter aftertaste, but a clean finish. It’s like bitter chocolate, with a hint of ashes, leaving (perhaps despite these similes) an overall quite good impression. The feel is that of smooth, foamy carbonation. Great beer! Too bad it’s evidently no longer out there."

12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON: 01/05/16"" so a year and 5 months old
$3.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness; A friend of mine introduced me to Wookey Jack about a year ago. He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it's hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can't compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I've got in front of me, given that it's well over a year old, it's surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I'm not sure when this was discontinued but I haven't been able to find it - I'm sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine & More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There's a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it's not bad, I'm still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there's one thing that's missing it's that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I'm going to miss this one. Hopefully I'll come across some that's been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that. This is the best black rye IPA that I've ever tasted, and probably one of my top 10 favorites - or at least one of my top 10 favorite dark beers, that's definite. A moment of silence. ... ... ... Wookey Jack, you will be missed."
Popular,Wookey Jack,3.99,"The appearance has a black body with a three finger off-white foamy head, leaves some clingy slightly foamy lacing in rings. The smell has some slightly roasted coffee. There is some rye, slight citrus/pine coming through in a spicy sort of way. The taste is mainly bitter, some slight coffee - but mainly subdued, hopped - yes, but balanced and extremely flavorful. There is a dry yet bittersweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable - maybe perhaps, and the ABV slightly felt. Overall, I’d say this is very good for a Black Ale and I would come back to this."
Popular,Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.97,"Very dark, like looking into a dark-glass bottle of red wine. Head dissipates quickly but leaves lots of long-lasting lacing. On the nose, immediate smell of ketchup and then sherry vinegar, hints of toast, levels out into some metallic scents and aromas reminiscent of tannic red wine. Flavor seems less complex, red wine aromas are not reflected much here. Tart and sour, again very much like sherry vinegar. Though flavor is very strong it is light in the mouth. Sourness leaves a little tingle as you breath out through the nose. Sweetness and metallic notes present well into the finish. Carbonation seems lower (which I like). Good experience but not to be drank regularly."

On tasting, it's quite well balanced, slightly more to the sweet side. Goes down very easy. Notes of dark berry fruit, red wine.

Mouth medium, finish fruity and a little drying.

Overall, an enjoyable drink. Tart, sweetness, and sour all seem to blend into each other, each occasionally rising to the top before falling away."

Popular,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.04,"Poured semi vigorous, was late getting phone and head had dissipated to what you see now. It is actually pretty appealing though, a nice dark brown/red hued color with a creamy ring around the glass. Some floaties hanging out too.

Smell is interesting and very unique...I keep getting all sorts of different smells each time. First it was all acetic, the came some tart cherry, then I got a weird funky note that almost reminded me of cheese, yes its definitely there, but it only shows itself every now and then; last note grape skin. At this point I'm very curious what this one tastes like...

Wow, that is certainly not what the nose told me it would be. Sure the sour and acetic are there but it is actually a lot sweeter than I would've ever expected. It is almost like cherry candy at first that quickly goes tart, reminds me of sour patch kids in reverse. There is also some baking spice notes that were no where to be found on the nose. I didn't pick up on oak initially but it does show itself in the aftertaste fo rme.

Mouthfeel is medium, typical belgian carbonations, a beautiful combination of both sweet and mouth puckering sour; they mingle on the tongue in perfect balance.

Trying Belgian beers like this is always a treat for me. I don't drink them often but every time I do it seems I find myself being taken on a sensory trip all over the place. So many different aromas, then tastes and all always balanced in such a perfect way."
Popular,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,"Pours a deep dark amber-cherry colour, the light carbonation at first might fool you as it grows into a two inch bubbly head, that collapses into a persisting one inch, soft fluffy head that lasts well over ten minutes. The lacing is off the charts on my tulip glass

While many beers have that citrus zest smell on the nose, Duchesse has much more of a juicy smell instead. Dark cherries and malt are strongest here, Oak-y wine like must smells swirl around as well.

Those wine like notes are up front for sure, the sourness is a light, tart cherry, and general fruitish notes (green apple, blackberries, oh, and wine grapes of course with that sourish thick skinned vinous chew). Nice subtle long finish, the malt backbone lasts the longest, and the gentle sourness finishes very sweet.

Disagree with the review(s) that said it was one dimensional. This absolutely opens up, not just as the beer warms, but on the sip as well. The Oaky, wine, grape must notes are strong at first with the sweet sourness before opening up with some dark cherry notes. Mouth watering at this stage. And yet, it finishes dry and you get the real malty sweetness, notes of apple, blackberries, maybe raspberries but I’d at least say general juicy tart fruits.

Soft carbonation that creates a gentle sip that goes down easy, but enough lasting carbonation to support a head that collapses into a thick fluffy one inch line that lasts almost the entire duration of the drink. Gentle sour notes pucker the tongue slightly before opening up.

I haven’t had many Flanders red ales or lambics, krieks, etc in a long time so I can’t say this is a benchmark, but it certainly feels like it. Overall the looks, tastes, smells of this beer are gorgeous and it’s not overwhelming on any one area to scare anyone off. If you want a beer that goes hard in any direction I’m sure you could find it, but Duchesse de Bourgogne has the balance and yet complexity to absolutely satisfy, a gorgeous well priced sour"

O: Overall it’s a very good beer. Not my favorite style, nor is this my favorite in the style, but I recognize and appreciate that it’s one of the standards. 4.25"
Popular,Vanilla Porter,3.35,"Poured from a 12oz can best by January 29th 2023

On the poured a khaki 2 finger head formed, then started slowly dissipating. Body is a dark brown that lets some red light through. Low carbonation and no lacing.

Smell is not very clean. Kind of smells like guinness and super cheap lager got together. Some vanilla and chocolate come through, but this smells kinda dirty.

Taste loses most if not all of the dirty beer vibe. Its a pretty traditional if not a bit average porter. Sweet and a bit vanilla-y so not bad but I wish it was smoother and maltier.

Feel is light for the style. Slightly mouthcoating, but it finishes dryer than expected. It honestly feels a bit conflicted. Not bad but this beer is all over the place.

Overall it's another Breck brewing beer. They really aren't my favorite brewery out there, but they aren't the worst. It's a dark beer that has almost nothing wrong with it, except for the fact that it's lacking identity. A vanilla dark beer that wants to be drinkable and a crowd pleaser but still coming off as craft, and sellable alenought that A-B can sell it nation wide."
Popular,Vanilla Porter,2.8,"Look: Dark red, no head

Smell: I can’t really describe it, but it smells good

Taste: Watery to me, not what I was expecting at all, hint of vanilla

Overall: It’s fine, that it. Nothing more, nothing less."
Popular,Vanilla Porter,3.55,Pour a very effervescent dark copper with slightly less than a finger of head. The nose has mild vanilla notes. The vanilla is assertive in the flavor but there's not really a corresponding roast to counteract the sweetness of the adjunct.
Popular,Vanilla Porter,3.53,"From a can. Caramel color with a thin layer of tan colored head. Smells of roasted malt, a little faint. Medium body, well carbonated. Roasted malt and vanilla flavors. Exactly what the name promises."
Popular,Vanilla Porter,2.89,"Almost no scent when the cap comes off, this porter developed a nice tannish head but quickly lost it. The color is a very transparent reddish mahogany and is accompanied by the subtlest vanilla and a little cream... like the liquid accompanying a chocolate-covered cherry. The taste is totally vanilla, kind of like what my younger self imagined vanilla extract would taste like. It feels very much like a cream soda... round, easy to drink, and some carbonation going down. This is fine, I may get it again if in the mood for a lighter porter in warmer weather."
Popular,Vanilla Porter,2,"Look: Dark brown to black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Minimal lacing.

Smell: Vanilla with some light chocolate.

Taste: Very disappointing taste. The vanilla wasn't perceived whatsoever and left me with a horrible lingering aftertaste.

Feel: Medium to high carbonation.

Overall: Very disappointed with this one, particularly the taste. The vanilla wasn't at all noticeable and the flavor profile was unexceptional that left me with a bad aftertaste."
Popular,Duet,4.03,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?"
Popular,Duet,4.59,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA."
Popular,Duet,4.14,"Really solid beer. I had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what I remember or just what I expected in a West Coast IPA, but really a great beer. I have rounded my 'overall' up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. I downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking ('hazy') and feeling ('juicy') like a NEIPA is not a positive for me. I was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. Nonetheless, I loved the foamy pour, the piney smell, and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. There's no doubt I would have this again."
Popular,Duet,4.38,"Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).

Cheers"
Popular,Duet,3.7,Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.
Popular,Duet,4.56,Wonderful beer. Piney aroma along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Earthy pine dominates. Medium body and carbonation on the feel. This is an outstanding representation of what I would classify as a West Coast IPA. I use to be able to get this beer at Total Wine in Virginia in bottles. Then it disappeared. Now I can get it only in cans which is better than not at all. It has become my everyday go to session IPA although the cost continues to go up. Still well worth a try.
Popular,Duet,4.37,Very piney and floral hops with a moderate bitterness. Some tropical fruit and citrus too. Lots of hop character. Finishes clean and with a malty sweetness.

Smell isn't overpowering but definitely picking up nice tones of grape, berry, apple and light citrus. Pine and earth linger in the background.

Picking up some grape in the taste but also a decent amount of pine and resiny bitterness.

Slightly thin mouthfeel but sticky. Medium carbonation. Bitter resiny aftertaste.

Overall a really nice WCIPA. Excited to find this freshish (~1 mo) in these parts."

They know what they're doing out in Alpine, California.

Damn it, this is a good beer and I can drink it. You should, too.

Hey, there's some stuff on the label. Let's read it: ""A West Coast IPA that features Amarillo and Simcoe hops ""in harmony,"" giving a bright, floral aroma. Duet is nicely bitter with the perfect amount of malt concealed behind the hoppy goodness. Immensely drinkable, amazingly nimble on it's feet."""

Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.36,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.6%, OG 1085, IBU 66.6. Beautiful amber to copper colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of fruity American hops, old marmalade, caramel and crystal malts, alcohol. The flavour is very sweet, and the alcohol is not well hidden, but soon overpowered by a massive hoppy attack. Warming mouth- and throatfeel.Maybe too much of everything, but still a guilty pleasure to drink."
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.93,"The pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amber-brown fluid, closest to 16 on the SRM chart. There's a nice light biege head atop, but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. There is rich body here, as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. The initial taste is good, malty but with some hop contributions. What kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste. If a honey like finish to a beer sounds good, here it is."
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4,12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine. Full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of pine and grapefruit. More of a strong IPA.
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.91,"This here is the one that turned me onto American Pale Ales.

I think APA is now my favorite beer and it's thanks to Undercover Investigation Shutdown and others like it.

Doesn't look or smell too special but it tastes like a million bucks. For the high abv, you mostly just taste the hops and it is DELISH.

One of my top 5 beers I always look for and enjoy in season.

Great job, Lagunitas!"
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.08,"Appearance: Clear amber color with a modest-sized light beige head that slowly faded. Nice looking beer.

Smell: Pine forward hop aromas with some mild fruit notes.

Taste: Moderate nondescript fruit notes with some moderate pine hop notes. The beer starts off mildly sweet but works its way to a fairly dry final finish.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

Overall: A good easy drinking Strong Ale,"
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.07,"This is a real treat, bought as part of a mix-a-six at Bartonsville Giant. Poured out of 12 oz. bottle into pint glass.

L: Pours a rich cascading copper amber, with a big solid head that slowly recedes, leaving plenty of sticky lacing behind. Hazier than most beers I drink.

Smell: Sweet but rich. I detect rye bread, malt, toasted caramel, and honey. Notes of vanilla and tobacco emerge as it warms. Also a very mild, almost stale fruit note.

Taste: Luscious and luxurious. At first the hops tingle your tongue with bitterness, then you get the sweetness of the caramel and malts. There's something complex and smokey towards the back of the throat, like beef jerky. No burn whatsoever, and no tricks to hide the booze. For a beer of this alcohol content it is remarkably well balanced.

Feel: Very little carbonation. Still, the beer doesn't feel flat or sticky at all. Very smooth and clean, somewhat chewy and thick but not overly heavy.

Overall: Great beer. Most of the time I'm too broke to buy stuff like this but I decided to treat myself tonight. I'm glad I did. This isn't the most refreshing beer but it might just be the most palatable high-ABV offering you can buy."
Popular,Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.09,"A: Pours a one finger head. Deep caramel amber.

S: Sugary piney hops. Molasses, dark citrus, a nice pungency that keeps it grounded. Lemon to balance it out. Alcohol is definitely present

T: Starts off with a bready sweetness, culminating in a spicy grapefruity taste before a mild hop bitterness creeps and fills the mouth. The hop sensation lingers for awhile, creating a slight warming sensation.

O: The alcohol is hidden well. This is a sticky sweet malty beer that's saved by a hop cleanse after every sip"

Popular,Imperial Biscotti Break,3.99,"Presentation: 16 oz. can with a batch number on the bottom but no dates. Served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: The tan, one and a half finger head stays around for a bit and leaves behind a lot of lacing that covers the entire glass. It's a deep, black color.

Smell: It's a strong, sweet aroma at first of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and even raisins. There's also some coffee in there as well as honey roasted almonds.

Taste: It's a warm flavor of heavily toasted bread, coffee and a touch of roasted nuts in the aftertaste. It's mostly bitter all around with not much sweetness, if any, coming though. 

Mouthfeel: It's quite thick and moderately smooth but there's a medium high carbonation crispness in there too that's very noticeable. 

Overall: A delicious beer with a lot of character and complexity. The texture is not bad, exactly, but it has a lively carbonation that's not expected for the style. It doesn't ruing the beer but it would be better served by a smoother, lower carbonation mouthfeel."

Mild mouth & stomach heat with adequate carbonation. Medium viscosity. Evil Twin makes some outstanding beers & this is one of them."
Popular,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.34,"Canned 11/16/20

You know it's odd with this one. I was intrigued when I saw it on the shelf so I said fuck it and just picked it up without much thought. I figured it was a fun, but ultimately throwaway pastry stout. It is only now that I come to review it that I realize it's actually held in pretty high regard here. Hopefully then I'll be getting something that's less gimmicky than I expected

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dark khaki head that fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing

This definitely has a defined sweetness in the nose, but it's hidden behind a pretty substantial roast. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy fudge, roasty espresso, creamy vanilla, earthy whiskey (weird bc it's not barrel aged), and some general nuttiness

There is also an incredible balance taste-wise between the dessert aspects and the straight up roasty stout notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting toasted almond, roasted malt, lightly acidic coffee, milk chocolate, and rich vanilla. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of fudge, soft oak, rich vanilla, dry roasted peanut, and roasted malt

A medium full body pairs with mild tingly carbonation, resulting in a super silky beer that never feels bogged down by the abv or the sweetness. Finishes mostly dry with a sweetness that slowly fades

For a non-BA imperial stout, this had a ton of complexity. Even with what some might consider ""unnecessary adjuncts"", this beer impressed me quite a bit"

Looks amazing, chunky and looking like DUFF otherwise. Smells like funk and sweet barley. Taste has subtle banana sweetness, grassy hops that are medicinally bitter, hints of pepper and clove. Complex. Dry and well carbonated, the 6.5% is just perfect, and this drinks way too easy sitting there

The perfect summer beer: good for pool time, grilling, brown bagging it in the park, whatever"
Popular,Saison Dupont,4.33,"This beer is exactly what I thought, years and years and years ago when I first heard of real craft beer, that it would look and taste like.

Pours a beautiful light orangey straw like colour, moderately cloudy in the glass. Four inches of rocky creamy head, like a little mountain, abide in the glass for a long time, even when it collapses 15 minutes later there is a layer of 1 inch thick head remaining. Simply put, it’s absolutely gorgeous.

This has a genuine barnyard smell on the nose. This is a generic phrase you hear a lot for saison and some other Belgian ales, but it is absolutely true here. Maybe because this is brewed at an actual farmhouse (they also produce bread locally and cheese you can buy) Leather and straw smells are strong, with some mild yeasty notes. Earthy, dirt like mist hits with the yeasty smells, like opening a wooden door on a dew-y, mildly humid summer morning. I’m not kidding, that’s not just flavour description, it really smells like that.

Taste is wonderfully complex. You might get hit with lemon upfront on some sips, or grassy hop bitterness on others, I think it depends how much you sip with how much air. Evolves to a mouthful of sourdough bread and yeast after a few seconds. Barnyard funkiness is all over, waning in and out of the other tastes. Yeast, citrus, fresh straw can also be noted throughout the tasting.

Medium body that ends with a sharp crispiness and dryly. Goes down smooth and easy, with the absolute perfect amount of carbonation. With my reviews I’ve always tried to do short, 3 paragraphs with straightforward descriptions, and I tried to keep it here too. Everything I wrote you absolutely will smell and taste, it sounds like a flowery review but that’s just because this beer is just that good. I’m looking forward to getting a bunch more as soon as possible and cellaring a couple bottles for the future. An absolute benchmark of the saison style and a recommendation to absolutely anyone who loves beer. Saison Dupont is remarkably complex and maybe most importantly, unbelievably delicious."

L - Light gold color with very slight haze and constant, mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer. Huge, pillowy, frothy, off-white head that lasts and lasts.

S - Big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange, but with another earthy note, similar to pineapple. There is a bit of bready malt in the finish, very restrained, like a saltine cracker.

T - Strong, citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately, with navel orange, grapefruit and pine. The hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. Exceptionally clean fermentation, with no yeast fruitiness noted.

F - Medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect, yet somehow the finish feels dry. Moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. Hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. Alcohol presence fairly high, which matches the listed ABV, but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.

O - This is a world-class American IPA, on the aggressive end of the style's spectrum. It slams your senses unapologetically, and I love it for that."
Popular,Head Hunter,4.96,"Head Hunter has a thick, ivory head and a bubbly, gold appearance, with moderate lacing. The aroma is of white bread crust. The flavor is of intensely-bitter hop resins and sweet, white bread crust. Head Hunter has a high-medium body and a drying finish.

T: The dank, piney, resinous aspects of the flavor are much more prominent but blend well with the fruitier qualities of grapefruit, pineapple, and guava.

Popular,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.07,"From a can into a pint glass. Pour has a vibrant, slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. Scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). Taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. Feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. An all around excellent fall beer that is very, very drinkable."
Popular,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,"This one I really like.

Poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didn't last that long, but overall it still looked good in the glass.

Aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype, and even the nectar part, as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction.

This one had a nice complexity between hops, malt and hazelnut. I will absolutely buy it again. It was also nice to have an English brown ale, as this style is not very common in South tx"
Popular,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.4,"First, this is a well carbonated beverage. But it doesn't produce a ridiculous amount of beer head. In fact, the lightly biege head is very modest, although somewhat enduring. The brew itself is a solid brown color that's opaque, but far from murky. The aroma is malty and the described hazelnut addition is definitely subdued. That aspect isn't even in the initial taste. But then, as the brew lingers toward its finish, the hazelnut explodes. This is a truly unique drinking experience and a good one, should you like hazelnuts. As a brown ale there's no expectation of hoppiness and this is true to that style. That this can convert a mild malt character into one with such a hazelnut infusion is admirable. This may be another limited audience brew, but it's a great choice for anyone that likes their brown ales with a hazelnut flavoring. This best part, it adds a nutty aspect without any additional sweetness."

Not bad overall, an easy drinking hazelnut porter."
Popular,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.19,"Very slightly hazy mahogany brown color with a nice moderate tan head that retrains well but produces very little lacing.

The taste is light sweet malt, biscuits, a touch of brown sugar and nicely light hazelnut with just enough floral hops for a nicely balanced overall flavor, nothing overpowering or too understated
The body is light/medium and very smooth with mild carbonation.
Overall, just a really pleasant brown ale, very nice."
Popular,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,"Nutty: my favorite.

L- On the pour I got a 1finger head, as I drink there is light lacing. It is a deep reddish brown and the beer is almost hazy which is interesting, hopefully normal, but kinda cool.

S- the hazelnut flavor definitely comes through and it compliments the yeast they used nicely. Not a lot of hops on the nose, but that's kinda the point.

T- A warm (feeling/tasting) malty tidal wave of flavor dissipates into a pretty subtle hazelnut flavor with very light bitterness that also reminds me of a nut, not a lot of hops again.

F- the feel is mostly consistent and overall enjoyable but if you think about it there is a slick lens that comes right before a dryness but that's quite easy to move past

O- the flavor profile carrys this beer into nut brown ale stardom, as the hops from american craft brewing remove some of the nutty qualities from this english style. Sam smith still beats them out, but this is much more accessible and attractive to modern audiences."
Popular,Dark Lord,4.42,"Pours a deep dark brown with moderate cappuccino head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin ring around the edge of the glass.

Big aromas that burst from the bottle upon opening. Sweet milky coffee, dates, stewed fruits. A little charred food sits in behind.

Sweet vanilla hits the tongue first. It’s followed by coffee, much milder dates/figs/raisins. The sweetness stays for the duration, but isn’t over the top or unwanted. Again, in the background there is a charred food/ashy quality that I like. Not boozy in the least.

This is a big bodied beer. Thick without verging too far into syrupy territory. Long finish.

I really enjoyed this beer I’ve heard about for so long. Very glad to have tried it."

Popular,Dark Lord,4.38,"2019 vintage.

An aggressive pour resulted in a small amount of short-lived head that once gone left behind a cool looking swirl. Nice legs. Color is dark brown with a hint of light showing through around the very edges.

Aroma is fantastic and bursts from the glass. It's sweet with plenty of vanilla. There are some underlying notes that I'm having trouble distinctly naming, but they add a nice depth to the aroma.

Taste is really nice, and quite complex. There's a roastiness that wasn't apparent on the nose, with the vanilla & sugar present but well balanced. Hints of fig lurk in the background. Overall, it's plenty sweet but hovers just under the threshold where it would be too much. Feel is medium full. Very smooth, and low carb. An easy sipper.

Overall, this is excellent."
Popular,Dark Lord,4.24,"2020 Vintage

Pours pitch black, oily and viscous. A thin, weak mocha colored head forms on the beer momentarily before dissipating leaving no residual head behind. The head retention is not great, but otherwise its a nice looking beer. The aroma on this is interesting. Initially I got dark fruits when I poured it - lots of prune, raisin and even some port, along with a lovely vanilla note. As Im sitting here sipping it, I am getting much more of this umami, almost soy sauce aroma on this one. Now that I have got that on the brain I cannot shake it. That being said, there are some notes of roasted malts, barley, coffee, and vanilla. There is a certain sweetness to the beer that is clearly present on the nose.

The taste is very complex with a lot going on with this beer. So there are the notes of roasted malts, with notes of dark fruits - prunes, raisin, port wine - all coming in. There is a surprising level of sweetness to this beer that accentuates those fruity notes. As those move across the palate there are notes of fruity coffee, and some piney hops. The finish is where that umami/soy character on the nose comes in on the flavor. The finish then has that umami soy with a slight salty note - although that may just be my mind playing tricks on me from that soy flavor. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish as well with some light piney notes. Feel is medium bodied but rather viscous. Moderate carbonation.

Overall a complex and delicious Russian imperial stout from Three Floyds. I can certainly see why this beer earned the reputation it enjoys in the craft beer community. That being said, I can also see why it does not have the same cache it once had. Its an old school beer that just does not seem to fit in the current stout trends. Thank you so much @ovaltine for sharing this one with me."

Popular,Dark Lord,4.86,"Green with sparkles wax - 2017 - enjoyed July 2021.
Poured pitch black with a burnt coffee color head and lacing. The aroma was milder than expected but still very good; malts and coffee and dark cocoa, no hops found.
The taste was able to meet my elevated expectations. Of stouts I have had, I don’t think that I have had one better and I’m not sure I’ve had it’s equal. All the malts and coffee and cocoa (flavors from the malts and hops as no additives were used to my understanding) merge into a flavor that fills your mouth and makes you want more.
The feel was excellent, a bit thinner than I expected but that was when I still thought it was BA, which it apparently isn’t.
OA - outstanding stout. The only knock is that it’s so freaking hard to get."

No alcohol burn but a nice warmth on the finish. This bottle was only slightly aged but I still have a 2nd in the cellar which I'll age for many more years ;)"
Popular,Dark Lord,4.76,"2020 bottle purchased from a private collection for $25. Super excited i found it. I like the mystique surrounding this beer. Only available once a year. Only available at the brewery in Indiana. Rated super highly. Many derivative versions that are also rated highly, if not higher and single bottles that trade for hundreds of dollars in private circles on the internet. The multicolored waxes that adorn each year's vintage. The black wax that adorns mine. It's my son's birthday, so that seems like a good occasion to drink it.

Poured out a heavy dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy one inch head that dissipates into a ring around the glass. Scents of dark raisins and other fruits, a bit of vanilla. The smell isn't very strong, rather on the weak side so i had to swirl my glass several times to release the aromas. Upon sipping, I'm greeted by raisin and rich sweet chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Perhaps a chocolate covered cherry. Notes of char and leather are present. Coffee is used in this brew but it's not too strong. The brew is mostly a sweet wash, with just a little bit of bitterness to balance it, hovering on the back end as it washes down my throat. Dark Lord is thick and syrupy, just the way I love my stouts, and sticks to my lips, sweetening them long after the swallow. Overall this is a beer to enjoy as a meal in and of itself, as it is hearty and rich, bold and strong at 15%ABV.

I've read that this stout was there before stouts really came into their own, and that the overall field has risen to meet the standards this beer once set. It's better than some stouts, like i like it better than Old Rasputin, but in fact it is comparable in overall savory flavor to some Hoppin Frog stouts like TORIS. So while once upon a time some may have journeyed far and wide to experience this flavor, i think one can obtain beer just as good as this without searching too far from home. However, what an experience! And I feel like I've now joined a secret club. The Dark Lord club."
Popular,Dark Lord,4.22,"Bottle, 2009 vintage, kindly shared by gunnar. Black colour, hardly any head. Aroma of heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee and liquorice. Intense flavour of roasted malts, coffee and liquorice."
Popular,Dark Lord,4.16,"Thank you eppie82 for this one!

2019 Vintage (purple/glitter wax) poured into a balloon stem at 50°F.

Pours a deep cola brown - fairly fluid, abd sitting coal black in the glass, with no real head. A swirl forms a dark brown collar and some cling along the glass.

Nose: Big, bold roast lends some baker's chocolate, cacao, burned toffee, brown sugar, and a deep, almost savoury character. Yes, I understand where the ""soy sauce"" descriptor comes from. A bit of a meaty character, with some char and marmite, but this seems to be a product of the heavy roast. Some underlying dried cherry dark fruit. Definitely unique.

Palate: Before I start, I will say that the savoury soy sauce note is strictly limited to the aroma. It doesn't show up here. Moving on. A few things stand out first. One, this stout is sweet. Very sweet. That unique concentrated cane flavour of the Indian sugar is present, along with the sweetness. Lots of sweet, tarry molasses, brown sugar, and even a blackstrap rum thing going on. The vanilla is definitely lending character, but not like a ""vanilla stout"" - it's tame, identifiable, and well-balanced. I'm not getting any coffee. The malt itself is so classically Russian, with big, super dark roast, earthy char, and all those bold roasty notes. The hops are also very old school, with earthy, leafy bittering hop character meshing with the roast. Approaching the finish, vanilla fades, and the blackened roast and earthy hops take over, pushing some sweetness out, lending some earthiness and char, but very little bitterness. The finish highlights this, with a touch of molasses.

Mouthfeel/Body: While it didn't appear so on the pour, wow is this one fudgy. Full-bodied, heavy, thick, and chewy, while not crossing the line into syrup territory. It isn't close to BBT or Assassin thick, but it's certainly in that same vein of luscious and fudgy. There's actually some nice, fizzy, albeit fine effervescence that pokes through a bit. Definitely some residual stickiness.

Overall: This is an interesting stout. Today, we're inundated with all of these mega pastry stouts brewed with half a bakery. While there are ""adjuncts"" in here - vanilla, coffee, and Indian sugar, those flavours are dialed way back, to the point of almost feeling like a plain stout. It's the sweetness that really stands out. On top of that, it's the only dessert stout I've had that retains that classic Russian Imperial flavour profile, and that's unique. Picture a dessert Russian Imperial Stout. If that sounds good, then this will likely deliver."

Not a sugar bomb like it has come to be known for."
Popular,Shiner Bock,2.91,"Truth in advertising here, almost to a fault. Copperish color, a tad off whit foam head that disappeared within a minute or so. N lacing.

Popular,Shiner Bock,4.98,"A great Texas-take on a German-style beer, which is more lager, than a traditional German Bock beer. Lacing was decent.

And yes.... every drop is still very much brewed in Shiner, Texas. Their brewery tour in Shiner is pretty cool."
Popular,Shiner Bock,3.79,"Undated bottle. Nice clear dark ruby with a brief off-white head. Tastes a lot like a lager, but with roasted malts and a bit of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy.

Popular,Shiner Bock,3.68,"Poured from an undated 12 oz. bottle: beautiful, clear garnet red with a quickly receding, foamy white head.

The aroma is somewhat subdued with ""lager-like"" aromas of spicy malts and faint hops.

Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is quite light and subtle to be an authentic ""bock"" beer that tends to be full-bodied and somewhat thick; however, this is a good ole American style version that is a thirst-quencher for hot summer days in Texas as well as the rest of the USA. The initial flavor is slightly tangy with malts and hints of molasses. The hop complement and zesty carbonation keep this one refreshing and quaffable. I almost detect a little rye in the aftertaste. At 4.5 % ABV, this one has a lot of flavor. The body is thin and the carbonation is quite high with a slick mouthfeel. I should drink this more often. Good buy from Wal-Mart."
Popular,Shiner Bock,3.94,"Better than most of the macro brews, but firmly in the macro brew camp. Definitely hits the spot after a day fishing (one of my go to beers for that)."
Popular,Shiner Bock,3.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, undated

On the pour a relatively weak 1 finger head forms then dissipates to a ring around the glass. Despite that lively carbonation ensues. The color is darker than amber, solidly brown and crystal clear. Some lacing tries to form a few sips in, but fails.

Aroma is quite light with a decent amount of generic, yet clean lager smell. No hops are really present, which is expected, and some sweet dark malts hide in the back with a vague caramel vanilla note and offset the relatively bright and almost tart lager note. However the aroma is very mild almost bland. Nothing off though.

Flavor follows the smell, but brings more malts with less sweetness. Lager character dominates this beer with malt being more of a background experience, however it is present. Relatively light, and the flavor isn't all that dark or complex.

Feel is easy to put down, but not really a bock. Very light and more like an American lager. In that category however this would do very well. It's light but still maintains body and doesn't just disappear. Nice and bubbly with a decent bite. Still bigger than coors or bud, but nowhere near a real bock.

Overall this is a good beginner beer, to bring someone over from only drinking light colored non hoppy lagers to the darker side of things. Also good for someone who likes lagers and dark beers (mostly lagers) and just doesn't want to think too much. Not complex and closer to an American lager than a bock despite the color. More yeast driven than malt driven, but clean and nothing bad about it other than lack of complexity and inspiration."
Popular,Shiner Bock,3.11,"Keeping in mind that this is an American Bock, and not a European style, expect this beer to be less aggressive on all counts.
A medium brown color, light tan head that doesn't last very long. Bubbly, like a soda.
Nose is light malt, no hops at all, which is actually good for the style.
Taste is a light roasted malt flavor with some raisin-like aftertaste. Just the slightest hint of hop bitterness but no hop taste at all. Very, very light body. Too much carbonation for my liking.
Judging this for what it is, it's an okay American bock."
Popular,Shiner Bock,3.58,"L - Poured from a draft into pint glass. One finger light off white head. Deep amber color. Clear with no inclusions. Some lacing that fades quickly.

S - Sweet bready malt up front. Some caramel notes

T - Some bitterness up front, but the maltiness takes center stage. Fades quickly. The malt flavors seem like a little caramel and a faint scent of roastiness.

F - Medium to thin mouthfeel. Light carbonation from the draft pour

O - As a Texan, I’ve had this many times, but this is my first time since trying more beers for review. The taste is good, but being a bock, the expectation is for “more.” More flavor, stronger flavors, etc. It’s fairly mild overall, but that means it’s easy to drink. Like a lot of the regionally famous beers, it’s highly easy to drink a lot of them. It definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend checking it out just to see what another regional standard tastes like."

The aroma is not too strong, but sweet. Bubblegum, and a bit of banana.

The flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. The middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. Behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. The finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. This aftertaste is exquisite!

The mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, I keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. Moderate body.

Karmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet. The feel of the aftertaste is, as I stated above, exquisite. Wow!

Life can be an utter nightmare, devoid of pleasures and amounting to nothing more than a rigorous course of turmoil for damned souls, so once in a while you need a reminder that there might be more to this realm, and this is one such reminder, in beer form. Looks like a snowglobe, filled with various films and floaters. Smells like warm grain and banana. Powdery feeling, dry, banana and clove and honey, sweet but w/ burps of fuel sitting at 8%. Thanks for the brief reprieve you Belgian wizards"

Grassy hops in the nose with a hint of citrus.

Taste follows with some biscuity malt backbone.

Crisp clean finish.

Could see this being great on a lake, as nature intended. Not a bad American pils."
Popular,Summerfest,3.98,light crisp and refreshing. definitely would drink again. not heavy at all. perfect light craft style beer. perfect for casual easy drinking. i love it a lot. one of my faves
Popular,Summerfest,3.34,"Appearance: Straw/pale gold, brilliant clarity. Head an opaque white with mid-size bubbles, lasts about 5 mins.
Aroma: White bread, toast. Light and quick.
Taste: Malt: White bread, oats/wheat, nutty, very light caramel. Hops: Floral/lemony.
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, slick-ish feel.
Overall: Light, sessionable summer lager. Poolside beer. A little extra hop bitterness/bite than your typical. Lemony, goes well with pasta. Good by itself, inoffensive."
Popular,Summerfest,3.24,"As I sit on a rock in the shallow waters of the Pemigewasset River, I can't help but to sit an enjoy my fleeting moments of Summer with this years Summer Fest Lager. It has a pleasant golden glow that glistens like the water that runs over the white rocks. It is crisp like the brisk water that cool you off from the sun's August rays. Some earthy notes tickle your nose and you then taste this beer's lemony, malty goodness that ends with a slight bitter after taste. All in all a solid summertime lager, but nothing too fancy."
Popular,Summerfest,3.96,"Look: Lovely clear gold just what a pilsner should look like. One finger head that dissipated quickly. Slow rising bubbles but not a lot.
Smell: Earthy spicy noble hops over a nice bready malt
Taste: Surprisingly sweet at first. Bold and hoppy (like a pilsner of course, not hoppy like an IPA). Great balance between hoppiness and maltiness. And between sweet and bitter, obviously leaning more toward bitter.
Flavor: Tastes like a sunny afternoon in a Prague café. Herbal with lemon zest. Bready malt with a softer peppery bitterness.
Feel: Medium mouthfeel, clean crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. Dry bitter finish.
Overall: I have tried to steer myself away from drink all IPA’s all the time, so this is another in a stream of pilsners that I have tried. American Brewers are nailing pilsners, Everyone I taste is as good or better than the last. Looks great in the glass smells like what I used to think was a pilsner that was of European origin. When I was in Europe in 1980, I was embarrassed of behalf of American beer. The beers I drank in Europe inspired me to drink European beers for all of the 80’s and well into the 90’s. We obviously gained a lot of ground when IPA’s swept the beer landscape. I don’t know when American brewers began to equal the great pilsners of Europe, but they have."
Popular,Summerfest,4,"Light gold, pretty clear and a slight amount of head with some lacing. On first whiff you notice bready malts with that ubiquitous Sierra Nevada aroma that runs like a thread through most of their lighter ales and lagers. The taste is a nice peppery hop snap with a smooth malt backbone, biscuity, and a little herbal. It’s also well carbonated and super easy to drink on a warm day. This was from the second batch in June so there is no “fade” in this bottle.
In closing, what can I say that hasn’t been said before; it’s old reliable, SN, easy to find, the price is always right and they always do a nice job of coming close to the style they’re brewing with their own stamp on it. One bottle left in the second sixer and I do believe I’ll spring for a third with a heatwave coming this week, cheers!"
Popular,Summerfest,3.95,"I've only had this a few times, since I'm usually not drawn to lagers (except pilsners). But it really is a nice go-to beer when you want something simple and don't have much selection to choose from.

Pours with a transparent golden body and white head. Specks of lacing decorate the glass, but it's nothing to write home about. Great can art.

Biscuit, lemon, lime and white pepper notes grace the nose, bringing a slightly funky malt base reminiscent of the kolsch style. Hints of basil and yeasty pizza dough on the finish. Simple, but nice.

Taste is exactly as expected from the aroma. Just enough bitterness to call itself a beer. The hops are quite restrained and the lager yeast and malt shine. Farmy hay notes on the finish.

Smooth and light texture. It could stand to be lighter, but not by much. It still tastes like food to me, which I consider essential.

Really good for the style, appropriate for the weather and widely available. SN always delivers. Cheers!"

S - Grassy spice hop, with just a touch of honey on the nose.

M - Brisk carbonation, light weight, dry close.

O - I pleasant summer drinker, as advertised."
Popular,Summerfest,2.96,"A: Brief bright white, pillowy head that recedes to a thin line; not much retention. Clear yellow straw, perhaps a bit darker.

T: Hay, lemon up front. Does have some bitterness, but in an almost acrid kind of way. Rather unpleasant.
F: Very round and full mouthfeel.
O: Wish I was getting some of the yeastier/breadier notes others have mentioned, but as is, this one is a disappointment."
Popular,Summerfest,3.88,"Super clear gold with one finger head.

Barleycorn and wheats, lil hoppy, faint feet.

Feels pretty good, semi dry/semi sweet. Balanced bitterness and malt fullness.

Pretty good, it’s a beer."
Popular,Summerfest,3.83,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium-golden color with a strong white head that sits quietly for a while. SRM of 6. (4.25)

Aroma: Light aromas of orange citrus, apple, grape. Some bread dough sweetness. The aroma is subdued and subtle, but it has that classic SN orange citrus/nectar aroma. (3.75)

Flavor: Initial flavors of yeast and grainy upfront. Followed by an orchard fruit quality. There's sweet orange & apple juice. A slight bitterness comes through on the end, but the yeast finishes it dry. Again, the classic SN orange citrus/nectar flavor. Even a little bit of pine. (3.75)

Feel: Light, crispy, well-carbonated. Good carbonation and yeast finish it dry with nothing left on the palate. Goes down extremely light. (3.75)

Compared to Alaskan Kolsch 6/14/20: Pours a lighter color. More orange/nectar and apple juice flavors. Less malty sweetness and cherry. Overall, lighter and cleaner.

Compared to Zipline Brewing's Kolsch 7/5/20: Pours a darker color. Stronger fruit and hoppy aromas. Less malty bread. A bit more of a citrus and crispy bite.

Compared to Trader Joe's Josephbra Czech Pilsner 8/14/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More orange dish soap on the aroma. Less bread. Dryer, crisper.

Compared to Oberon 8/23/20: Pours a similar color. More nectarine/apple/bread on the aroma. Less dry orange. Overall, sweeter.

Compared to SN Oktoberfest 2020, 8/23/20: Pours a lighter color. More pale malts and orcharfruit aromas. Less resinous orange/nectar. Slightly more tart and less bready. Overall, these are quite similar. I think we all know who copied whose homework.

Overall: A pretty good summer drink. Not exactly a Czech-style pilsner. Not really in hardly any aspect except slightly bready. It's got more fruit and yeast, with little signs of any noble hops. I actually mislabeled this as a Kolsch. It has more Kolsch orchard fruit flavors. Lots of nectarine/peach/apple. It actually has classic Sierra Nevada orange soap flavors too. Finishes on the dry side, with less malts for a Czech pils and more classic and resinous Sierra Nevada orange pine. (Final Rating: 3.83)

*Compare to a dense Kolsch*"
Popular,Summerfest,4.4,"Look: Light golden in color, clear and a vigorous pour brings on a good head that recedes leaving good lacing
Aroma: Pilsner malt, cut grass, slight lemon notes, and earthy and spicy hops
Taste: Biscuit and cracker-like malt up intermingles with herbal, earthy, and slightly spicy hops in good balance. Finishes very clean and crisp
Mouthfeel: Clean, balanced, and light but not watery. Medium carbonation and a huge depth of flavor but not at all so that it leads to a heavy feel
Overall: Awesome stuff. Crisp, balanced, and full of flavor. This has always been a beer that doesn't fit into typical style boxes IMO - somewhere between a Czech Pilsner, an American Lager, and a Kolsch for my palate. Honestly though, who cares - all I know is it is tasty and a regular occupant of my fridge during its seasonal release."
Popular,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.82,"This beer is way more balanced than your typical IPA. The first note was more malt than hops, which was interesting. Bread and toasted malt. Then the hops. Floral, slightly earthy, a bitnof pine. Balance is the big word here. Super drinkable. A go-to beer for sure."
Popular,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants."
Popular,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,"12/11/14:
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.

Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.

Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.

A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.

Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

What's the paper on the bottle say? ""Rebel IPA is brewed with 5 varieties of West Coast hops: Cascade, Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook & Amarillo, It's everything we love about West Coast-style IPAs, Big citrus & grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful, refreshing brew."""

Starting with the look is good with abit of flatness. Smells great! Hoppy and truly aromatic like an IPA should be. Taste is amazing with abit of bitterness kick towards the end.

Small hint of pine notes with maybe a little flower to it. The taste is very clean & this beer goes down easy, decent amount of hoppy bite to it. I would consider it a session IPA. It's more flat than it is carbonated, very light on the palate. This isn't a world class IPA, nor should it be, I think this is a very approachable IPA & one that could definitely be crushed while grillin or chillin. Anyone looking to get into the world of IPA's could start with this brew!"
Popular,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.83,"16oz can, pint glass, best by June 2020.

Crystal clear goldenrod with a whopper of a head! Two plus fingers of cratering new parchment foam rise and linger, dissipating slowly, becoming more craggy as time advances.

Clean, biting grapefruit rind, a trace of pineapple, some caramel peeking through as this nears it's drink by date, and Cascade floral-ness.

I get a dose of biscuity caramel that's quickly doused by a hit of grapefruit and bitterness. Pine and mango develop and pass into a medium bitter finish that's mostly clean, but sports a little soapy pith. It's really quite a hoppy one.

Medium bodied, though with more viscosity than normal for the style. The carbonation is medium-high and stands up to it.

I come away almost embarrassed that I've always discounted this beer, so much so that I hadn't tried it until this monstrous deal of a case of 16oz cans for $12 landed in my lap. I have my vacation pool beer now. I appreciate Sam's homage to the classic American, almost West Coast, IPA. Even when almost six months old the hops are very present."

L: brilliantly-clear, medium-amber colored liquid... fortunate pour brings tight, crystalline, rocky foam from midway up the bowl of the glass to the lip... chunky, messy head holds like a champ till the bottom; several thick streaks of lace

S: potent hop aromas immediately upon crown removal; in glass: pineapple, grapefruit, maybe a touch of mango... moderately bold, lasting intensity

T: toasty crystal malt and bready pale base jumps out immediately in its foundation, relatively dry, while peppery, spicy-citrusy hops cut over the top... aftertaste has a bit of pine and herbal-grassy bitterness, moderate peppery spice humming along... crystal malt builds in aftertaste as it goes, but the hop static continues to weigh it down

F: clean-cut, dry; delicate residual resinous and boozy streaks left across palate, slow flame builds a little warmth

O: never tried this; have only found old, out-of-code bottles in my hunt for it as of late (discontinued?), so surprised to find one in-code and with some life left in it... it's a classic WC IPA, as billed, with a relatively crackin' execution, if not particularly distinctive in taste... would very much enjoy having one again if it was my best option (1570)"

The aroma has a strong note of lemon sourness with light malts to back it up, not much peach at all

The front of the sip is tart and a little malty, and it turns into a more subtle, dry peach with a doughy aftertaste. A great balance here, though I was expecting a bit more on the peach front

Highly carbonated and easy drinking, a very light refreshing finish

This is an all around great beer, despite the only slight hint of peach flavor, which could be chalked up to freshness, it's just over 17 months old so it may have lost a bit of flavor, and I'd love to try it fresh"

Popular,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.31,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still"
Popular,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.42,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.

Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity."
Popular,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.08,"2018 Vintage

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75

Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25

Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0

Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25

Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75"
Popular,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.75,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time."

Popular,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.62,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass.

2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.

A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

The moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sixpoint can glass

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.

Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness.

Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Overall, a very good beer that I would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,3.91,"12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, hoppy citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,4.09,"Clear amber appearance with a large, off white head and good lacing. Appealing aroma of pine and citrus. Hop flavors are a bit more mellow than anticipated; more floral and herbal. Modest sweetness, but bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,4,Pours a lovely golden bronze color with an off white head. Smell is malt and citrus hops. Taste has floral and orange / grapefruit hops some pine resin and a sweet malt kiss. This is an IPA that is the way it used to be. Bitter hoppy malty.
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,4.71,"Ok folk's !!! I do not do alot of reviews on this site any more due to my general lack of enthusiasm with the hype of the Hazy IPA craze !!! Tropical this, melon that, no malt just hops and yeast and quite frankly it is extremely boring too say the least. There is no such thing as balance anymore. BORING !!!!

This is an old school IPA that is not geared for the hipster IPA scene. It has plenty of hop aroma and flavor that when paired with the selection of rich malts creates an exceptionally balanced brew. Yes I get it !!! Most younger folks will not appreciate this balance but I actually miss this style of an IPA !!! An IPA is supposed to be balanced !!!! Nowday's brewery's can just throw hops in a hop back with a tinge of pale malts and become an overnight success. Zero balance and flavor nuances.

I give this brew two thumb's up because of the overall balance of malt and hops. This is what and IPA should taste like. I am bored to tears with the current IPA offerings from brewery's. No thought or balance just hops. I have zero respect for the brewmasters / breweries."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,4.05,"Pours a sunburst orange with a lighter orange/yellow at the top. Slightly murky tint to it. Head is a finger of snowy white foam with modestly good retention. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, orange, mango, resiny and dank hops. Light bready, earthy malts add a bit of balance and 'boniness' to the back-end of the aroma. It's a pleasant contrast to the initial hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine, mango, resiny, herbal and dank hops with bready, earthy, toasty malts. Balance is great, with the hops out front and sticking to the tongue long after the sip. Mouth feel is lightly sticky with a light graininess to it. It has a medium to medium-thick consistency offering up a 'heavier' presence. Overall, hops are great and are contrasted well by malts; however, the focus remains wholly on the hops.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,3.98,"Appearance: Pours a deep orange, dark peachy color. A white and lacy head. SRM of 13. (3.75)

Aroma: Dank resinous melon, lime, pineapple, and red grape. A touch of vanilla yogurt with berries. (3.75)

Flavor: Lots of lime, red grape and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of lychee and an almost plastic or medicinal quality. Finishes with rich caramel malts, yet a fairly strong bitter finish. A unique flavor, but also reminiscent of some of the first IPAs I've tried. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied, Average carbonation. Lingering bitter pine and pith which is appropriate. Right in line with what an IPA should be. (4.00)

Overall: Definitely a good IPA. Takes the IPA back to it's origins in terms of a hop profile. Reminds me of some of the first IPAs I tried. On par with what a good IPA should be. Nothing extraordinary, but a good rating for being traditional and accurate to it's origins. (Final Rating: 3.98)"
Popular,Hop Nosh IPA,3.87,"Can Date: 6/12/19
Palate Contaminants: none

Color is a medium orange. Slightly murky. Moderate amount of fine head that doesn't hang around so long.

Lots of malt on the nose, but the grain evokes a wheat brew. The sweetness also contributes to a marmalade scent. Light bits of vegetation, specifically cilantro and moss. Overall, it could use some more intensity, though.

Bitterness up front right away, and too much of it. The moss is still there, but the sweetness and anything connected to it is buried. The bitterness even disconnects the malt from any sweetness, which actually makes the whole thing not so cohesive. Not that it's not palatable, there are just so many other good IPAs out there.

Good medium weight, and the carbonation is pretty smooth. Alcohol about par for a sevener. Bitterness just continues in the aftertaste."

Mouthfeel: Full but light, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and clean and crisp on the finish
Overall: A classic and still a winner. I hadn’t had this in some time but need to have it in rotation more often as it’s a Czech Pilsner O.G. that showcases Saaz hops well and hits all the style notes dead-on"

But my review is from a 12 oz can, poured into a ‘Pivovar Cvikov’ pint glass that, ahem, insisted I bring home with me from Bohemian Switzerland.

Fizzy, herbal, elegant bitterness, skunky from the Czech Republic’s native spicy Saaz hops, the soft water profile sets the standard for the style.
It’s an acquired taste for sure, and is a great accompaniment for sausages, sauerkraut, dumplings and goulash.
To just sit and session a few? Nah.,"

There's better Pilsners, but they're not necessarily available. Macro brew doesn't get better than this at least in the style"
Popular,Pilsner Urquell,3.64,"The original Pilsner! It’s good to try these to have that good benchmark for future tasting.

Pours a crystal clear, light golden straw colour with a nice effervescent yet tightly packed, three finger head that slowly recedes over 5 minutes leaving a very circular, spotty cap.

Fairly savoury aroma, interestingly enough. A little bit funky and skunky, mild cheese in the savoury department but without being too musty. Clean aromas for the skunkiness. Gentle floral aromas and clean wheat and breads.

A pleasant bitterness punctuates throughout the flavour profile. Taste follows the nose but it’s a lot cleaner and less funky than the nose suggests. Bready, wheaty, clean floral and grassy on the palate. A little bit sweet with the crisp malt flavours balanced by the grassy, floral hop bitterness.

Crisp mouthfeel with medium carbonation, the large bubbles create a tickling, clean sip. Light bodied with a gentle, subtle but bittersweet finish. Dryish finish.

It’s an interesting beer for sure, better than any typical American lager macro. The skunkiness/savoury notes certainly add a unique aspect to this drink. At the price point it’s never a bad option and it’s great on tap. Glad I could revisit this as I begin to drink craft again, always good to go back to the basics/classics so you can remember the benchmarks for each style."

S - Floral. Biscuit. White bread. Not too much else, but it's nice.
T - Wow! Starts off simple; floral and grassy. Evolves into a more chewy bread note, then into a bitter hop bite. Nice and bittersweet at first, and finishes bitter.
F - Crisp. Clean. Easy-to-drink. Not filling in the slightest.
O - The de-facto pilsner. Well-balanced, complex enough, and rounded. Though it's not the best, it sets the bar for what a pilsner should be! I definitely recommend it, but don't kill yourself looking for it."
Popular,Pilsner Urquell,3.5,"It's good! But a bit overrated. It's a nice pilsner which is easy to drink and fairly balanced, the little bit of sweetness weights up the bitterness from the hops in a good way without becoming too sweet. Has a nice carbonation, served here in a 50 cl can.

But it is something out of the ordinary? Nah, not really. It's good, but it's not something you go ""woooow"" over.
Perfect beer though if you want an easy-going ice cold beer to relax with in the summer or together with a bite to eat, imo.

I buy it from time to time, which means I like it enough to come back to it. So I say try it, especially if you like stanard lagers/pilsners. There are a lot of worse lagers out there for sure."

Holy shit, I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby, and I wasn’t even actively looking. My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper. I got a few cans of each (HT is ready for a re-review, and I couldn’t be more psyched on it. Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed

While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed

Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The Alchemist"
Popular,Focal Banger,4.96,"Would argue that this is in fact better than Heady Topper. The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more. Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin, Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops."
Popular,Focal Banger,4.55,"Look: Pale yellow and cloudy with a quick-forming head that settles to a lid and holds, leaving nice ripples of lacing clinging to the edges of the glass
Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis
Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish
Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agree"
Popular,Focal Banger,4.84,"My buddy bought me a four pack each of HT And Focal Banger. This was by far my favorite.

Pours a murky gold color with a beautiful fluffy white marshmallow head. Tremendous lacing.

The aroma is pure hop goodness. The flavor and taste on this one is out of this world outstanding. Peach and pine and grapefruit with no sweetness. A true west coast IPA.

Outside of Pliny this is my fave IPA in the world. Fantastic! Thanks Harris!!"
Popular,Focal Banger,4.28,"16oz can

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.

Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.

The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.

Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.

Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.

Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.

Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful."

New England IPA
ABV: 7%
Date: 05/03/2022
I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average.
Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty.
The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy.
The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long.
An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge."
Popular,Focal Banger,4.34,"Heady Topper's little brother!!! Less alcohol presence but just as impressive!!! Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!"

It might not beat my favored winter beers at higher ABV than this, but I have thoroughly enjoyed the handful of beers I’ve tried from New Belgium Brewing Co.

Moderate malts, a hint of chocolate again, also a hint of prunes and liquorice, very mild spices."
Popular,1554,3.58,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour it's dark but not black indoor lighting reveals a dark brown that let's a small amount of light through, held up to light it's a dark reddish brown with no haze. Less than one finger head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass.

Aroma is definitely influenced by licorice but very subtly and it blends into the dark malt sweetness quite well. The new Belgium website says there is in fact some nugget hops but they aren't very present in the aroma. Beyond the licorice it's similar to a belgian trippel/Dunkel in aroma if you were to combine the two traditional styles.

Taste is quite dry and yeasty but with some chocolate roasty malt notes. Some herbal bitterness but this beer is quite easy to drink and not the heaviest in flavor. I'd say this is pretty similar to the Baltic porter style. Lagery porter like beer but they don't call it either of those things. Some bitterness does creep up as you drink, dissimilar to hops, that seem to get less bitter as you drink. Definitely a dark malty beer

Feel is creamy but drinkable. Similar to a Baltic porter once again. Not light but not too heavy either. Big beer relative to a lot of what's out there but smaller than the trippel by these guys.

Overall an interesting beer that's not super traditional to any style it seems other than dark lager inspired by a mideavil beer recipe. It's good, not necessarily something that's sticking out to me though."

Popular,1554,4.31,"Great appearance
Caramel and malt flavor with chocolate
Mouthfeel was nothing like I expected, instead it was very drinkable and crisp for such a dark lager
Light finish that leaves you wanting more"
Popular,1554,3.78,"I actually like this a good bit based on one bottle, body is good even with no glass and out of the bottle, does have lager vibes but it seems like it needs to be a smidge warmer like other dark brews to be enjoyed. Relatively impressed and glad cuz for some reason I don't have a great liking for a lot of their beer"
Popular,1554,4.09,"(12 oz bottle, 68799 06MAR22; purchased single off shelf at Total Wine, Tucson... poured into a stemless wine glass)

L: clear, ruby-garnet liquid; fleeting, flimsy, tanned khaki-colored foam... about what one would expect from a non-bottle condition rendering of this derivative style... keeps a thin yet tight collar; little lacing

S: old upholstery, dry port, desiccating plum, hint of red cough medicine... overall weak(ened) intensity but inviting expression

T: up front: curiously roasty, oxidized dark sherry overtones; bit of a prune color to its dry aftertaste.... second sip reveals more depth: fruitcake, berry jelly, hints of toasty dark crystal malt... ehhh, I could see a justifiable (doppel)bock comparison... overall: dry, malty, mulled wine

F: velvety carbonation softening the edges of its whispery-plush body; calm caress of residual warmth... maybe this is a lager... too suave

O: low-key high quality, but I'll take Ommegang Abbey Ale any day over this... this was the last of 4 consecutive reviews this morning of brands I can't readily procure out east... I love the 'Euro dark lager' label for this, because it's sort of appropriate, despite this being an undeniably familiar relic of early craft beer Dubbel knock-offs... as a 'lager', it's great, but c'mon, don't corrupt my to-style ratings bro; their zwert story is romantically compelling but bs - doesn't result in a distinctive brew... arguably slightly higher marks than it deserves (bland, rough edges), but I'd have this again (1849)"
Popular,1554,4.03,"Look: Dark brown to black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light with a short-lasting head that settles to a film and leaves good lacing behind
Aroma: Warm brown bread, light chocolate notes, wafts of licorice, a little toffee, and mild earthy notes
Taste: Rich bready malt, toffee, and chocolate are the initial notes and after they settle, some nice light licorice appears along with some earthiness. The flavors all meld well before brown bread and chocolate take hold and close it out
Mouthfeel: Full but light, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and clean finish
Overall: I dig it. I love these folks’ Belgian offerings so scoring this as part of their mix 12-pack was a fun and tasty chance to revisit. The licorice notes make it unique tasting and smelling and they work well here in my opinion plus help set this apart from other Euro Dark Lagers (which although this is an ale, feels/tastes like a lager). Unique, well-made, and tasty"
Popular,1554,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. The appearance of the beer resembles a sort of cola/mahogany color, with more than a finger's worth of fluffy tan head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: very malty, and rich notes of coffee and chocolate/cocoa. Other notes of toffee, subtle vanilla, licorice, spices, cherries, raisins, bread crust, yeast, and cinnamon.

Really tasting dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee on the palette, along with the spices, licorice, and subtle vanilla most especially. Essentially follows the aroma. Body is medium-light."
Popular,1554,4.03,"Appearance is black, not quite pitch black; ruby red/dark brown highlights. The tan head is absurdly creamy and thick for what appeared to be low carbonation initially. Long-lasting retention and sheets of lacing.

On the nose I get lots of chocolate, a little bit of coffee and vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon or some vague spice note.

Chocolate dominates the palate, hitting upfront with hints of vanilla, dark brown bread in the middle, a touch of plum and balsamic vinegar, and maybe just a vague hint of generic spice. Finishes quick dry with a dusting more of cocoa powder, before finishing more abruptly than expected into cleanness.

The mouthfeel is medium, moderately carbonated, well carbonated and slightly pillow. Finishes crisper and lighter than expected, given the chewiness of the mid-palate.

...Overall, well a solid beer. I had to know idea what style of this beer was going in. I thought it was a Belgian dark ale and reviewed it as such! Surprise, surprise...well, it's pretty solid for a Euro black lager!"

The bear is creamy and soft, almost the consistency of a melted milkshake. This is an outstanding beer! Nice job New Belgium!!"
Popular,1554,4.16,"Purchased as a 12-bottle variety pack from Sam's Club for $15.90. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Dark, molasses brown with a barely one-finger coffee brown head. Laces well.
S - Raisin, cacao, and dark breads. Slight ethanol.
T - Dark chocolate and stone fruit, washed over by pumpernickel and caramel. Light licorice and toffee finish. Not bitter in the slightest.
F - Sticky. Silky. Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Definitely on the heavier side.
O - A fantastic beer on its own, but even better when paired with steak! Great for a colder night. Couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, I'm afraid. Would highly recommend trying at least once. Will purchase again if I see it."
Popular,Nelson,4.04,"Can with unreadable date. GL Tulip.

A: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. No visible carbonation; it’s too hazy.

S: from a foot away I can smell the sweet, tropical fruitiness. Like papaya and gooseberries in syrup.

T: on first arrival, hop burn; tangy, tart, tropical, citric, floral, ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness that I actually find unpleasant. I think it’s the rye. I love rye whiskey, but I can’t think of a single rye beer I’ve liked - including this one. The hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant, as does the weird rye finish.

M: lighter side of medium, pillow-soft.

O: I saw this on the shelf ten years ago, and wanted to buy it but passed it up. I didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago, and that’s post AB acquisition. I wasn’t willing to get a six, but I saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. When this beer came out, ten years ago, it was revolutionary. Not so much today. Its beautiful to look at and smell, and is still a great example of the hazy IPA style, but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. At least it’s got a good name."
Popular,Nelson,4.37,"Nice golden hue and minimal head.
Earthy and floral notes.
Malty backbone, bitterness is on point here.
Good carbonation, nice balance.chewy.
I can't find flaws, great drinking beer."
Popular,Nelson,3.62,"Picked up a six pack of cans based on the rating. Best by date of 08/13/22.

Pours a clear, golden orange with hints of amber and a lovely half inch of frothy head. Carbonation looks slightly below average. A good amount of lacing as you drink, some slides and some clings. Looks as expected.

Interesting, the aroma is overall a bit sour -- wasn't expecting that. Grape, stone fruit, cantaloupe, some pine and a bit of funky earthiness and spice. Malts are lingering in the background with a light toastiness. Not sure I will like this based on the aroma, but here we go.

Has a kind of ""green"" flavor. Overall a bit sour, just like the aroma hinted. Spicy and piney hops mixed with stone fruit, cantaloupe, grape... not getting a lot of citrus or tropical fruitiness, perhaps some mango. The malts just kinda chill in the background, lending some toastiness, and maybe some of that sourness as well. Finishes pretty crisp and dry with lingering grape and grapefruit bitterness. Also getting a hint of wood near the swallow and into the finish. Well, this is certainly complex but comes off a bit like a hoppy wine... interesting.

An excellent mouthfeel. Medium bodied with average but zesty carbonation and a good amount of body/chewiness. Drinks very smooth.

I can see why this is highly rated, there is a lot of complexity in the flavor profile and it's quite unique. I can't think of another IPA I've had that tastes like this. That said, I don't really care for it. I'm going to struggle through the rest of this six pack and probably will not seek this one out again."

Popular,Nelson,4.25,"12 oz can (“PKGD 01/10/22”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Hazy amber gold with a thick, rocky head of white foam and streaky lace. Layered aromas of orange citrus, pine, stone and tropical fruit. More fruit follows in the taste with orange citrus, melon and tropical fruit, slight rye spice, pine resin and dank notes. Finishes crisp, bitter and dry. Medium body, smooth feel and moderate carbonation. Densely flavorful with plenty of unique hop character."
Popular,Nelson,4.48,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (100%), pale yellow color with a large, white head. SRM of 6. One of the haziest and most opaque beers I have seen. (4.50)

Aroma: Absolutely giant aromas of mandarin orange, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, citrus, and more tropical fruit. Green Cantaloupe Melon. Even some cinnamon spice. A bit of herbal qualities underneath. Extremely juicy and green. Huge green citrus and tropical banana.

Flavor: A giant bomb of biting mandarin orange citrus, marmalade, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, green mango, gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon altogether. Extremely green and juicy citrus with pine underneath. Finishes sweet and juicy. The green fruit is showcased here mostly in a Citra format, however some gooseberry and grape underneath, but less than I expected.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Sweet and biting. Leaves a green juiciness on the palate that is palate-wrecking.

Compared to Lagunitas Stereohopsis Volume 1, 1/3/21: Pours a lighter and much hazier color. Stronger and juicier aromas. Much more fruity and hazier. The Nelson evolves into more of a green citrus rather than green orchard fruit. More citrus, less orchard-fruit. Overall, quite a similar flavor from the Nelson which is interesting. Finishes much juicier, sweeter, but possibly a lighter body.

Compared to Toppling Goliath Pseudo Sue 1/2/22: Pours slightly hazier. Milder aromas. More mandarin orange, marmalade, and cantaloupe. Less lemon citrus and citrus flower.

Compared to Surly's Axe Man IPA 2/6/22: Pours a lighter and hazier color. Milder aromas. More gooseberry, grape, and deep and resinous tropical and berry notes. Less citrus peel, pineapple, pine, flower, and flavor complexity.

Compared to Stone Deliciousness IPA 3/4/22: Pours a hazier and lighter color. Stronger aromas. More grapefruit, sweet lemon, yellow, and green plastic flavors. Less grapefruit citrus, tangerine, and pine. Slightly less bitter. More grape flavor

Overall: What a giant and juicy IPA. Fantastic mandarin orange, pulp, green gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon flavors. Even some slight cinnamon spice. You could brush your teeth with this beer. Palate cleansing and green. The Nelson doesn't provide the green grape/gooseberry/orchardfruit I was expecting and leans more citrus. Almost like the Citra hop. Actually tastes quite similar to Toppling Goliath's PseudoSue. Would be worth a comparison to PseudoSue, Axe Man, or KIng Sue if I manage to pick this one up again. So dense, so juicy, and so good. (Final Rating: 4.48)"
Popular,Nelson,4.45,"Pours a hazy orange into a paper hotel coffee cup with a big 3"" head, excellent retention and lacing despite the vessel. Nose is tropical juice at first before turning into floral honey and pine as it warms; a hint of malt, grain, and maybe some diesel (though might be the cup). Taste is nicely balanced between sweet, juicer hop elements and a lingering bitterness on the finish. Super smooth on the palate with no hint of alcohol. Glad to finally give it a try."
Popular,Nelson,3.82,"Canned 3/10/21. Consumed from a tulip glass 8/6/21. I would have liked to have tried a fresher version, but smell and taste were both examples of the Nelson hop. Disappointing Look: very small head that was very short lived and there were solids in the beer. It was hazier than I expected. Quite hoppy. My ratings here are somewhat generous and take into account the possible effect of canning date vs. consumption date. With all the great IPAs out there I did not feel that this was a stellar example worth repeating. I was very surprised to see a 98 pt rating."
Popular,Nelson,4.85,"It smells like fresh pine and a little dank. Then the more I smell it i get some breadwater sweetness but the piny hops are the predominant scent.

Oh yeah, now I get the hype. The taste is so clean. First it's barely sweet with a hint of pine and then it's a really bright piny hoppiness.

It's not quite as thin as most IPAs with a medium body.  The finish is bitter and then dank. It lasts for a long time.

Overall it is one of the better IPAs I've had.  It's smooth, balanced and incredibly refreshing. I give this one a really great 5.7 out of 6."
Popular,Nelson,4.24,"Look is opaque orange and more hazy than you would think. Nice one finger of white head with decent retention. Smell is white white and cedar with notes of tropical fruits.

This beer is outstanding and worth its reputation"

Pours an opaque orangish yellow with about two and a half fingers of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Smells of oranges, faint grapes, pineapple and pine.

Taste...Getting a white wine vibe along with slight citrus acidity (not off-putting). Oranges and grapefruit in the background.

Soft, smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste.

Overall, a really decent beer with an interesting taste."
Popular,Nelson,4.19,"It pours a golden straw color with a nice sized head.
There are aromas of rye and tropical fruit.
I’m not usually a fan of Rye IPAs. But this one is very nice The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor.
It has a nice body and mouthfeel.
Leaves a nice aftertaste. The rye works well with the bitterness.


Overall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch."
Popular,Nelson,4.57,"Pours well out of a can, head looks good, foam clings to glass, etc. Very hazy with some larger particulates floating around.

White wine-like characteristics of the hop prominent in smell, along with some mango/tropical fruit.

The most prominent flavor is ripe mango both in flavor profile and sweetness. Not getting much else but mango is awesome so that's a plus.

Robust feel but still dangerously smooth and easy to put down, even at 7%.

Would buy on sight, wife--approved and she hates IPAs."

The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness."
Popular,Raison D'Être,4.03,"Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes."

Popular,Titan IPA,2.01,"Poured from a can into tulip glass a huge 3F mid tan foamy head forms that settles quickly with loose lace from the top to bottom. Color is a coppery dull amber and is about 70% transparent.

The nose presents a nose that is vegetal as in produce department variety, with just a bit of an off note that I can only describe as veg decay, bong water or over fermented mash. It hints that I am going to be hit with a somewhat dank malty hop bomb.

Big slightly toasted malty mash on the palate with a dry danky bitterness. It starts lightly sweet and smooth on the tongue with a fairly strong toasted grain vibe and ends with lightly dry finish with a danky bitterness. This dank is nowhere as near offputting as the nose.

Mouthfeel is medium with a round slickness and warmth to the taste. Carbonation is light and bubbles are fine. Some alcohol tang on the end .

Wow, what an odd beer. The nose really is doing me in, some bong water mixed with beer is what I get. Not good. Taste is another matter as it is decent yet I cannot enjoy it because you have to breath. Maybe I got a bad can but it is still less than 2 months old. Perhaps it is the type of hops used that turn it a bit too dank for me."

It pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head - again 5 years old...so my fault on the head.
Amazing nose with chocolate, cinnamon spice and vanilla - perhaps a hint of roasty coffee - but the spice notes are just right.
Taste is smooth with chocolate note, vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice, yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness.
Despite the limited head, this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel. Hopefully Stone (Sapporo) sends some fresh stuff north to Canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here...."
Popular,Xocoveza,5,"This is my first sample. I'm wary of stouts made with lactose, because while I have had a couple of good ones -- Espressway and Two Die 4 by Two Roads -- I've had sickeningly sweet examples such as Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing and Brig from Springdale.

In any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice.

It is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.

The palate stuns me. Beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. The spice component is perfect; it is not overdone.

The beer's high ABV is utterly hidden.

I have nothing but praise for this stout. It is the best beer from Stone I've ever had. It is perfect."

Was skeptical at first. By the end of the six pack, I was a believer. Went back to pick up another six pack a week and a half later, gone."
Popular,Xocoveza,4.77,"Pouring this nearly black can of awesomeness into a pint glass produced a 1"" tan head that had excellent retention and lacing. This beer looks just wonderful.

Aroma was complex. At cellar temperature: Mexican chocolate, peppers, vanilla, faint cinnamon. It was like smelling an aromatic puzzle where all the pieces fit together perfectly.

Taste: Just wow. Taste follows the nose. This is just the right level of sweetness for a holiday stout. The peppers and cinnamon provide just a touch of lingering heat, and the chocolate gives you a bit of unsweetened bitterness. This is really a wonderful beer - strong competition for Prairie's Christmas Bomb.

Mouthfeel toes the line between medium and full bodied, which is a perfect compliment to the flavor profile. This is just thick enough for the big, bold flavors, but also incredibly smooth.

Overall: I am filled with regret that I only bought a single. This will be a six pack next year. Just....wow."
Popular,Xocoveza,4.49,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. Canned on 9/16/20, so this exactly 3 months old. I only cooled this in the fridge for a short time, and I gave it some time to come closer to room temperature for a while before opening. Seems to be the right temperature - just cool but not cold. Could even probably drink this at cellar temperature and it would be good.

Look: Pours almost pitch black with light brown highlights. Has a very nice looking fluffy brown head. The head dissipated slowly; a very thin head is lingering. Tiny bubbles are slowly rising to the surface.

Smell: This has a very nice, complex aroma. The first things that I get are coffee, cocoa powder, fruity chili pepper, and roasty toasty malts. The back end has cinnamon and nutmeg. Hard to pick up the vanilla on the nose, but it could easily be blending in with the chocolate and other aromas. After drinking, I can pick up on a vanilla cream note in the nose on the front end that is reminiscent of cream soda, very nice. Gives some nutty roasted almond notes too that are quite nice. A mild earthy hop aroma and acidity on the finish as well. This smells like Mexican hot chocolate and it smells delicious!

Taste: Wow, this is a lot sweeter than I expected. It at least has a perceived sweetness initially. It's very smooth and drinkable. This is a dangerous beer at 8.1% ABV. The flavors in this beer meld together very nicely; to me they are more discernible on the nose than in the mouth. Up front, you get spiced coffee/hot chocolate notes and sweetness that quickly transition to a roasty, slightly bitter finish with a lingering spicy chili pepper. The finish has really nice unsweetened chocolate notes, along with some fruitiness from the chocolate and pasilla pepper. The finish has a lot of sweetness also; you can tell your brain what you want to focus on - bitter or sweet. I get a lot of spiced nut notes on the finish as well.

Feel: Mouthfeel is really nice - on the thicker side of medium body. Slightly chewy and pefectly carbonated for this type of beer.

Overall: A really delicious adjunct stout. Is this a pastry stout? I have heard so much about pastry stouts, but I don't actually know how to characterize one and whether this is in or out. Regardless, it's a very delicious beer. With all the specialty ingredients that they put in, you sure hope that it would come out delicious but they could have easily messed up such a complicated recipe. Kudos to Stone for finding the right balance to express all of these flavors without overpowering the beer.

Note: Lactose added."

Popular,Leffe Blonde,3.81,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a goblet. Looks dark golden, almost amber color with a creamy white head that fell to a cap. Some lacing coats the glass as I drink. Smell is spice, clove, cinnamon, banana bread. Taste starts sweet and spicy with banana and clove dominating. Middle sees a bit of candied fruit and then a dose of hops brings some bitterness to the front. Finish is candi sugar and spice. Aftertaste is subdued. Feel is light bodied, prickly carbonation, and a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall, not a style I seek out, but this is a good beer that's interesting to drink."
Popular,Leffe Blonde,3.75,"Bought a 6-pacl 11.2oz bottles $11.99 Whole Foods
238 days before best by date
Clear dark golden color
Smell of spices like coriander, cloves
Medium mouthfeel
High carbonation
Tastes of bananas, cloves, coriander, tastes are lighter than other Belgian beers
Overall a good beer for the price. Most Belgian beers are $5-$9 for a single bottle so while this is not as good as those, at $2/bottle this is a good deal."
Popular,Leffe Blonde,4.83,"Look: This pours deep yellow and clear with three fingers of head that could easily be more, regular bubbling, very attractive ber.

Aroma: Bread, bananas, sweet, yeast, and a hint of cloves.
Taste: Vanilla, Banana, Caramel, Cloves, and even a hint of cinnamon, extremely smooth ending in a light hoppy bitterness.

Feel: Syrupy and highly carbonated. Will additionally fizz if you swish it around in your mouth. Quite a full mouthfeel.

Overall: An excellent and very high quality Blonde Ale, probably the best beer I've tasted in this class."
Popular,Leffe Blonde,4.23,"Look: Pours a light orange shade of brass with a one finger, finely compacted head of white foam. Great lacing and head retention.

Aroma: Bananas foster, bubblegum, slightly spicy notes of clove and vanilla bean.

Feel: Full bodied. Full carbonation.

Overall: A phenomenal Belgian blonde ale. Just an overall excellent taste, aroma and mouthfeel. Very pleasant to drink."
Popular,Leffe Blonde,3.26,"purchased from the neighborhood drug store. Poured over ice fresh from the bottle. Pours a straw golden yellow, smells of malted bananas. Frothy mouth feel, a decent amount of fizz. It reminds me of sitting in the garden all day and talking about the end of world while titrating amphetamine salts and discussing how the government controls the weather. Its a beer you find open but mostly full on the deck the next the next morning while cleaning up and decide to skull it anyway. Is it a good example of the style no, is it a little different and you know what it will be with no surprises, yes."
Popular,Leffe Blonde,1.36,"Looks fancy. Costs fancy. Tastes like rotten Budweiser. But costs 4 times as much. 0/10 would not buy again, especially when there are so many vastly superior options."

I would like this with fondue."

Faint banana aroma. This is no bubblegum bomb. Taste is light banana with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel on the light side.
This is a decent session beer for a Belgian ale with 6.6% ABV."

Clear and puffy white head. Smell is sweet cereal malt and clove. Very, overly sweet and slick feeling. This is probably the best thing InBev makes (even if they do this on the sly)

It is just okay for a Belgian ale, but sometime this is all you can find"
Popular,Leffe Blonde,3.65,"Appearance: Clear gold, good head.

Smell: Skunk at first, then cloves and phenol-y yeast.

Taste: Bubblegum sweetness throughout with some cloves and phenolic yeast notes in the finish.

Overall: Decided to try this after seeing it a fair amount on the WBAYDN? Thread. I don't usually go for the Belgian pale ales, but this was enjoyable. I liked the bubblegum note and the yeast notes were complementary instead of distracting. Now I'll have to try their brown ale."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.62,"draught (nitro)
IBU: 69
Velvety, tan head. Thick and bold, black looking elixir. Soft, dark and caramelized, roasted grains, for the aroma. Slightly watered down, dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is OK."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4.69,"This beer is really good. Beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. First sip and you already taste the chocolate. This isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout, this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. Probably higher on the calories so probably only have one, but if you get the chance to try it, do it."

Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.53,On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black body with a nice creamy khaki head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malt. Tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. Milk chocolate without the milk. Roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. Medium body and very drinkable. Low carbonation. Hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.94,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Black colour, huge brown head. Sweetish aroma with strong notes of chocolate / cocoa, also notes of vanilla. Silky mouthfeel. The flavour is moderately sweet, again with dominant notes of chocolate / cocoa and vanilla, but also a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Not bad at all."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.84,"Notes from 2011. Had this on draft.
A: pours dark brown, blackish body with small, tan head with ok retention and lacing
S: smells like sweet, cocoa, dark chocolate; smells like a sweet chocolate bar
T: bittersweet, like bakers chocolate taste; subtle alcohol notes; somewhat robitussiny; ok overall
M: pretty smooth and solid
D: nice mouthfeel and taste combo; good overall; a bit medicinal"
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4.5,"A: Pours a nice rocky head. The head looks like chocolate milk so great start so far. Color is almost completely opaque. The little light that filters through shows a dark brown.

S: Smells of luscious chocolate. A good amount of sweetness, almost like frosting. Nice nuttiness and the malt character really comes through.

T: The cocoa is so present, but never seems to take center stage. The milky creaminess starts and is just so mellow. The roasted malts and the bitterness builds beautifully until the hop spice pops the bubble and clears the pallet. It finishes with a long drawn out chocolate aftertaste. The hops are a bit distracting and I honestly wished there was a lot less hops. It balances the drink and cleanses the palate, but I never feel like I get to fully bathe in the richness before being snapped out of it.

O: This is the adult version of a chocolate milk. So smooth, so drinkable. A clear flaw that changes this drink from indulgent to simply great."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.65,"Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark pour... nearly black with big foamy mocha head. Great lacing.

S: Smells fantastic... big roast and milk chocolate.

T.F: Bittersweet roasted malts. Chocolate is present but not nearly as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe... kind of syrupy. Mild coffee... a bit of hop bittering and pine to boot. Lighter bodied than it should be. Fairly smooth. More bittersweet processed cocoa at the finish.

O: This was decidedly average... and nowhere near as good as the rating would have you believe. Looks good. Smells good. Taste... meh. There are WAY better chocolate stouts out there."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.3,"Disappointing. Smells and looks good, but the chocolate flavoring tastes like the chocolate syrup served at a buffet. I’ll skip this the next time I see it."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4.35,"Great chocolate stout! i agree, balance between bitter/sweet is off to my palete, leans more bitter for style... not sure if it's Hopping or to much roasted malts.. i think overly hopped! but damn tasty. brown to tan head that lingers awhile, nice aroma, good chocolate in taste, medium mouth feel. carbonation right on! great, could be tweaked to super great! I've turned many people towards dark beer with this one! 50/50 men, women! their dubbel chocolate... an easy 5!"
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4.28,"Beautiful very dark brown/black appearance. Nice tan head that stays thought drinking it also has great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, slight smoke, and roasted malt. The taste is as described heavy chocolate taste upfront then the roasted malts and oats come through gets quite bitter on the finish. Too bitter in my opinion could do a better job of balancing the sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy, medium bodied and quite dry on the finish, nice amount of carbanation."
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4,Bomber from Albertsons. Near black pour with small creamy beige head. Rich dark chocolate aroma. Taste adds light bitter roast to the chocolate. Velvety feel.
Popular,Chocolate Stout,4.03,The pour is jet black with a tan & frothy head. The aroma is of dark chocolate & roasted malts & the taste follows suit. If you're looking for stout with chocolate added to it then look no further because this beer delivers. There is a date on the front of the bottle. I like chocolate stouts but i'm more of a coffee stout drinkers so this beer I would not care to revisit. Cheers! A-
Popular,Chocolate Stout,3.98,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a slight mahogany tint and a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick lacing.

S: Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder, bittersweet, and milk, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a little char, a touch of smoke, earthy, slightly piney, toffee sweetness, and a hint of dark fruit.

T: Roasty, big bittersweet and milk chocolate, a little vanilla, some char and faint smoke, earthy piney bitterness, toffee sweetness, and a touch of dark fruit on the back end, mostly cherry and plum.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy.

O: Definitely lives up to the name, super chocolate-y. My main gripe is how assertive the bitterness is. I feel like if they backed it down 10+ IBU it would be even better."

Popular,Gulden Draak,4.19,"To me, this brand has always been synonymous with excellence and authenticity. They seem to always have that Belgian yeast taste and beautiful balance. This is no exception, but as worth the others I've reviewed, it is exceptional.

It pours deep reddish brown with plenty of foam. Gorgeous. The aroma says Belgium. There taste is that malty darkness with yeasty astringent overtones. The experience is always a treat.

Highly recommended. When you need to break out of any kind of funk, this will do it."
Popular,Gulden Draak,4.19,"Huge foamy head with a hazy rusty brown body. Smell is lighter than expected; bubblegum, banana, plenty of esters, bread dough, and a hint of coriander.

Not disappointed."

Popular,Gulden Draak,4.69,"Poured into snifter. Ruby brown, a good khaki cream head that abates to a persistent but thin ring and a big blotch of lace.

Nose is dark fruits and malt.

Taste is the same, very malty sweet, some banana notes with the dark fruits. Delightful.

Feel is crazy smooth especially with that ABV.

Years ago, this was my first fancy Belgian ale. It's still great."
Popular,Gulden Draak,4.25,"Beautiful beer. Lovely clear red amber, with a big, tan, pillowy, three finger, Belgian head. The aroma is dominated by cherry, caramel, and red wine, with a hint of ethanol. The taste is a symphony of fkavour: berries, caramel, red wine, brown sugar, and noticeable but very well balanced alcohol. This is by far the smoothest and most agreeable 10.5% I've ever had. This is great stuff, and widely available, so get some and enjoy it. If someone wanted to know what Belgian beer is like, I would give him one of these as the archetypal Belgian."

If I hadn't been able to see this beer, I probably wouldn't have liked it so much. But even then it's better than average.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent."

Nearly clear, medium dark orange, with the slightest auburn tint. Nice, allspice tinged, medium dark toast caramel malt, with a bit of fruitiness, to the aroma. Some sharpness upfront, lightly astringent, bit of allspice/coriander type sweet spice in the background, with a bit of a floral note to the taste and finish."
Popular,G'Knight,4.25,"Appearance - The beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head.

Smell - The smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style.

Taste - The malts backbone was huge, leaving a trail of sweetness. The dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. Nothing was overpowering, and a dry finish left me thirsty for more.

Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the aftertaste to linger.

Overall - It has been too long since I had this one."
Popular,G'Knight,3.12,"Too hoppy for my taste.
Otherwise a very solid beer for the style, but not red.

F: Full bodied with slick mouthfeel.
O: A decent Autumnal red ale that also delivers a boozy hit. Not very subtle, however."

It is the highest-ranked beer on this site that I have consumed to date, rated #3 in the Red Ale - Imperial style and #3,096 overall at time of writing.

L: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0

T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75

F: Not very easy or enjoyable to drink. 3.0

O: Not for me. 3.0"
Popular,G'Knight,3.92,"Yet another great Oskar offering! Beautiful to behold, with deeper colors at the top of the glass. I guess just because the top is wider? Anyway, a cool effect
Maybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content, but great mouthfeel."
Popular,G'Knight,4,"Nice foamy head. Reddish brown body. Smell is pine resin, pineapple, mango, and spice. Taste is bold- piney hops and mango dominate. Caramel malt and maybe even cinnamon come out in the body, but take a back seat to the hops. That being said, the bitterness is well balanced by malt sweetness. Feel is wet, and a lovely warmth is produced by the ABV. It’s a really good beer, and a great take on red ales. My only critique is that the malt character could be a bit more present."
Popular,G'Knight,4.46,"Delicious imperial red ale. Malty with spicy hops and a long dry finish. Flavors are pronounced and stick around a good long time. Chewy, caramel, lemon, vanilla, herbal spice. Lots going on. A powerhouse of flavor and texture. Very excellent brew to be savored."

Popular,G'Knight,3.62,"I 10000% need to have this more than once to get a better opinion, I definitely don't not like this, idk if ill come back to it once I get a better feel for its taste but this is definitely seems complex. Finkel and garf has a red ipa, which as I understand should be more malt driven, and I understand what they meant. This seems different, perhaps more hoppy, I think the alcohol is covered well, not like a lot of weldwerks doubles were I taste the alcohol. Its not that the malt isn't there....I need to have this again. It's good."

L: drinking from the can, and the can is cool.

Popular,G'Knight,4.25,"A real beauty to look at; the reddish amber body is topped it a large khaki colored head that left plenty of lacing. Laid back aroma features an array of hops, pine being the most prominent, although there is some caramel lurking in the background. Hops continue to dominate the taste. Pine is still present but joined by herbal, floral notes. Tongues a-tingling heading to the aftertaste where that caramel sweetness makes another brief appearance. Noticing a bit of grapefruit as well. Lingering well carbonated finish."
Popular,G'Knight,4.31,"Appearance: Deep copper color, about two fingers of foam.
Smell: Hoppy. Some type of candied fruit. Grapefruit.
Taste: Sweet and bitter. Puckery. I don't think I can pin down any one flavor. Grapefruit rind comes to mind. Maybe some simple syrup. Maybe some sugar cookie. Everything just kind of blends together.
Feel: Silky. Oily.
Taste: Yeah that's some good shit."
Popular,G'Knight,2.63,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a massive 3F mid tan foamy head sits atop a medium amber beer about 40% transparent. Lace starts at the top and slides down the glass as the head slowly sinks over several minutes.

On the nose I get sweaty salty hops predominantly with hints of yeast and mash and some mystery note.

Taste is caramel malt at first then bitter hop and a boozy finish. The unidentified note is a pine resin hops trying to hide the alcohol astringency. A hint of thymol makes this a bit too booze like for me.

Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation that acts as a catalyst to the thymol, piney alcohol and creates a tingly aftertaste. This takes away from the initial malt notes and finishes slick and sticky.

This beer has just too much alcohol and bitterness for me. Parts of the flavor profile hint at schnapps in a beer boilermaker. The Listerine aftertaste is a major turnoff for me. Struggling to get through the rest of the glass, yup drain pour."
Popular,G'Knight,4.34,"LOOK - quite hazy - deep orange/slight copper - nice soapy foam - great head retention - foam clings to the glass

Popular,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.35,"Translucent deep brownish-red, with light, quickly-dissipating tan head.

Smell? Think red wine vinegar, softened by (dried, then moistened) cherry, oak and a touch of vanilla. I say ""vinegar"", but it's softer, more rounded than that, and not as strong. A partner of the other elements, not dominating them.

Taste is is dried cherry, a touch of raisin, the aforementioned red wine vinegar, some oak tannin, and a hint of booze-soaked vanilla.

Feel is smooth/slick - it looks at ""lightly syrupy"", but doesn't actually go there - , light-medium, with light, very,very,very fine carbonation tingle. Some acetic mucilaginous feel at the back of the palate, eventually with a slight drying effect in the front.

Overall, just wonderful. I've had this before, but not in a long, long time. I need to not wait so long for the next time. It lives up to billing, and deserves its high ranking. :)"

T - Dark stone fruit, some ever so slight vanilla, a bit of late harvest grape, as the offering warms, the earthy elements pop. Grainy malts, with earthy musty threads. This is very complex
M - Medium body, semi sweet, then a shift towars slightly sour. Texture is luxurious, slick with a slightly tart linger.
Very cordial like with the gentle carbonation.
O - A bit of a revelation in 11.2 oz's. Outstanding texture, Softened by oak, the acididty doesn't run wild. The tannin touch is deft. Overall exceptional"
Popular,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.49,"More brown than red, slightly hazy, one finger of khaki head.

It finishes with the dominant sourness only slightly mellowed out by sweetness. Overall, a wonderfully complex beer."

This is a fantastically rich and inviting Flanders red ale. It brings all the hallmarks of the beer style to the front. I don't find it overly sour nor over-carbonated and fizzy like some I've experienced. This one is heavy with complexity and nuance.

Very smooth for a Flemish Red. Medium to light body and carbonation.

Overall a world class Flemish red. Well balanced and refreshing. Mildly sour, fruity and funky."
Popular,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.18,"Rodenbach Grand Cru is clear and a deep red color, with leathery highlights. Head is dense, packed, cream colored, and lasting.
On the nose, Rodenbach is tart and fruity up front, smelling pleasantly of sour, ripe cherries. I can practically picture the juiciness of those cherries as they fall from the tree straight into my beer. Oak and vanilla lend support while softening the beer’s overall sourness. This may be my imagination but I could swear I find hints of leather hiding behind the aromas of oak. Unbaked bread lends itself to the flavors, helping the oak in its bid to soften those flavors of ripe fruit tartness.
On the tongue, Rodenbach is smooth and medium bodied. CO2 provides a spritzy carbonation that dances across the tongue. Soft flavors of unbaked bread give a platform for up front tartness which combines deftly with flavors of ripe fruit. Flavors give me ripe cherry as well as red grape minus the tannins. The finish has a lot going on each in its own subtle fashion. Chiefly there’s an earthy quality. Earthiness blends nicely with fruit as well as leather tinted flavors of oak. All of which combines to provide a very gentle flavor profile.
Like previous Flanders Reds, this one has some great character and great balance. Tartness and flavors of ripe fruit dominate without overpowering. Oak aging and a general bready quality help prevent this beer from being too strong in its tartness. Rather, it’s a delicious, refreshing, and greatly accessible example of the style."
Popular,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.4,"I'll keep this brief - wonderful classic beer. It's one of those beers that I've seen on the shelf for years without trying. Now I wonder what took so long.

Over the last several months, the Flanders Red style has emerged as on of my favorites. So much flavor to be had here!"
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,4,"Citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods/ pine forest. Other more non-description tropical fruits appear as this warms. You’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. I agree. Tasty stuff. Big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff. Like many also note, the hops don’t dominate here."
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,3.32,"The can I have isn't expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. If this how this normally is then it's honestly awful to me. Zero hops just malt, like this is so disappointing I'll have to try again to see.


Seeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.


Update, after trying again I more or less confirmed what I thought while also liking this more. Still not for me but for those more into malty IPA'S."
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,3.61,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%., 85 IBU. Orange to amber colour, slightly hazy. Moderate but lasting off-white head with an orangey hue. Pleasant aroma of fruity American hops. The flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish, on a malty sweet (too sweet?) background. Very bitter aftertaste. ""Not for the faint of heart"" - but I MIGHT get used to this ... I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a ""double IPA"". A bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book, but still a good beer."
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,4.04,"Six pack of cans purchased at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington.
Canned on SEP 24 2019. Poured in to an Erdinger pint glass.

Look- Slightly hazy darker golden amber color, glorious off-white head that slowly recedes, beautiful lacing. Light carbonation streaming as it sits.

Smell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), honey/caramel malts, resinous pine, over-ripe tropical fruits (mango, passionfruit and light pineapple), some stone fruit. Light spicy/herbal notes.

Taste- The honey sweet malts are much more prevalent in the taste than the aroma. The hoppy fruitiness and pine assert themselves in the finish, well balanced.

Feel- Rich, full bodied with faint alcohol tones. Very smooth with a solid semi-dry bitter finish. Moderate carbonation on the tongue.

O- A really nice DIPA. A little pricey but I'll be coming back to this one."
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,4.28,"From notes 1/22/12: Pours deep gold/pale amber with 2 fingers of frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head which leaves a heavy, pasty lacing behind as it recedes. Aroma is citrusy orange hops and sweet caramel malts. Taste is huge hoppiness! Oily with orange zest in a malt background of cane syrup and caramel. Big hop bite and bitterness from start into the aftertaste. Taste is complex, almost in an abbey ale sort of way. Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% ABV until the brew reaches room temperature where it blossoms."
Popular,Hercules Double IPA,4.29,"Found this at T0tal W!ne in Houston after missing it on the local shelves for several years.
Probably more than a bit overpriced i.e. you can find better brews for less money. But, it's an excellent beer, good taste but not overly hopped and little or no juniper or other cringe-worthy (for some people!) ingredients. Herc is a very worthwhile brew which has been around for quite a while. If you're looking to test drive an IPA, this is a great choice."

Fresh soap, mild corn & faint dry wheat notes in the nose.

Sticky medium mouthfeel.

Fresh soap & mild orange peel flavors up front; dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish.

A bit off-putting; not so much a melding of styles, as a clashing of styles. Abrasive."
Popular,Raging Bitch,4.25,"Poured on tap at DCA airport in DC. The beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy off-white head. Strong Belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt. Taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end. Like a Belgian funnel throughout, lots of brown sugar, caramel, banana bread, spice. Finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the IPA aspect of things. A really fun take on a Belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises. Recommended."

Popular,Raging Bitch,4.17,"Pours an opaque copper color with a monstrously thick off white colored head that dissipates unevenly leaving tons of lacing. Smell is floral with the complexities of the Belgian yeast present. Has a strong malt backbone with a balanced tropical fruit taste and bitter finish. Mouth is just shy of syrupy but oh so enjoyable. Can remember splitting a 6 with a work colleague @ lunch and not wanting to get much done after that thus calling it a ""Raging Bitch"" kind'a day. A staple that I always try to have on hand in order to turn friends onto. Love the artwork & name."
Popular,Raging Bitch,3.89,"A hazy copper pour, fat head and curtain lacing. Impressive. The nose is quiet medicinal, a bit of lemon. Taste is pungent herbal bitterness, as promised, with pretty solid malts that sit as a firm foundation for the punchy hops. Dry and taxing, this is not one I groove to, but it’s alright."
Popular,Raging Bitch,3.73,"2022 re-review

A decent interpretation of a belgian IPA, not really anything to write home about but not terrible. Deffinitely has more of an IPA than a belgian character, that can be a good or a bad thing depending on what youre looking for.

Pours a translucent orange/brass color with a one finger off white head that laces the glass well.
Aroma is bitter and herbal, fairly nondescript besides notes of grapefruit rind and caramel.

Malt bill is strong and competes for control with the hops. Has a sweet caramel / honey / candied orange flavor predominantly. Yeasty belgian flavor only appears on the aftertaste, its nice but not as bold as I would have expected - showcasing decent flavors of banana and very mild clove. Finishes bitter and dry with hoppy notes of orange zest.

Mid weight body. Alcohol profile is moderate, you can tell its almost 9% yet at the same time this is oddly sessionable.

This is an enjoyable beer for sure; I come back to it every now and then when I want something thirst quenching but strong in ABV."
Popular,Raging Bitch,4.28,3/1/21....pours medium copper amber with light head of off white foam. Cherry fruit and yeasty nose. Spicy fruity flavor. Some cherry. Black currants too. Deep and powerful body. Leaves with an earthy gritty bitter. Solid.

Popular,Raging Bitch,3.84,"Pours dark amber with a thin white head that leaves much lacing. Aroma is typical Belgian with the fruity/clove notes. Taste is as advertised, sharp fruity flavors, with that Belgian banana/clove background. There is some hoppyness in there too, but the fruit flavors dominate. Feel is also as advertised, sharp and drying. Overall, you get what is advertised, but it's not my favorite, but it is interesting."
Popular,Raging Bitch,3.81,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Clear orange colour, big off-white head. Lovely strong aroma of fruity and piney American hops, notes of oranges and slightly caramellized orange marmalade. The flavour is a hoppy explosion from start to finish, fruity (orange marmalade) first, very bitter in the end. There is a considerable malty sweetness that stands up to the bitterness. I don’t get many ""Belgian"" notes out of this ""Belgian IPA"", it is all very American to me."
Popular,Raging Bitch,3.96,"12oz bottle. Best by date is stamped on label as '05:23:21'.
Mostly clear, medium amber colored body. One thin finger of white head recedes to thin cap. Leaves some partial lacing walls away from the drinking side.
Aroma of Belgian yeast, with hint of toasted malt and piney hops.
Taste is up front with piney hops, with a good malt base and an expression of the Belgian yeast. Also has some sweeter tropical fruit hops that emerge late. Aftertaste goes to a sweet mellow place with a blend of the main components. Both the initial flavor push and the end game are tasty, although with different emphasis and balance.
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of syrup. Very good carbonation. There is some piney bitterness but not to a burn or stinging experience.
All components get to present and together they work well in a blend and balance. Flavorful IPA, and more distinct because of the yeast smell and taste. Wild side art work on the label."
Popular,Raging Bitch,4.07,"Clear copper caramel color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing.

Belgian yeast on the nose with a bit of spice and malt in the background. Maybe a hint of dank hop but its light if its there at all.

Luckily the hoppiness is there in the taste. Dank, piney hops up front with the malty Belgian spice flavors coming through in the finish. At times the flavors almost seem to be competing, but really I think they mostly balance out pretty well. The booziness is well hidden.

Mouthfeel is light and easy to sip with nice, zippy carbonation.

This is pretty nice for something different. Turns out that Belgian flavors and west-coast hop flavors marry pretty well. It's just starting to feel like Spring here and I'd say that's the right time to drink one of these. You don't necessarily want all the tropical hop flavors of a NEIPA, so the roasty malt flavors in this one work nicely when there's still a hint of chill in the air."

Popular,Miller High Life,2.39,"Every six months I purchase a 40 oz. bottle of this beer hoping that maybe my taste buds were having a ""bad day"" the last time I drank it. I really want to like the High Life but just can't get past the greasy vegetable oil aftertaste finish this beer gives. Maybe its the Galena hops that they use. I tried to find other beers that use these hops but have had no such luck. Molson Coors has retired very drinkable & palate pleasing lagers such as Extra Gold & even Milwaukee's Best Premium. Hamm's and Banquet are the two most enjoyable AAL's that this brewery brews. Not being a ""hater"" I will buy and drink a 40 of MLH in hopes I will see and taste
something different."
Popular,Miller High Life,2.29,"Acquired as part of a trade/proxy with @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022.

As with all Miller beers, this one looks gorgeous in the glass. It's a crystal clear yellow with a bright white head and bubbles racing up the middle of the glass. It leaves nice lacing on the way down. This is how my old man's beers looked when I was growing up in the 80s. But as with my old man's beers, once you go from eye to mouth, things start going downhill.

On the nose, there's a corny sweetness. It's not appealing in an age of tropical fruit bombs or rich, roasty stouts. There's no hop presence and in fact very little aroma at all. This won't scare off the beer's intended audience, though.

Taste is a letdown even after the nose. There's a minerally, soda water vibe going on. There's some sweet malt, but it's like the beer is produced with postmix and even then the beer syrup in the packet is on its last legs. There is utterly no hop body. The beer has some bitterness, so there are clearly hops in the beer, but maybe they were only waved in the general direction of the boil, rather than actually inserted.

Feel is ok. The carbonation comes through more strongly than I would have expected and it definitely overshadows what taste there is, so the sensation on the swallow again brings to mind carbonated postmix. I've seen a few reviews that point to the beer's excellent softness and generous mouthfeel, but I just don't get it.

I specifically requested some American macros in the trade/proxy that this beer came in, and I'm glad I did, and I will again. Even living in Australia I'm aware of the iconic nature of this beer and its tagline. I'm also aware that it no longer lives up to what a craft beer drinker wants in a beer, but then nor is it meant to. There's an audience for this beer, and it's not a craft beer drinker, but it is a craft beer collector who wants to experience the full gamut of the world's beers, and I'm very much in that camp. It's near impossible to get it through normal channels and I'm glad I went to the effort to get this one. I've loved receiving, pouring and drinking this beer, even though as far as beer goes, it's pretty ordinary. It'll get marked up a little in the overall mark because ultimately it's my overall experience I'm rating here, and in those terms it didn't disappoint at all.

Cheers!"
Popular,Miller High Life,2.52,"Poured into a beer mug and it was a really clear light golden color with a thick white head. Could not really smell much of anything in the glass. Decent taste and a good thirst quencher, especially on a day after working in the yard or around the house."
Popular,Miller High Life,3.92,Looks good smell is not offensive but sweet. Taste has a strong malt sweetness . Very distance hop flavor like all the way at the end of the street. Mouth feel is extremely smooth. I have drank like 200ish bottles in order to make the review and it is a great beer for the price been buying it for 12 pack bottles for $6.50
Popular,Miller High Life,3.28,"Poured from a 7oz pony bottle into a rocks glass.

On the pour not a lot of head forms because there is so little liquid and I was a bit too gentle. Over a couple minute the head actually grows from the streams of carbonation rocking up the sides of the glass. Body is a light golden color just a touch darker than straw, leaves light lacing. Good looking beer.

Aroma is grainy with some skunked hops present. This is likely less present in the canned version, but the clear bottles will definitely be skunky. The skunk isn't overwhelming but present and verging on bad. The maltiness of this beer isn't completely covered however. Some corny vibes but it doesn't smell watered down.

Flavor follows the aroma and loses a bit of the skunk amd trades it for a sweet grainy crisp flavor. Some cheapness does come through but miller makes some pretty good cheap beer. The flavor profile is pretty soft and bready with some very very light notes of the hops on the very back end, however they do still provide some bitterness.

Feel is where miller shines the brightest. On the sip isn't feels big while still being refreshing and not too heavy in the stomach. Big carbonation on this one, but it's fine carbonation giving this one decent body.

Overall I think miller makes one of the best American mass market lagers out there, and so far they haven't let me down. Sweet without being too syrupy and bringing the malt flavor that not hoppy beer should have. Refreshing and not too many off flavors like some AALs."
Popular,Miller High Life,2.75,Most all domestic beer seems to be a disappointment nowadays..Most beer drinkers think that it used to be of much better quality. Miller High Life was at one time regarded as a quality beer then became a cheap trash beer of the 80ies and 90ies. Few years back they improved it with newer type shelf stable yeasts and the quality has actually came back and it's not too bad compared to the other domestic beers out there. With that said I still miss the quality that all domestic U S beer used to have and now lacks.The big breweries think beer drinkers are uneducated slobs and will drink anything because they can't tell the difference.
Popular,Miller High Life,4.26,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds.

Popular,Darkness,4.36,"Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy.
Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.
Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!"
Popular,Darkness,4.42,"2020 release. Poured from undated bottle into a pint glass. It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming. Overall, Darkness is an extremely well crafted RIS and deserves its World-Class rating."

Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.

Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt.

Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon."

APPEARANCE
Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head

AROMA
An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.

TASTE
Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.

MOUTHFEEL
Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.

OVERALL
World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this."
Popular,Darkness,4.59,"2021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.

The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.

The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.

The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.

Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find."

Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.

Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!

Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.

Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly."
Popular,Darkness,4.54,"Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.

Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.

Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.

It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.

This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating."
Popular,Darkness,4.65,"Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.

Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.

Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

The smell is a roasty, dry coffee sort of thing going on with a nice amount of hops allocated inside of some light cocoa. The taste is dry, roasty, bitter and sweet at different times throughout the beer. Some burnt malts seem to come through a bit as the beer warms. The palate is medium to heavy coating my mouth and tongue nicely like it should on a cold winter’s night. Sharpness is slightly there. Overall, I liked it for the most part and would come back to it."

Popular,Smoked Porter,4.18,"22 oz bottle. Smoky aroma and flavor. Tastes a little like burnt coffee--that’s good. Blacker than black, excellent flavor, excellent excellent excellent beer. Fantastic example of the style."
Popular,The Mad Elf,3.93,"Procured via a proxy/trade hybrid with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022 and drunk in September 2022.

The beer is a deep copper colour in the glass with ruby highlights. The head is off-white and quickly reduces to a thin covering. There's lacing on the glass. Minimal, lazy, small-bubbled carbonation is evident.

The nose is complex. There's cherry (verging on that Dr.Pepper artificial cherry aroma), marzipan, sweet caramel malt, maybe some vanilla and cloves and a bit of cinnamon in there. Overlaying it all is a hint of alcohol. To me, it's not all that enticing and comes across as a little harsh in the cherry stakes.

The taste largely follows the nose but the cherry and sweet caramelly malt combine well together in the mouth. The cherry is quite forward, but not as harsh as it was in the nose. I don't pick up any honey but there are what I perceive as Christmas spices in the middle of the swallow At the end, there's a sweet, prolonged tanginess present that demands a further sip. Put together it all tastes really nice.

The mouthfeel is sharp, and appropriate. There's minimal carbonic prickling after the swallow but a nice alcoholic warmth settles in the stomach. I felt some numbness in my mouth while drinking this, and while that could be totally random, it was definitely there. I'm ignoring that for the sake of scoring.

Overall I would definitely go back for another one of these, notwithstanding the 11% ABV and the somewhat harsh notes in the aroma. I'm drinking this on a cold, windy day at the start of Spring and it suits the weather perfectly. Christmas Ales aren't really a thing in Australia, as Christmas can be scorching down here, and while I don't subscribe to the idea that you can't drink heavy dark beers in summer there's no denying that this would be great in the middle of winter accompanied by a fire and great company.

Cheers!"
Popular,The Mad Elf,4.37,"Handsome looking pour . Clear deep red body under a large tan head that left good lacing. Aroma delivers the promised cherries in a non subtle way, along with a good dose of honey and seasonal spices. Flavor takes off in a couple different directions. The yeasty underpinning, the pronounced fruit footprint from the cherries, the added dimension that the spices, particularly the cinnamon, provide and the soft sweetness from the honey all working together. This sampling is from the 2021 production run with a best by date of 11/2022"

Nose has hints of cherries over a very large malt base.

Taste is a large malt base infused with cherries. Hopping tries to balance things out but does not quite get there. Finishes with a touch of cinnamon and a nice warmth with each sip.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and smooth.

Popular,The Mad Elf,4.01,"Read the description involving cherries, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. and heard that Troegs cut down on their supply this year due to low cherry supply- therefore I expected it to be very sweet and cherry forward.

I am not so good with sense of smell, but the taste is very good, I get the flavor of the cherries, could not really get too much honey flavor. The 11% does hit me, but I do prefer a high ABV and I definitely appreciate this Belgian style holiday ale! I always seem happy with products from Troeg's! The one time I was actually at Hershey park, near the Troeg's brewery, but I was not able to visit the brewery. At least their fine products are available near me!"

Popular,The Mad Elf,4.35,"Not much I can add that hasn't been covered in other reviews. The cherries and honey are well-balanced against the malt and alcohol. A very satisfying brew.

Of note, a can that was a year old had a bit more sweetness and less alcohol bite, and was generally smoother. Wonderful just the same."
Popular,The Mad Elf,4.52,"Really great holiday beer. It, packs a punch, so just one with a nice heavy holiday meal is really ideal. Some fruity undertones. A really pleasant heavy hitter that needs to be respected. It was once 13%, but still packs quite a punch."

Popular,The Mad Elf,4.39,"Found this at my local supermarket with a buddy of mine whilst we were studying for some finals in college. Neither of us had heard of this beer, so we thought we'd give it a try with zero expectations. They were room temperature, which was (only was) a bit concerning.

We crack open our first bottle and boy was it pure magic. Both of us agreed right then and there that this was one of the best beers either of us had tasted. Perhaps the stress of the exams with being on an empty stomach stirred up the right conditions to love this beer on that night, but my feelings towards it haven't changed.

Popular,Nut Brown Ale,3.94,"A staple back in the late 80's when so few good beers could be found.
Bright, light brown color and crystal clear supporting a thin barely off-white head that slumps quickly.
Aroma is mild malt with hints of chocolate and brown sugar but you have to go looking for them.
The flavors, at least in retrospect, are solid dark mild / brown ale flavors. Mild and slightly sweet, the complexity of the earthy hops and caramelized grain stand up despite the thin body and mouth feel
Traditional flavors as far as this US drinker can tell though not the depth of character it's label and mystique suggests."

L- Dark brow but you can still se thought it held up to the light. Tan head of frothy bubbles, but not too fine. About 1 finger an dissapates into a ring and a few bubble islands.

S- coffee notes with a dark sweetness and bitter hop notes that balance the malts. Almost herbal funky earthy qualities from the yeast

T- taste follows the smell but is more mellow and creamy. Then it transforms into a roasty slightly bittered aftertaste, the malt and hops work together in this one very well, hops are very traditional.

F- this one is definitely a before bed/winter warmer, very thick and hearty. Good with a big warm traditional steak and potato dinner or maybe a lasagna, comfort foods things like that. Has a nice nostalgic vibe.

O- good to have a couple but not the most seasonable in the world compared to other British styles, but the flavor is very good and the quality shows. A very nice sipper."
Popular,Nut Brown Ale,4.62,"Earthy, bold, highly flavorful, and unique. Tastes like I imagine beer would have tasted when knights in armor stomped this planet. There is an antiquity to the character of this beer, and it is not branding, it is real. A very large range of flavors, from slightly tart to sweet to coffee, cocoa powder, mineral, woodsy, smoky... and something indiscernible to my current vocabulary but extremely good. Creamy, silky feel. Lingering wonderful flavors. One of the best ever no doubt."
Popular,Nut Brown Ale,3.67,"I poured the beer into an imperial pint nonic, a decent pour produces a nice fluffy off white brownish head, it sticks around for a bit and recedes to a thin cap that leaves a little lace with each sip. The color is medium dark brown and is somewhat translucent. The smell is all malt with a little roastyness, nothing grassy or herbal about it. The taste follows the nose, it's not sweet, but not bitter. I find the taste to be lacking in that ashy roasted barley that I find in other brown ales that I like. The feel is straight up medium body with maybe a little more carbonation than I care for, but seems right for the style. Overall, I like it and would revisit, but I have had better examples of the style."
Popular,Nut Brown Ale,4.15,"No obvious date. Only marking I see is SA30T1, on the neck of the bottle.
I've had this several times previous, just never reviewed it, somehow.

Clear chestnut brown, with slight redddish tint if held up to the light. Light tan head, that leaves a thin ring.

Smell is light raisin+date, followed by a nutty (walnut?) aroma after the head fades. Slight, fresh, biscuity malt aroma appears when swirled.

Taste is roasted nuts (walnut+pecan), brown bread, raisin, some hop spiciness, and a vague woody/earthy flavor.

Feel is medium light, initially smooth , with light very,very fine, sharp carbonation bite coming in later. Suspect that this is fairly fresh, or that previous specimens were quite old, as I don't remember it being that sharp. (& I like it better now)

Overall, smooth, easy-drinking, and always a pleasure. Nice to revisit the old standards every now & again."

Nut Brown
Samuel Smith
Date: unknown
I have consumed this beer several times; it surprised me to learn I have not reviewed it. The beer was 44 degrees, and I poured it into a pint glass. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head, a light tan head with good retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a bit of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, mahogany color with ruby hues. When put to a light source, the beer has clarity.

The aromas in the beer are nutty, caramel, toffee, medium roasted malts, a touch of herbal, hint of floral, and malty sweetness.

I taste nuttiness, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, bready, earthiness, a hint of floral, cereal grains, a touch of mineral, and malty sweetness.

The mouthfeel is creamy.

The body is medium, medium-low carbonation, and subtle finish.

A classic nut brown ale with all the goodness to make you go back for more. I enjoy this beer and what this brewery produces. Cheers!"
Popular,Nut Brown Ale,4.15,"From a 22 oz bottle bought with a three bottle gift pack. Enjoyed on the side porch while watching the chicks experience their first real grass! 9/19/21 Lovely malty, caramely aroma. Great mouthfeel and the taste is caramel, roast, and stone. I'm not a huge fan of this type, but this was fantastic!"
Popular,Nut Brown Ale,4.03,"Lovely orangey brown colour. Thick, brown-tinged, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick bands of lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, hint of chocolate, caramel, and red wine. The taste is quite chocolatey, more chocolatey than nutty I think. The mouthfeel is rounded, refreshing, and not too sweet, very well balanced by the slight bitterness of the roasted malts and the gentle hint of earthy hops. Overall a solid English brown ale."
Popular,Obsidian Stout,4.34,"I don’t know why it has taken me this many years to try this beer. It’s really darn good. Very much an American Stout with the piney PNW hopping and bitterness levels. SRM, head color and solid retention is practically perfect."
Popular,Obsidian Stout,4.06,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour a nice head forms my pour was pretty gentle so it wasn't huge, but it was made up of fine light brown bubbles. It fades to a decent ring with some on top. It's pitch black with no light coming through.

Smell is mostly roast with strong note of dark chocolate on top of a nice dark bread base with some earthy piney hops in the mix as well. It's a very pleasant aroma a bit heavy with some lightly fruity fermentation notes.

Taste follows the nose, but with a big bitter hop bite on the front with the roast malts shining through right after. The hop bitterness lingers as the flavor evolves from the hop flavor to the malt roastiness. The fruity fermentation stick around a bit. In the stout it's like raisins or vague dark cherries but it isn't pronounced. Quite nice and very nuanced.

Feel is quite heavy. One of those liquid bread beers and quite thick in the mouth as more head forms. Despite that it's easy to put down and quite smooth. Goes with a meaty meal or just a nice cold night with a good show.

Overall despite being a standard stout at just above 6% it's got a big flavor without adjuncts. Very good what they did with hops water and malt here. Good job."

The earthy hops provide a a nice dry balance. Mouthfeel is slightly milky with a mild chalky feel. This is a terrific example of a stout."
Popular,Obsidian Stout,4.08,"I have enjoyed this brew many times before, but never reviewed. Now is the time. A new hop to me, Delta. The malt profile promises rich creamy and sweet.
An impressive mousse caramel head with microbubbles forms straightaway. Appears nitro but is not. The liquid is black black as expected. Not super thick but enough for 6+ abv. Carbonation only seen when shaken.
Nose: Cocao, chocolate chip cookie, deep roasted coffee notes lingering. Dark and indulgent. Hop presences with malt. Cream. Comperable in smell to Old Rasputin.
The espresso notes are certainly there. It leaves the same aftertaste as biting a coffee bean. Excellent for those who enjoy. Pleasantly lighter than I expexted with a slight bite to balance the malt. There is residual booziness but when combined with the bitter espresso it works well.
A sharp stout.

As a coffee lover this works for me. If you dislike, avoid Obsidian. The mouthfeel is lacking in fullness and action, but is made up for in taste and smell. For Deschutes, I think their Porter is a better option (but not fair, as it is one of the best.)"

Smell= taste: some bitterness, some dark chocolate, some roasted malts. Nice for something not barrel-aged. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinnish side for my preferred stout experience. Cost effective, IMO, compared to some of the better, but pricier, stouts. I would drink this again."
Popular,Obsidian Stout,4.1,"This is a 12oz. bottle dated 11/19/20 poured aggressively into a 20oz. weizen glass. There is a perfect three finger tan head over a very dark cola stout. This stout is way to dark to observe carbonation, After ten minutes the foam settled back to a thin layer with thick lacing left behind.
The aroma is sweet chocolate up front with light coffee in the background.
The flavor is just the opposite, with chocolate up front, but the taste is dominated by the dry, bitter coffee flavors. There is not a noticeable alcohol burn for me. The coffee flavors cut the sweetness very nicely.
There is a silky smooth feel, but not overly heavy. The carbonation feels light.
For me this stout was very enjoyable, but be ready for bitter coffee flavors."
Popular,Obsidian Stout,2.68,"Obsidian is an apt description: dark, opaque, a persistent cappuccino froth for a head. Then I start to get disappointed.

Popular,Black Tuesday,4.96,"Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!
Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.
The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)
The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.
The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.

Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong.

Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation."

Popular,Black Tuesday,5,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!"

Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops. The flavour is indeed a ""palate wrecker"" - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly ""well balanced"" - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a ""typically American double IPA"", and I’ve ""seen it before""- but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!"
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Bright orange color.

Small white head; no lacing.

Smells strongly of high grade marijuana.

Medium mouthfeel, bordering on thick.

Taste is of grapefruit and great ganja. Booze is present but not overpowering.

A delicious beer."
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4.06,"Good solid imperial IPA. Not up there with the best, but nice and solid. In tap at Industry Public House on Leah's b-day weekend in Pittsburgh! Good ending for lunch!

Add: 7/29/20. Trip home from Lancaster after Joy and Andy's wedding. Yes.... It's a palate wrecker!"
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4.19,"From notes 3/9/13: Pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, creamy, drying, oily and drawing."
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4.26,"Pleasantly surprised, as it is not as intense as I thought after reading the description. Hoppy for sure, but relatively smooth and slick. Some malt comes through the hop assault as well, making this a tasty beer. Cheers!"
Popular,Palate Wrecker,3.96,"From the 12 oz. bottle. Pours clear copper/gold color. Hop forward, boozy smell with hints of orange and pine. Malty bitter taste with hints of honey, grapefruit and pine. Bitter to the end. Pretty good but not my fave."
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4.31,"12 oz bottle - not really fresh (best by Aug 2017 - now November 2017) so I would like to try fresh b ut.... despite not fresh kept refrigerated and this was fantastic. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with 1-2 finger head. Caramel malt with citrus/tropical fruit aroma. Taste is sweet citrus, pineapple with distinct pine flavour followed by a dank sticky bitterness coating the mouth. Bites you and then begs you to have more. Appropriately boozy. Great!

Repeat visit as showed up in Edmonton July 2019 .... still great!"
Popular,Palate Wrecker,4.53,"So if you only Love in a beer is hops you can't really do too much better here cause this stops just short of a hop smoothie. I myself am a hops hunter so this is great. The look is about a 9 or 10 in srm in a clear glass in natural sunlight it is a 7. That's a little light since most DIPA is at least a 10. The smell is sweet and piny, nice and smooth with a nice thick forestry sting. The taste is pure hops. You can definitely feel the alcohol but you technically can't tast it cause of the power of the hops. The feel is heavy like a stout with a nice finish that reminds you of a morning coffee. Overall this is a Heavy DIPA that might be able to just get away within the fabled Triple IPA class. It begins and ends with the word Hops"
Popular,Kellerweis,3.87,"I think their label got it right on the nose ""Our Bavarian-style wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove. This hazy-golden beer glows with suspended yeast, creating a velvety texture and refreshing finish."" This is one of the few beers where the label is spot on. Very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on, as well as the very smooth finish."
Popular,Kellerweis,3,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. I turned the bottle upside down before opening. Hazy yellow colour, small white head of poor retention. The aroma has notes of citrus, and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. There are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel.

Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent. The aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen (banana and cloves), but this beer was far from the best h.w. I’ve had (and I love hefeweizens). Fizzy mouthfeel."

The aroma is the wheat banana. The aroma is not over powering, but it is noticeable while preparing for the sip.
The taste follows the nose, banana wheat flavors, the cloves are very faint. There are just enough hops to tame the sweetness on the finish.
The feel is a nice smooth,creamy mouthful.

Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,1,"On the one hand, it’s good to see mule urine not going to waste; on the other, it’s still mule urine.

This is what happens when the giants pretend they can brew a craft beer."
Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,2.54,"Very drinkable, quaffable beer. Nice head, deep amber/pale orange color. No note of hops nose on it. Smell is orangey. First drink was surprising - in that I was expecting a belgian yeast, but it wasn't there. Also lacking was the coriander - though it has a prominent orange juice taste. Goes down easy, clean, not much of an after taste. No discernable hop bitterness or hop citrus hit. I was missing the belgian yeast taste and at least a bit of hops nose to it. Frankly, it tastes like a generic clean ale with some orange juice added.

Certainly a good lawnmower beer, but nothing special and really an outlier of a belgian wheat."

Clearish yellow with a head that lasts. Smells like orange pine-sol, not terrible but sorta chem-y. I like the taste of this, but can't have more than one at a time. Has a harsh grain alcohol element, otherwise it's easy drinking

OK for girl beer ;)"
Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,3.1,"Orangeish liquid. Drank from bottle
So can’t comment on head and lacing. Smell is somewhat fruity. Orange and maybe lemon but it was a stale smelling fruitiness, not necessarily like fresh ingredients. Taste follows suit with a bit of spicy complexity. Not a bad beer. Not a good one either. It is refreshing."
Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,1.2,This was my first time so I have to honestly wonder was this awful or expired? This had this weird yucky taste to it than wasn't like anything that a belgian white should taste like. Fortunately this was a kind of light nastiness. Idk expired or not I don't get a good vibe and this was just nasty.
Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,3.24,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy (~35% opacity), medium golden color with a medium white head. Bubbling and aggressive. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Mild aromas. Some faint pale malts, grains, and hints of citrus. Not much here. (3.00)

Flavor: Flavor is mild too. It has mild pale malts upfront before a sour and grassy note in the middle, before some faint lemon citrus notes. Has a sour and leafy note that lingers. Only mildly sweet. Minimal yeast too. (3.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied, lower carbonation. Finishes with a slight sour note on the finish. (3.25)

Compared to Stone Dayfall 6/13/21: Pours an identical color. Milder aromas/flavors. More sour lemongrass, Less orange, orange peel, bergamot flower, and jasmine. Winner: Dayfall

to Blue Moon LightSky 7/12/21: Pours a darker color. Milder aromas/flavors. More pale/adjunct malts with a larger body. Less juicy orange.

Overall: A pretty bland beer here. Even a disappointment for knowing what I was walking into. The appearance was the best part. Minimal aromas and flavors altogether. A mild sour note is really all I detect that lingers. People on here have described this as similar to Blue Moon, but I would think that Blue Moon would drink far superior. This was bland, sour, and flavorless. (Final Rating: 3.24)"
Popular,Shock Top Belgian White,2.39,"Average to slightly underwhelming. Its hard to not come off a giant beer douche while writing this, but it’s the truth. Shock Top on a summer day is delightful, but after a few sips it just becomes rather meh. That being said, one of the best homemade shandys I’ve ever crafted was with Shock. 1/4th Newman’s Lemonade and 3/4th a glass of Shock and damn you got a good mix. But, if you’re beer needs Newman’s help to be considered good, you don’t have a very good beer. All in all it’s pretty much like gas station coffee: it’s there, you know it sorta tastes like coffee, but it’s not great."
Popular,Daisy Cutter,4.54,"Can't figure out how to read the date code on the bottom but I poured the 16oz can into a pint glass at 63°F. Beautiful clear warm color. It tastes fresh and nutritious. Pleasant subtle flavor of barley but dry, not too sweet. Slight caramel taste. Not too hoppy. Nicely balanced. At 5.2 abv it's a smooth beer, even served at this warmer temperature. I'm glad I picked up four of these!"
Popular,Daisy Cutter,3.19,This beer is an easy consistent beer that’s accessible and in the Midwest and that has made it as one of my go to beers at bars and restaurants. It has a light feel. It doesn’t really distinguish itself from most other IPAs and I don’t really seek it out but it certainly gets the job done.
Popular,Daisy Cutter,3.99,"A bit of a foggy, amber pour, nice white head, some really nice lacing. Snot factory says, pine, citrus. To me this is one of the better Pale Ales, which are becoming harder to find. I think I need to buy this more often."

Overall a gem to drink, and a stellar APA. B+ rating."
Popular,Daisy Cutter,4.19,"Finally got my hands on one of these as I found this classic brew at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona when I was out there not too long ago. Like Sierra Nevada's flagship brew, this deserved to be rated high on here although it wasn't quite the gold standard that it's California counterpart has become.

This had a nice, copper hue to it was it was bright and topped off with plenty of offsetting head as the lacing left behind was somewhat extensive, but wavy and scattered without any hints of rings among the suds. Lots of bread, pine, and orange in the nose with some metallic hops underneath that, as the balance really shone through in the taste. Part fruit, part malt, and part bitter, this was nicely balanced, nicely carbonated, and easily enjoyable with some Caramel Malt, bread, and biscuit to keep the balance in check. as the earthiness became more apparent once this fully warmed up.

Not a lot of bitterness or burn to be had here, as the amount of alcohol was spot-on. Dated 3/3 on the bottom of the can with ""RECKONING"" written below it, there was a ton of pine and bitterness with some acrid lemon and enduring earthiness that left me wanting more. No doubt that this deserves it rating and classic status on here as I'd easily reach for it again, and a chaser of cold water afterwards!"
Popular,Daisy Cutter,4.24,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours orange yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of floral and citrus hops. Tastes of grassy hops with hints or floral and citrus. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
Popular,Daisy Cutter,3.53,"Good orange gold color with light khaki head, 80% transparent.

Nose teased a bit of caramel and produce dept.

Taste was hop led bitterness and a rather restrained malt leading to a watery result for me

Mid bodied but the taste tilted it toward the leaner side.

I was expecting a bit more malt but perhaps I need more experience with the pale ale. All of my tasting scores of pale ales have been lower than IPAs for example."

Smell: Orange and lemon citrus, pine needles and biscuits.

Taste: Crisply dry and balanced, with plenty of citrus, piney and resinous hops along with nice biscuit and caramel malt body.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, slight oily feel, and moderate carbonation.

Overall: Timeless balance of hops and malt, fantastic West Coast APA."
Popular,Daisy Cutter,4.01,"This beer pours a dark golden color, almost amber. Quite clear looking. The head is 2 finger, white, frothy, and fluffy looking. The head retention is quite good, and the head clings to the glass to form nice lacing as it dissipates.
Nose is quite minimal. I do get a faint hint of hops that makes me think of pine.
Up front I get a nice malty biscuit flavor, slightly buttery. This biscuit doesn't last long, because the hops then kick in. They're not as strong as an IPA (of course), but they're there, and linger. The hops tend toward pine. There's also a slight earthy, grassy flavor here also.
Body is crisp, but also full at the same time.
Overall this is a quite delicious beer, and I'm glad we've got it locally now."

Solid mouthfeel with semi-soft carbonation. Starts sweet from the malt but quickly transitions to the piney bitterness.

A fine APA. Plenty of hops flavors for the style though the hop profile didn't wow me."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,"12 oz bottle
Glass: Nonic Pint
Temp at Pour: 47 F
ABV: 6.1%


Look:
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here.

Smell:
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there.

Taste:
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium

Overall:
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.29,"L - black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - notes of semi sweet chocolate, roasted dark malts, coffee - smell is somewhat faint
T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,3.62,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,5,"It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer.

On the newer brown label, the words ""Double Cream"" are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as ""doubly sweet stout"" rather than ""sweet double stout"", which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion.

In other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :)

I've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.02,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly jet black color with a large and massive tan head that slowly elopes into the stout in liquid form. An ever transformation of head into beer that is a beautiful show. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate to strong aromas of smooth coffee roast, creamed coffee, and chocolate milk. Mostly smooth coffee roast and creamed coffee. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of smooth milk chocolate, sweet cream, and creamed coffee. A soft body with a smooth finish. Some smoke off the end. (4.00)

Feel: Medium bodied. Soft, and smooth. Moderate carbonation. (4.00)

Compared to Bells Porter: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More creamed coffee and cream. Less roasted black malt and roast.

Compared to Founders' Porter 1/25/22: Pours a similar color with a slightly lighter colored head. Similar aromas. More smooth chocolate and cream. Slightly less airy coffee roast. Overall, similar.

Overall: This is a pretty good sweet cream stout. It pours an gorgeous appearance. The flavors are primarily focused around creamed coffee and that's what this beer reminds me of. I'm not a milk or cream stout person, but this one might change my mind and could grow on me. (Final Rating: 4.02)"
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,3.41,"Pours black with a finger of off white head reducing to a thick cap; decent lacing. Nose is bitter coffee, herbal and earthy hops, and bakers chocolate.

Taste: Well blended sweet malt, cream/lactose sugars, roasted malt, coffee-like bitterness, and a little bit of char bitterness with a hint of tobacco as well.

Mouthfeel: Certainly holds up to its name. It's nicely thick and creamy smooth. Light carbonation underneath it all.

Overall / Drinkability: A very good stout, and went well with some chocolate covered pretzels. I think this would pair really well with a burger as a substitute for a milkshake. A bit of a sipping beer and I'm finding one is enough, but I would definitely get again."

Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.2,"Pour is esthetically pleasing, no head with a nice straight pour to the bottom of a tullip glass. A nice lacing surrounds the outermost layer of the glass. Best enjoyed cold, but not ice cold. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, hazelnut, roasted malt, with less of a creamy taste but more of a creamy feel. This is the kind of beer that leaves you feeling warm, that snuggles the inside of your stomach. The earthy-ness brings in autumn vibes, a beer best enjoyed sitting next to a fire that’s fueled with oak wood. Not considerable dry. Overall a great dessert beer."

S: Smells rich of coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, slight amount of coffee.
T: Very much follows the nose, sweet dark fruit flaor.
F: Low carbonation, full-bodied, silky, smooth.
O: Not a bad brew, I'd just like it to be more roasted."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.26,"A: Glistening highlights of Merlot outline a pour that was a rich chocolate color. A milky froth capping of one finger, was tan-hide in color, was short lived. Tiny effervesce bubbles slowly make their way though the darken experience in the vessel with a solid gold lace band encircling above like a halo.

S: Creamy rich and milky chocolate character with some marshmallow highlights on the opening nose. Eloquent milky coffee roast is freshly grounded and straight to the glass. Dark chocolate is sweet along with some burnt caramel and cocoa. There's a bit of smokey sweet dark fruit about, cherries and plums in particular that mixes with some roasted pine and silty charred remains. When all is said and done everything blends beautifully together in a balanced way.

T: The flavor was equally rich and rewarding, sweet vanilla and milky roast is very flavorful, along with some smoky wood highlights. Burnt molasses and caramel creamer add sweetness along with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries. There is some roasted pine hop leaves, milky lactose that blends well with the subtle smoky character and backbone. Wet silty ash hints are smooth as silk.

M: Full bodied experience on the mouthful, very creamy, with a lot of depth. A softly carbonated presence with just the right amount of tingle for a big stout beer. Warm roasted warming on the hold.

O: Overall a perfectly balanced brew, smooth and softly roasted sweet cream stout that is dessert in a glass with an exceptional drinkability. Sweet vanilla, rich coffee roastiness defines this drink, like a smooth Italian coffee. Huge creamy mouthful is the explanation point along with a lingering wet silty bitterness that begs for more sips. Poetry in a glass."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.1,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pitch black in color, perhaps a faint ruby on the edges. Somewhat sized brown head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: toasted/roasted grains and malts, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, lactose, burnt caramel, and toffee.

Taste: I'm tasting the toasted/roasted grains and malts especially with some hop bite. Also tasting some more bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Because of this, the sweet notes mentioned in the aroma have more of a minor role, although I can still taste the lactose/milky notes somewhat well. Body is medium-light."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,3.99,"Serving: On tap at Brasil (Houston, TX) served in a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Relatively opaque, dark brown with ruddy tones. Pours with a short head of tan foam and leaves a few streaks of lace.

Smell: Toasty roasted grains and hot chocolate.

Taste: Less assertive roasted malt; coffee, chocolate and caramel. Leans a little sweet and boozy but remains restrained.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth feel and softer carbonation.

Overall: A solid and drinkable, malt focussed stout. Went down well alongside morning coffee."
Popular,Special Double Cream Stout,4.12,"Pours like a syrupy coca cola. Not as fizzy. Very little head in my teku glass. Still practicing smelling - this one I get cold coffee - making me wonder if it would get better as I let it warm up, has been chilling in my very cold fridge. I'm also getting bitter dark chocolate in the smell. I can't wait to taste. Nice classic stout flavor. Not too bitter, some coffee flavors, as I let it rest on my tongue I get a slight numbing experience, only 6.1% abv though. The mouth feel is not as creamy, not as silky as I remember stouts to be, this one being my first in at least a couple years, but I feel like that makes it a bit more drinkable. I do want some water after, it's like a dessert in that way."

Popular,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.48,"12/01/21 It's aged a year and a half since my comment below and it's much more mature in taste. My only characteristic of this beer that is not improved is the mouthfeel. It's a bit on the thin side.
********************************************
My favorite Imperial Stout and this one is just off the brewing/packaging line so it's tasting a bit young. I'll score it higher after some aging."
Popular,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.14,"—deep colored bottle pour with a thin foam cap and an aroma of licorice and vitamin K. The flavor is full and rich, toasted malt, molasses, licorice are prominent. The brew is a bit sweeter than I prefer. The mouthfeel is very smooth."
Popular,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.06,"2011 vintage opened on 1/3/20. Aggressive pour yielded Low carbonation. I poured it back and forth between pint glasses to get it to breathe a bit and roused 0.5 fingers of marshmallowy-thick dark brown head with great retention. Liquid is pitch black. Very good looking. Aroma is molasses and bourbon and cocoa, some vanilla and coffee. Decent aroma. Flavor is remarkably sound after 8-9 years in the cellar and 2 house moves. Only off note is slight cardboard in the aftertaste which knocks the enjoyment down a bit. Strong beer that got a lot mellower in time and is quite enjoyable!"

Popular,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.15,"Two and a half year old 12 oz bottle in a jar glass. Hardly a lick of head. Jet black Body.

Nose has a Molasses-heavy scent. Deeper notes of cinnamon and some leather tones also present more as it warms. Almost black licorice.

Taste is awesome - lots going on. Really like that it is heavy but complex - evolves throughout the pour - sweeter malts pop early and black Malts dance later.

Slick mouthfeel and i think it could stand a bit more bubbles. Maybe a product of it being an aged beer in a bottle.

Really nice - like this beer and think the classic imperial Russian stout malt profile do this beer week."
Popular,Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.17,"355ml bottle from Brewdog.com (£4.90):
A jet black, opaque beer that's got a very fine, tan brown lacing on top but it quickly fades to a bubbly lacing around the circumference a few seconds later. The nose isn't quite as strong as you'd expect from an 11% beer but opens with dark malts, coffee & an earthy bitterness as well as some alcohol & touches of vanilla. The taste is stronger although the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden given the strength, there's plenty dark malts & a few smoked flavours with earthy hops & hints of caramel alongside some dark fruits sitting in the background. Its a full bodied beer with light carbonation & a fairly thick, smooth feel that goes down well with a pleasantly warming feel to round things off; great stuff. "

On the taste I'm getting a fair amount of dark fruit notes but it's melded well together, some baker's chocolate, nice roast character on the finish. Yes, black licorice is a note that I can agree with on this beer. The 11% abv is well hidden, just a slight sting. I also agree that there is a good hop presence on the beer which I can care less for. It's a good RIS but it's not up there with the greats. Cheers! A-"

Popular,Big Bad Baptist,4.43,"Pours black, gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam. Aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate. I could smell this brew all day. Taste is not as carbonated as I thought, a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present, but subdued. None of this is truly as bad as it sounds, but is noticeable. This is very pleasant and for this ABV, very drinkable. An easy to like imperial stout."
Popular,Big Bad Baptist,3.8,"Rel #101. Pours a dark, dark brown with a faint hint of red. Fully opaque in the glass, with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. Aroma is really nice. Rich chocolate dominates, while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded.

Taste is almost the opposite of the nose. No direct coffee notes, but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. There's not much in the way of sweetness, but that's not at all a bad thing. This beer is several years old, and while I can't attest to what it tastes like fresh, it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that I'm really enjoying. Full bodied and smooth going down."

Popular,Big Bad Baptist,4.04,"I did enjoy this and I'd like to try it's other variants. The whiskey wasn't very prevalent but it was there and it helps sometimes but if i want those flavors more I'd probably look elsewhere. That being said the coffee was more subtle than SOB and this was just a more well rounded brew with the roasted coffee still slightly coming forth more. I'm glad the stouts are keeping up to reputation for Epic.

Yo the other reviews are kind of wild and its making me think this is straight up hit or miss depending on the batch and they gotta sort that ish out period."

Popular,La Folie,2,"Notes from 5/19/2020.
Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is dark amber with 1.5 fingers of tan head. Retention is average leaving a thin island of foam.
The intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of fruit, some funk, and oak. Also, there's a dirty diaper smell. It smells like a disposable diaper that's full of baby shit. How unfortunate. I hope it fades and fast.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. The taste has berries, oak, and is super tart. There's a strong wine quality. The shit filled diaper smell comes and goes. I find myself taking a whiff before each sip to make sure the coast is clear of dirty diapers.
The feel is medium in thickness. It's slightly syrupy, has almost no carbonation, and a medium astringency.
Overall, besides the dirty diaper smell, it's far too tart for my taste. With the shit filled diaper smell, it's appropriately ranked #2."

Popular,Curieux,4.5,"First of all, I am 80 and have been drinking beer all my life. Love the high ABV and cost is not a consideration. This is one of my favorites and would buy again. This brew is from a 12 oz. bottle and I am enjoying it very much."
Popular,Curieux,4.14,"Soft, pale yellow body; partially cloudy; thick, dense, sculpted head, white and long lasting; heavy sheets of foam coast the glass. Nice aroma of honey, clover, light bread-y malt notes; slightly herbal. Mild malt flavor infused towards the finish with a nice bourbon undercurrent; spicy, anise and coriander; slight bitterness. Medium body; mild coarseness; balanced alcohol heat presence; rather dry overall.

This is an interesting and tasty take on the tripel beer style. The appearance, smell and taste all point towards its tripel baseline, delivering some nice spicy character. The bourbon barrel aging develops midway through the sip and lingers into the finish. The brewery's label description of ""subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak"" weren't really perceived by me (perhaps in hind-sight I can agree with the caramel and oak points - but they didn't really standout to me). I like the beer and am glad to have one additional bottle of this beer.

Popular,Curieux,4,Pours a deep gold. Light foam. Fruity aroma. A lot going on here. Dried fruit and vanilla body. Not too sweet. A little oaky. Alcohol finish. Well balanced. A must try.
Popular,Curieux,4.06,"12oz bottle courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ. According to the stamp on the label, this was bottled on January 19, 2022. My first Allagash beer in somewhere between 15-20yrs. Once upon a time they were distributed here, but, sadly, that pipeline dried up long ago. I've missed them.

Poured into a Chimay goblet, this was a dark golden amber color, with a thin, bubbly, off-white head.

Fruity and spicy nose, in that order. Not that dramatic. As it warms, a little bit of boozy, bourbon-y sweetness becomes noticable.

Taste is considerably more complex than the nose. It's where the barrel aging becomes apparent. Fruity start, reminiscent of apple juice, and then things get oakey. The bourbon barrels add, in addition to notes of bourbon itself, a vanilla-like aspect, and there's a definite alcohol heat in the background.

The body is light for a 10.2% bba beer, but is definitely not truly light bodied. Mouth feel is lightly creamy.

Is this a Belgian golden ale or a tripel? If this was a Belgian tripel, as it's called here, I find it a bit lacking. I think there should be separate style when it comes to American and Belgian tripels. As an American-brewed Belgian style beer, this is pretty awesome, but it doesn't have that authentic Belgian feel or look. Then again, I've never had a true Belgian-brewed tripel this high in alcohol, at least as far as I can recall, so it's possible one wouldn't have the big, fluffy head one normally associates with Belgian abbey ales. It's very close to being a great beer, but doesn't quite get to that point for me. Anyway, style quibbles aside, I enjoyed this. The bourbon aging didn't drown out the golden ale flavors but augmented them. It's too boozy for me to want a lot of in a sitting, but this was a great beer to drink as a bit of a reward after getting some work around the house done."
Popular,Curieux,4.24,"12 oz bottle poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a clear golden yellow/straw color with a huge white foamy head that slowly recedes leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing.

The aroma has a lot going on, with some banana, apricot, vanilla, peppery spice. Not much actual bourbon aroma, but there is just enough to hint at the barrel aging. Very nice and inviting

The flavor is toasty and lightly bready with some fruity notes. Banana, apricot, coconut, and vanilla complimented by a peppery spiciness, and a sharp finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall this is a nice beer and coming in at a big 10.2% you would expect more booziness, but the alcohol is well masked, making this beer easy to drink. A great example of a style that I took way too long to come around to…"
Popular,Curieux,4.22,"Bottled 4/22/21 . Let sit out for ten minutes , before opening.

Moderately hazy, with 1/2 finger of quickly-dissipating off-white head.

Smell is candied orange rind , with slight barrel aromas (oak & vanilla) .

Taste is similar to aroma, but with the orange rind element less jammy . Slight spiciness, and light bitterness. As it warms, more oak tannin becomes apparent.

Feel is slightly slick , light-medium, with moderate, very,very fine, soft-ish carbonation. Actually feels fairly light for the abv. No apparent alcohol presence.

Overall, pleasant, and surprisingly easy-drinking for what it is. I'd never guess that it's > 10% abv, if I hadn't read the label.

Poured golden honey in color and was topped with an off white head.
Aroma spoke of simpler times, fresh herbs and hops and malts and dancing in the sunshine. No bourbon did I get, but no complaints from me. Wonderful nose.
The taste rather follows. It seems after 6 1/2 years any bourbon from the barrel has been reduced to insignificant proportions. But what remains is a very tasty triple."
Popular,Curieux,4.35,"Poured a hazy light gold with a half finger white fizzy head that dissipated quickly. Nose of mild banana, citrus and subtle bourbon. Light tastes of banana, malt, and hops. Medium bitterness and heat like white pepper or cloves. This gives way to a sweetness and oak most likely from the bourbon barrels. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. The booziness becomes pronounced halfway through the drink. This beer started out on a bit of a ho hum with me and then really grabbed me."

Popular,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,3.61,"Relatively short lived head with almost no lacing. This smells better than it delivers. Appreciating coffee is the first listed description, but the oatmeal factor is almost missing.

Popular,Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.59,"Appearance:
Glacé blackness so absolute it practically absorbs the light around it. Mocha froth culminates into an abundant head that laces deeply but deflates rapidly.

Bouquet:
Homemade brownies soaked in black coffee to the point of dissolving; deep beneath that rich concoction is a slender stratum of barley and raw oats.

Feel:
A creamy cascade of velvety stout whirls about the tongue with a long-lingering mousse softness. Has a dry, earthy finish.

Taste:
A robust burst of dark chocolate syrup, followed closely by smoked oats. The midpoint exhibits spicy Arabic coffee with a sprinkling of shaved cocoa nibs stirred in. Its conclusion is a hyper-fast film reel of caramel malts and vanilla bean paste, abruptly cut by a sharp, chocolatey espresso finale.

Overall:
Marvelous. The 9.4% ABV is thoroughly cloaked under a rich deluge of dark flavors."

Popular,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.59,"Poured from a 12oz can best by 11-30-2022

On the pour a thre finger head forms in my spiegelau IPA glass. The head has very good retention and becomes slightly rocky after a few minutes. Carbonation is fine and highly active.

Aroma is light woth the huge head Overton, but a slightly resinous and dank hop is present with a nice big fruity compliment. Some fermentation notes are present bringing a bit more funk.

Taste follows the aroma with a bit more fermentation, but overall this is a super drinkable hoppy ale, almost dangerously easy to put down. Very light bready malts come out at the end shrouded in the herbal and bitter hops that have lost a lot of the fruity notes once actually drank.

Feel is almost surprisingly light and drinkable. Palate is left with a dry feeling and the hops do stick around for a while, but the malts are much more present in feel and finish despite the lightness at first.

Overall this was decent, amd a nice intro to the happier side for beginners, but for some reason I was expecting a bit more outta this. I probably shouldn't have had their G13 IPA before this one though."

Popular,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.68,"Picked up a can when I was in Milwaukee last month. I guess they're part of the Miller/Coors/global portfolio now. Works for me.

Pours a dark golden color with a light amber aspect to it. Midnight wheat? Is that what gives this a slightly darker SRM hue than your average pale ale? (Much less ""extra"" pale ale) 1/4"" white head. The aroma is straight up C hop throwback mode. I appreciate it. Standard citric bitter rind and pine. Sure its sentimental.

The taste smacks similarly, although the malt bill is a smidge less ""thick"" or hefty than the appearance would suggest. Its a by the numbers C hopped pale ale that goes with a lighter non crystal malt aspect to separate it from the master that is SNPA. It really does tap into that Sierra Nevada vibe, somewhere between their historic ""maltier compared to contemporary beers"" and classic C hop crispness. I'd certainly pick up 6 of these every summer if I had the option."
Popular,420 Extra Pale Ale,3.69,"Pours a slightly chill-hazed light gold. Excellent fluffy white head and lacing.

Aromas are a mixture of pale and caramel malts and citrus. Just a touch of grassy and floral hop.

Pale mildly tart malts at the start and in midstream. Some biscuity character, along with lemon and orange. Then some grass and pine arrive, but never get to IPA volume. Very balanced. Maybe a touch watered.

Medium light bodied. Just this side of crisp. Very drinkable.

This is a solid APA."

Bought at Liquor Shed in Casper.

Pours a fairly clear pale gold, good puffy head of foam, lacing is ok.

Smells of citrus hops, toasted malt, an overall balanced nose. Can conditioned, says it on the can. Believable.

Nice balance between the citrus hops and toasted malt. Some sweet notes for sure, very much hoppy notes and a dryness that usually accompanies a beer that calls itself Extra Pale Ale. Think Sierra Nevada Torpedo.

Good mouthfeel, very good drinkability.

Nice to have this option in town."
Popular,420 Extra Pale Ale,4,"Look: Light orange in color and the pour yields a huge billowing white head that eventually settles to a pillow, leaving behind great lacing
Aroma: Navel oranges, lemons, lime, floral hop notes, some sweet malt, candied dried fruit, and some grassy notes
Taste: A rush of assorted citrus fruits opens it up and as the hit subsides, floral and grassy hop notes follow suit – I get some Koreanspice viburnum, winter daphne, and Hall’s honeysuckle. Malt is there but light in presence and closes with more lemon-lime-led citrus fruit
Mouthfeel: Full but light, pretty clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and finishes clean and slightly soft with zero dryness
Overall: I’m digging this one. I’ve heard of this beer for years, mainly here on BA, but never had it so when I heard they were distributing in Oregon, I had to try one and it’s tasty. It’s a fine Extra Pale Ale with a lot of unique citrusy, grassy, and floral notes that set it apart from many others already available and I can definitely see myself getting and keeping this one in rotation as we move into the warm months."

Popular,420 Extra Pale Ale,2.73,"It pours a transparent straw color, with a white head, and sharp hoppy nose. The taste definitely has the traditional sharp hop flavor, but there's a funky flavor that's overpowering everything else. I'm not sure if it's intentional, or if this bottle was skunked. The palate eventually clears, with a small hoppy finish. I would want to try this from another source to see if this is an accurate example."

T - Tastes like they added cherries to a wheat beer. Exactly what the label indicates, but the beer flavor and cherry flavor do not mix at all.

F - Has good carbonation.

O - Overall, I didn’t like this beer. It’s literally like taking a wheat beer and adding cherries and/or cherry flavoring. It doesn’t work for me. Maybe if you love cherries you’d like this, but for that kind of cherry flavoring, you’re better off with a flavored hard lemonade or something. Did not finish. Not recommended."

Popular,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,2.94,"Best by 3/2022

You know, as stupid as it may sound, this was one of the first beers I searched for when I began drinking underage. Me and my friends lusted after it but were never able to secure it. Flash forward years later, and I find singles of it at my local store. For the hell of it, I picked one up just to see for myself what I was missing years ago (probably not much)

Pours a cloudy gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh man, the cherry here is super artificial in the nose, very candy-like. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry jolly rancher, lime juice, crackery malt, earthy wheat, and light honey

While the aroma was definitely candy forward, it also promised a fruity tartness. The taste is a huge letdown in the wake of this, not very good at all. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, cracker, sweet honey, and lemon rind. The swallow takes a nose dive in quality, bringing notes of cherry cough syrup, doughy malt, earthy wheat, and sticky seeet honey

A promising start of a light body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a refreshing beer. But it finishes sad and sticky, just way too sweet

Ok so it’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s pretty amusing to see what younger me was missing. Not worth repeating"
Popular,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.68,"Mostly pale in color, was definitely expecting a hue more representative of a cherry. Lots of cherry on the nose, more artificial though, really similar to a cherry 7up. Taste followed the nose with a hint of a wheat backbone. Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Not terrible, but nothing groundbreaking. Decent overall."
Popular,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.63,"With a bright golden complexion and refreshing appearance, the Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is wonderful summertime option. I took this along on a midmorning hike over Labor Day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this sweet and light beer in the woods. Immediately, your nose is hit with cherry, fruity and bread like aromas. Following into a sip and a pleasant candy-like cherry flavor plays with you taste buds. There is an almost dry finish to it and at the end you're not really itching for another. A sweet fun change up, but once in awhile. Not really a go to for me, but enjoyed the experience."
Popular,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden color with a soft white head. SRM of 7. (3.50)

Aroma: Strong and intense aromas of sweet cherry upfront. There's sweet and candied cherry and faint syrup. Some bread, cream, and hints of vanilla through the end. (3.50)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more candied cherry. This is followed by a bready and soft wheat malt. Finishes creamy to clean off the cherry sweetness. (3.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to stronger carbonation. Finishes soft and clean on the palate. (4.00)

Compared to Castle Danger's Castle Cream Ale 5/27/21: Pours a more golden color. Stronger aromas/flavors. Much more cherry obviously. Less cream and malt liquor flavor.

Overall: I wasn't sure what to expect of this one because some said the cherry was mild, while others found it overpowering. Whoever said the cherry was overpowering was right. The cherry is strong here. Lots of candied cherry. Smells like a cherry Blow-Pop and tastes sort of like cherry pie. (Final Rating: 3.50)"

Pours a clear but dark reddish purple, smallish head. Smell is raspberries.

Taste is raspberries. Raspberry jam. Maybe a slight tartness, but mostly very sweet.

Mouthfeel is medium, smooth. Maybe slightly sticky. Overall...it's pretty good. If you're looking for raspberry juice, it's very good."
Popular,Raspberry Tart,4.71,"12oz bottle (no date, but I was told it was from 2021) served in a Libby globe porter glass.

Appearance: Clear purple-red-amber color. Thin off-white/pink ring of foam with an occasional island of lacing.

Smell: Raspberry, with a tiny bit of sour tang to it.

Taste: Nice tart rapspberry tempered with some sweetness, and a lingering fruity bitter/tart finish. Very nice!

Mouthfeel: Slick, a bit sticky, good carbonation. Dry finish.

Overall / Drinkability: This really is a great raspberry beer. I'd easily say this is a raspberry lambic, and a very well balanced one. Easily drinkable and I could pair this with a variety of desserts. I'm a bit surprised it's listed as a ""Fruit and Field"" beer given the character and the way the brewers make it. Well done and I definitely would want another."
Popular,Raspberry Tart,5,"All the sweetness and tartness you could possibly ask for in a fruited beer. New Glarus usually nails it, but their line up of fruit beers are totally our of this world good."
Popular,Raspberry Tart,3.88,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into my stemmed New Glarus glass. This beer, pours a dark red wine look with an inch and a half of raspberry colored foam that slowly settled back to a thin pink cap. When held up to the light, heavy amounts of carbonation can be observed.
The aroma is sweet raspberry jam.
Tart is the perfect description! There is tart raspberries with a sweet bubbly and tart again finish. The carbonation plays a big part in the taste and mouth feel.
This is not what I expect or crave from a beer. The taste is pleasant though."
Popular,Raspberry Tart,4.33,"Part of the midwestern milieu migrated my direction thanks to @FBarber in NBS BIF #13.

Rusty, plum juice red colour. Small wet head that quickly disappears leaving nothing but a few stray bubbles.

Nose has some sweet and tart of the raspberries that honestly kind of reminds me of marinara sauce. Ultimately beyond that there's deep aged berry aroma, like a raspberry wine.

Oooh man. Honestly, that's fucking delicious. It is raspberry juice. It is what it is. But I love raspberries. Late season berries, deep red, cool, just a touch of bramble tart. Jammy and delicious.

Moderate body I suppose, with a dry finish in contrast to the jammy berry carrying tool, and spicy/sharp/compressed carbonation.

I'll be honest. I love raspberry. And that strongly colours my review here. But that's an important component of it. New Glarus is really good at what they do. This beer is yet another NG brew that is blatantly competently composed, and in this case (as opposed to some of the other NG brews I've been fortunate enough to try), that happens to also align with a fruit expression that is right up my alley. This is easily my favourite of the New Glarus fruit beers I've tried, and now I'm sad I only have the one bottle.

Thanks Frank for sending it my direction! Cheers!"

Pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

It doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose, but what’s there is pretty good. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, floral hops, lemon zest, honey, and light pepper

It’s a bit more expressive in taste, but still not a punch in the face or anything. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, crackery malt, honey, orange zest, and green tea. The swallow brings notes of black tea, floral hops, biscuity malt, honey, toasted grain, and light orange

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry but a bit watery

Taste is malty toast with a hint of char, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, cream and yeast backed by a hoppy bitterness. Average at best, To tell the truth I'm a little disappointed based on what I have come to expect from this brewery. Taste more like a bitter Amber Ale than an English Bitter."
Popular,Honker's Ale,4.06,"It's funny that the best English Bitter that I had is made by an American brewery.
As it has much morecontent, aromaand flavor than the English counterparts, I vote this the best I've ever had.
Along with the typical/trademark English Bitter light/watery body, it has enough malts and most importantly, fragrant hops that stand out in the aroma. The taste is also quite well balanced, does not get too light nor too dry bitter so I found it overall nice - although not to an extent that I would want to drink it again. I loved the aroma though, it was a pleasant beer."

aroma is caramel malt, slight pine and orange, lemon, and grass

taste follows that up, pretty straightforwardly. orange marmalade and caramel malt take center stage

mouthfeel is higher carbonation and medium-light body that runs crisp, slightly watery, and grainy, with a crisp dry finish and a lemon-laced caramel malt aftertaste

overall:
a far from boring session worthy pale ale that aligns itself with more traditional pale's of the english variety at times, while bringing in solid pine resin notes to boot. solid digs"
Popular,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.85,"Apple cider in color. Not much of a head. Smells mild, citrus hops, hints of lemon. Malty upfront and on the body, surprisingly. The hops come out at the end. It finishes dry.
This is balanced very well— the malt and hops are blended together so well it’s a little hard to tell what’s what, and I think that’s a good thing for this beer. It’s mild, it’s subtle, it’s an easy drinking pale ale. What else could you ask for?"
Popular,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.07,"2021-03-30
12oz can served in a tulip. Dated 02-10-21. It was left in my AirBnB fridge, so I'm pretty stoked by the relatively reasonable date.

Pours a surprisingly dark amber with a medium sized head. It's not hazy, but it's not clear. There are definitely some little flakes of sediment floating around and there and settling into the bottom of the glass. Smell is nice, clear piny grassy hoppy notes and a definite malty/grain sweetness.

Taste is pretty much what a pale ale ought to be. Moderate grainy sweetness, a tiny bit of a tea like characteristic, maybe the slightest nuttiness or toffee to spice things up a little bit, medium but building pine bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is medium-light with a very dry finish. Overall, this is a classic pale ale.

T- Interesting oat biscuit malt hits first, then a smooth light sweetness that leads up to a lightly bitter finish. This malty sweetness is nicely balanced with a tangy hop note that keep you coming back for some more.

M- Smooth and slick with light carbonation and a finish that keeps it lightly dry with a touch of sticky thickness.

Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and slightly soft on the finish with no detectable dryness
Overall: Tasty stuff here as it should be. A Pacific Northwest cult classic and continues to be unwavering in its presentation – citrus and floral hops, good bready malt presence, clean, and ridiculously quaffable.

The pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head.

Smells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer.

The flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes."

Popular,Spotted Cow,4.39,"They call this a Saison, but think of it as a cream ale. Pale color and very unassuming nose, though the malt character is very nice. This beer really leans on its smoothness. Subtle fruit, toffee candy. Very soft and kind of foamy in a good way with barely an aftertaste. Ales like this aren't necessaily incredible, but they are incredibly hard to find in the other 49 states."
Popular,Spotted Cow,3.97,"While I found my original review to be amusing, it was too dated to remain in light of my current notes, so I am starting fresh.

Barely foggy straw yellow with a white foam head of moderate height settling to a softly persistent blanket and wavy ridge.

Like a mild, floral hefe on the nose, and closer to a Belgian wit in taste--even including a hint of orange peel and wheat--this is such an enigma (not to be confused with their very own Enigma)!

The medium body has a fine froth that comes to a tingly semi-dry finish.

No wonder it has such staying power, there's nothing like it out there, yet it's still quite drinkable."
Popular,Spotted Cow,3.89,"Got this given to me by a guy who went to Wisconsin for family and brought home beer.
Poured amber with active carbonation and an off white head.
The aroma was faint for me, I think it had some malt or other cereal.
The taste was cereal and malts first and foremost. Nice enough, but a saison should have some funk or tart, right? Not sure if any are here. The taste is great, just not a saison flavor.
The feel was good, not viscous and not watered down, just nicely quaffable.
Glad I finally got to try this, cheers!"
Popular,Spotted Cow,4.55,"Great beer brewed in my state. Classified by the brewery as a farmhouse ale, the flavors are not intense yet are tangy and refreshing. Tastes of grain, malt and yeast. Easy to see why it is absolutely everywhere in Wisconsin."
Popular,Spotted Cow,3.84,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Looks very good. Glassy yellow body with a generous white head. This maintains throughout, leaving scattered lacing.

Nice light belgiany aroma, a little yeast.

On tasting, light and clean, very easy drinking, has all the hallmarks of a saison, but very much subdued.

Mouth between medium and full, finish slightly grainy and a little yeasty.

Overall, a very nice light saison on a warm Pennsylvania evening."
Popular,Spotted Cow,3.93,"12oz can stamped I2221003 poured into a vintage footed bar glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on label. The beer pours just clearer than hefe-hazy in a medium amber color. The head is off white and settles to a ring and island after a few minutes. The aroma is mild with fruity and farmhouse esters. The taste is semisweet pale malt with mild clove and relatively minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent everyday beer. I don't know that I'd stretch and call it a farmhouse ale, but I'd drink it anytime it was offered."

F: light medium mouthfeel medium heavy carbonation and it doesn't taste like a very dry beer, which is nice

O: Very common where I live so its cheap but overall its an excellent local craft beer"
Popular,Spotted Cow,4,"I rated this 4 because I rated it a 4 on Untappd (so sue me,ok). It's a good, crushable beer. The description says they leave some yeast in it. The one I just had has more rustic/barnyard funk to it than the others of this I have had I suppose becsuse of the bottle conditioning. I never really have thought of this as a farmhouse ale, even though that's what Dan Carey calls it. It's a good beer, but certainly NOT the best beer New Glarus does. My overall issue with this beer is that with as many good beers as New Glarus does do, this one is the most ubiquitous. It's EVERYWHERE in Wisconsin. There are more beers I would rather have from them if Spotted Cow wasn't taking up so much shelf space."
Popular,Spotted Cow,2.66,"Looks slightly cloudy light gold, medium loose white head.
Has an average aroma of malt and mineral water, No funk or barnyard you expect from saisons.
Tastes like a kolsch, slightly malt forward, very average beer. They state on the can that they use German ale yeast, not sure how they can expect it to magically turn into a saison.
It’s not bad tasting, just not anything resembling a farm house style ale."
Popular,Lager,3.94,"Solid beer and always has been.
A lager with some balls and body.
Bright, deep golden color with an even brighter white head of dense foam - good legs and cling.
Aroma is traditional German hop up front with an underlying malt sweetness.
Flavor is balanced and complex - for a lager , with clean, mildy bitter finish.
Great light-medium body excellent drinkability."
Popular,Lager,3.21,"Pours a clear orange amber, light 0.5"" head, few bubbles of lazy carbonation. Nose is light caramel, baked rye bread, allspice, clove, bit of wet hay. Taste has a mild malt sweetness, very light noble hop character, touch of pine. Mouthfeel is moderate, carbonation light. Overall, the flavors are muted and somewhat flat, which may be the result of some less than optimal bodega storage."

Burnt caramel, stale corn & mild grapefruit notes in the nose; my god, this smells pretty bad, and nothing like any lager I've ever had!

Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Caramel, stale corn, grapefruit & baking soda flavors.

My word, I hope something went wrong here. Bad for any style, but an awful misfire of a lager. I'll try to snag another batch to confirm, but this was awful."

L: clear pure amber in color. Thin white head. Some fast carbonation rising.

S: cereal malt. Wheat and extremely faint grass hops.

T: light caramel, more cereal malt. Slightly floral. Not overly complex. Bread. Very standard amber lager notes.

F: crisp, medium bodied for a lager, not overly hoppy.

O: a standard but pretty good American amber lager. Would pair easily."
Popular,Lager,4.25,"Blows Yuengling lager and Sham Addumbs Boston lager away, and it's not even close. Cost a little more than either of those imposters, but it's NYC overhyped pricing. Probably the best thing NYshitty can offer the intelligent world."
Popular,Lager,4.19,"A- This pours a dark amber/golden color, and shows off generally clear....perhaps with some mild chill hazing. There is multiple steady streams of fizz rising in slow but uniform manner, maintaining a base layer of foamy head. This, by the way is about one and a half fingers in thickness to begin with, before the eggshell colored foam slowly dissipates into a clumpy thin/thick covering over the lager. The lacing is quite sticky too, with a thick film coating the inside of my glass....a very nice looking lager beer indeed!

S- I detect a well balanced blend of caramel sweet malted barley, and the robustness of the Vienna style lager here shines, alongside a mild, yet distinct hop cone bitterness. Floral petals, muted piney notes, grassy dry grain, whole grain mountain bread and on the finish, an ever gentle peppery leafy spice.

T- Now this is a tasty lager! Flavors follow the aforementioned aromas quite closely, with piney nuances balanced out by toffee/caramel sweet malts....these also showcase some toasty quality and there is a dry biscuit graininess on the palate too. Slight pepper spice, and a bread yeast flavor that lingers after the swallow. A very decent flavorful lager!

M/O- Light and crisp in body, with perhaps a slight leaning into medium bodied territory. The carbonation is smooth yet fizzy enough to allow the full flavors to explode on the palate. I find the drinkability factor to be high and would have no issues enjoying this throughout an evening. It is a very tasty lager and in my opinion, one of the best that I have had! Excellent fare!"
Popular,Lager,3.52,"Pours a clear golden color, small white head fades quickly, no lacing.
Baked bread, caramel mild hop aroma.
Flavors match the aroma.
Kind of thin, not much carbonation..
Tasty, but really nothing to get excited about."
Popular,Lager,3.5,"I don't often drink lager, but I am finding a slight preference for Vienna style when i do drink it. The malt is not especially sweet and the low abv beer can sometimes hit the spot. I had this bottle on election night 2020 when I was only drinking beer from blue states."

Russian River Brewing
Date: 08 May 2020
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance.

The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness.

I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.

The mouthfeel is dry and spicy.

The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish.

I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer."
Popular,Damnation,3.03,"I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment.
It is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!"
Popular,Damnation,4.23,"Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.
The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.

Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley."
Popular,Damnation,4.18,"Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body. Head lasts indefinitely. Nose is citrusy and yeasty, lots of esters. Taste follows with an almost dry spicy finish. Reminiscent of many pale Belgian brews."
Popular,Damnation,4.56,"Another great Beer by Russian River!
*Looks: Classic-Strong Belgian ale appearance, pale amber colored, semi-opaque
*Aroma: Mild malt, pilsner, mild bread/yeasty
*Taste: This a well-made, damn good Belgian Style Ale! Honestly if this were a blind tasting, I wouldn’t know the difference alongside La Fin Du Monde, Dūvel, Chimay, Westmalle etc.
*Finish: mildly warm at 7.5% abv, easy on palate but slightly, only slightly heavy.
*Overall Verdict*: Beautiful, artistically crafted, strong Belgian Ale by Russian River. Super work of art if you like Belgian style!"
Popular,Damnation,3.86,"Has a decent head, beautiful hazy, Golden, effervescent look. Smell, a tad metallic, Typical yeast odor, not much smell at all. First touch in tongue yields mild bitter reaction, but mellows immediately. Notes of apricot, sour dough, some pine, and fruit notes. I don’t taste the spice, but feel the warmth from it. Overall, a mellow, but refreshing flavor. Mouth feel, is creamy and gentle, medium body. Overall, A good beer."
Popular,Damnation,4.21,"Pours a foggy pale orange with a fluffy three fingers of off-white foam. Head retention is great, forming a stoic layer above the beer for a long time. Aroma is pale, biscuity, wafery, crackery, earthy malts with slight resiny, herbal hops. A little clove rounds it out. Flavor profile is resiny, herbal, grassy hops that reside at the back of the tongue after the malts finish singing the chorus. Malts are biscuity, wafery, crackery and pale. A little lemon grass and clove lingers towards the finish. Mouth feel has a bubbly effervescent that somehow expands and fizzes on the tongue as it hits, growing the texture from start to swallow. Crispness creeps on towards the finish, after the initial foamy expansion on the tongue. Overall, bubbly and yet crisp with a refreshing display of malts and hops behind. Balance is great with a little playfulness.

It’s been awhile since I’ve had a Duvel to be honest but I think I might prefer it. That’s not to say this is bad, but Duvel is amazing. I’m not getting a lot on the nose. It’s dry with a bit of funk. I wouldn’t know it’s a Belgian immediately but after a couple of sips it’s apparent. A great beer but maybe better fresh?"
Popular,Damnation,4.08,"Pours a medium straw color - like an IPA. Sweet Belgian candi sugar aroma. Flavor is very typical of a Belgian, but softer from the age. Touch of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is appropriate, medium bodied. Overall an ok beer, might have aged it too long...

Wheat malt and fruity pear aromas with light notes of under-ripe banana. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Creamy smooth feel with expanding boozy warmth through the finish. Sweet fruit flavors, pear and light banana followed by spicy coriander. Malty and fruity flavors on the back end with spicy coriander tapering to the end. Finished dryly with a lingering spicy flavor. Fantastic display of Belgian esters. Mellow fruitiness balanced with spiciness and boozy warmth."
Popular,Damnation,4.06,"Pours a light yellow with a mild haze to it. Huge head formation. When it calms down it recedes to a finger of pure white foam. It persists for quite a while.

Nose is yeast funk, banana, clove, mild citrus zest, perhaps lemon. Vibrant scents jumping out of the glass. Very appealing.

Taste is denser than the nose. Richer. But similar. Some nice bitterness from the hops counteracting the touch of sweetness from the malt.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Very smooth.

Not a huge fan of the Belgian Pale Ales, but I was quite impressed with this brew. Having limited access to Russian River its hard to snag bottles, but I pick one up whenever I get the chance. I look forward to seeing the rest of their accomplishments."
Popular,Damnation,3.88,"Rating from notes. 375 ml bottle purchased by my wife at City Beer Store in San Francisco, California. Consumed January 2014. ""Bang on for the style."" 3.88/5"
Popular,Damnation,4.5,"I got one of these expensive bottles of World-Class beer from Whole Foods for $7 each. Poured into a stemless wine glass because I don't have a tulip or goblet, the recommended glassware for this style.

Look: The golden color of the body is reminiscent of unfiltered Buckwheat honey, an orange-hued amber. Super fluffy, frothy, choppy, and billowing slightly off-white head. The body is hazy and shows ample carbonation from the bottle fermentation. When the cork is popped, the bottle oozes smoke like some Harry Potter shit. The lacing drags down the glass like foamy bunting.

Smell: Right after popping the cork, I immediately get an incredibly complex aroma of toasted challah, fig, a touch of orange zest, phenolic clove, banana, delicate white pepper, and caramel. This stuff smells mouthwateringly good.

Taste/Mouthfeel: The incredibly rich bready taste has mounds of caramel, toasted challah bread, browned butter, light hop spice, earthy hops, biscuit, and sophisticated yeast-derived banana and fig flavors intertwined throughout the perfectly balanced yet still malt dominant flavor profile. The flavors explode across the palate as this liquid genius glides down the throat. The hopping perfectly balances and complements the other flavors, yielding pure earthy and slightly spicy mild bitterness to back things up. The body is overall a solid medium; hearty with enjoyable chewiness. The well-hidden alcohol is slightly warming as the beer comes up in temp, with a reassuring kiss of sultry euphoria that caresses the mind and spirit.

Overall: Incredible this beer is outstanding evidence of just how good Russian River Valley is. I loved digging my nose into the soft, smooth foam of the aromatic head and gulping down the cool liquid genius. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, with such deliciousness that each richly pleasurable drink makes you go ""mmm"" and smack your lips. This is one of the best breweries in the world. This beer is extremely delicious in every way. A fantastic example of the style, one of the best beers I have ever had."

Popular,Summer Shandy,3.3,"They have an origin story about a guy mixing beer with lemonade on the side of this can. That pretty accurately describes what this beer tastes like, but neither is bringing its 'A' game. On the beer end, there is light malt and an underlying steely industrial quality. On the lemonade end, it's a bit watered down. Still, it balances sweetness and tartness to an appropriate degree. It has your standard light beer feel, with a light mouthfeel and sharp carbonation. I enjoyed it for its freshness and it is better than most macros you can buy if only for its lemon flavor."
Popular,Summer Shandy,3.44,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy light color with a one finger head that dissipates down to a film and then a ring. Agitation brings back a half finger head.

T - Taste follows scent as a lemonade flavored beer. There is some mild flavorful grapefruit bitterness in there as well.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some zesty carbonation.

O - Overall this is a solid summer option. Very good in 95+ degree weather. I like that this gives me the flavor like a hard lemonade, but doesn’t come in overly sweet or sugary. I’d recommend this as a solid summer, outdoor, and camping option"

Popular,Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.96,"Appearance: Pours a slightly clouded (80% clarity) medium golden color with a sizable white head that lingers. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas upfront of bready malts, citrus, bread spice, banana, juicyfruit bubblegum, and more Belgian spices. Definite German aromas. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread, banana, bread spice and yeast. More banana than the nose. Some Belgian spices including cloves and bubblegum to support. Sweet banana bread lingers off the finish with maybe hints of darker fruit, but they are not pronounced. (3.75)

Feel: Medium to larger bodied. Strong carbonation as expected. A malty, but balanced, clean finish from the yeast and carbonation. However the booze is slightly detectable off the end. (4.00)

Overall: My first at the Weizenbock style. This one drinks very well. Nice banana bread, bread spice, bubblegum flavors. Sort of like a Hefeweizen with a bit more citrus and fruity characteristics. Don't get too much dark fruit, but probably buried by the bready flavors. Only criticism is the booze is slightly detectable. I think this one could drink even better cut down 1-2% in ABV. Nevertheless, my first impression at this one is pretty good. (Rating:"

The aroma is very pleasant, big clove and banana yeast, bubblegum, citrus, spice, wheat, and a bit of booze. The flavors are very good, lots of stone fruits, clove, spice, bubblegum, wheat, fusel alcohol, wildflower and some lingering straw earthiness.

Popular,Weihenstephaner Vitus,5,"I have been drinking American craft beer for about 15 years now, and I was always impressed how great American hops and malts were. I didn't know what I was missing with German beer. Absolutely world-class brew poured into a pint glass at 52F.
Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a white head that dwindles down to a ring around the glass that persists.
Smells of wheat, banana, divinity with nuts bordering on marshmallow.
Taste follows the smell; it's sweet, but it's not syrupy. If this beer does contain hops, they are so well blended that it's indistinguishable on the front end. Possibly a tiny bitter hit in the aftertaste.
Fantastically well blended and carbonated. Velvety smooth with a medium body makes it very easy to drink. Alcohol is quite unnoticeable.
I can see why Weihenstephaner has top ranking brews in at least two categories, as their beer is world-class AMAZING! Overall, I would be shorting them if I didn't give it a full 5 across the board."

Popular,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.12,"0.33 L bottle
Bottle Date: 9201 (26 May, 2021 ?)
Glass: Tulip
Pouring Temp: 44 F

Look:
Opaque golden yellow with a creamy white head that fills the space in the glass not filled with liquid. The head slowly collapses to a consistent cover. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Citrus fruits. Ripe banana. Honeysuckle. Light honey such as acacia or clover. Allspice and cloves. There is a restrained sweetness that undergirds everything.

Taste:
A citrus bite starts things off mixed with sweet banana. The allspice and cloves then bite some and keep things in balance. There is a nice flowery note as well. The finish is soft and sweet with a touch of fading cloves. The spices accumulate as the beer is consumed.

Feel:
Soft, smooth and creamy. Body is medium with a lean towards the full side.

Overall:
A tasty and complex Heller Weizenbock. I prefer Dunkler Weizenbocks like Aventinus, but this beer isn't a slouch by any means. For me, this is a good beer for spring and early summer. I actually view it as a Weizen-based Maibock, with the cloves standing in for hops."
Popular,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.36,"Hefeweizen appearance--hazy golden, just slightly translucent, with huge cap of foamy white head. Great retention, due to the wheat, no doubt.

On the nose, underripe mango, dried apricot, (good call from the brewery description) banana, vanilla, hay, white pepper, rich chewy white bready malt.

The mouthfeel is hefty and fluffy but made superbly drinkable through the fairly high carbonation that cuts through it.

A Weizenbock. This is a great beer."
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful.
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this.
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this.
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone.
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be."

Popular,Anchor Porter,4.17,The Porter is a dark beer and I got a two finger mocha head in a nonic. The roasty chocolate smell is inviting. The taste is roasty and finishes bitter. The solid mouthfeel bites back with the lingering bitterness. Overall an enjoyable porter.
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.17,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown with
a very nice head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping layer,
and shows off some nice lacing. Nose of dark coffee, dark cocoa, moderate char,
and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. Flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes
of black and raspberry, dark cocoa, dark coffee, char, and balanced sweet
caramel malts. Nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium,
smooth, lightly coating, light carbonation, and a balanced char and roast finish
that is lightly dry.

Overall---EXCELLENCE!

Cheers"
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.15,"Opened this fresh 12 ouncer and drank it straight from the bottle.
This is a superb everyday Porter, richly delicious, tastes of coffee, mild chocolate, dark malt. Drinks light. Finishes crisp. Excellent American display of the style."
Popular,Anchor Porter,3.9,A true American classic. This porter is quite a treat bursting with caramel and chocolate notes. A deep brown dark chocolate color with a nice white-brown head is magnificent. Raise to your nose and you are met with roasted aromas and the beer tastes malty and smooth like melted dark chocolate. A great beer reminiscent of a mocha coffee.
Popular,Anchor Porter,2.11,"From the rear label: ""PKG050521""

Appearance: It has a black body with a large, thick, khaki head. The head has a creamy texture on top with shallow lumps and ripples across its surface. Head retention is good and as it slowly recedes it leaves a nice sheet of thick cobweb lacing with large round gaps in the sheeting. It looks exactly like you would picture a Porter in a magazine.

Aroma: There isn't much going on in the aroma here. It has a bit of a phenolic, rubbery scent. As the beer sits there is a scent of nail polish. Very odd aromas.

Taste: Up front there is nail polish and a bit of toasted caramel. Towards the middle the nail polish character comes through even stronger. There is a pleasant note of coffee and faint burnt carbon. The nail polish character really kills the other flavors.

Mouthfeel: There is a medium roasted grain bitterness to the beer and a body that rests on the upper edge of medium. Carbonation feels fine. Drinkability is low given the flavor and aromas.

Overall: A very disappointing beer. The off-flavors in this beer really hamper any positive characters that might have a chance at getting out. I wouldn't recommend this beer. I wouldn't buy it again unless I could try it directly from the brewery to see if it was an issue with the batch, the packaging, or if the recipe is consistently like this."
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.65,"Black with a tan head, excellent retention and lace

Popular,Anchor Porter,4.13,"Serving: 12 oz bottle (“PKG090821”) poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.

Taste: Dark malt and hops, leaning more towards roasted grains, coffee, earthy minerals and crisp bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with lively carbonation.

Overall: Both bright and dark, well hopped and deeply, roasted malt."
Popular,Anchor Porter,3.63,Pours very dark. Dark foam. Chocolate aroma. Dry hop body. Chocolate and coffee are present. Fades to a deep roasted malt finish. A little too much carbonation. It takes away from the flavor. Otherwise pretty good.

Yet again, how have I not yet tried this beer? An absolute classic, especially amongst the early craft beers. From what I have read before, I was under the assumption that this was actually an English Porter, which I tend to enjoy a little bit more than their harsher American counterparts. Anyways, I’m excited to finally try this, no matter what it is

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here strikes a balance I really like between burnt bread and sweeter malt. I’m picking up on aromas of roasted barley, dark bread, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate malt, and very mild earthy hops

A slightly less delicate balance is achieved in taste, leaning more into the bitter and roasty side of things. As I said, this is not particularly my preference, but it is well done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark roast coffee, roasted barley, herbal hops, dark chocolate, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark bread, doughy malt, light raisin, herbal hops, and milk chocolate

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a biting yet smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slowly expanding sweetness

This is crafted beautifully. While not the most impressive porter I’ve had, the execution is just incredible. I need to get this more often"
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.4,"Dark brown with a foamy tan head. Aroma of dark malts; cocoa, chocolate, coffee, nut, caramel. Nice dry Porter flavor. Slight bitterness. Finishes really clean. Nice medium body. A delicious example of a Porter."

Tan head above a deep. dark brown but clear beer. The head slumps quickly to a ring and film.
A swirl kicks up the foam and allows the sweet charred grain aromas out. Molasses and maple, campfire and singed spruce tips.
Rich flavors of grilled cherries and leather, scorched sugar and red wine tannins. Just on the edge of sour notes move in mid swallow, slightly astringent bite at the back. Sweet and dry the hops lend a firm bitterness to the smokey malt base.
Body is light - medium - rich in flavor not heavy in body.
A classic Porter bordering on robust. Obviously not a fresh bottle yet still more than enjoyable."
Popular,Anchor Porter,4.38,"(355 ml bottle). Pours with a large tan head, colour is very dark, nearly black (= very, very dark ruby when held to the light). Lovely complex aroma where coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, oak and sandalwood shine through. Flavour is initially sweet and mellow, then a distinct bitterness comes through. Coffee notes are dominant. There's something undefined strange in the aftertaste that keeps me from giving it a straight ""5"". Still, this is a top class porter!"

Popular,Temptation,4.04,"Poured from 12.68 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.

Look- Pale gold, very hazy, no visible particulate, sudsy white head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- White grape, oak, chardonnay, mildly brett.

Taste- White grape, chardonnay, sour finish.

Feel- Thin body, clean finish, very dry finish, sourness induces saliva, gentle carbonation.

Overall- A wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics. This is a large descent from the beer styles I typically drink, but was an enjoyable new experience."

Beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head.

Nose is very nice, a nice combination of horse blanket, white wine, and a touch of sourness.

Taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather. Finishes very dry and oaky.

Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with each sip.

Overall a sour that is very well done and does not obliterate my sour sensitive palate!"

Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper

The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather

A light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes quite dry and funky

The taste follows. Lemon, pineapple, orange, and oak. Low to medium tartness.

The mouthfeel opens medium and finishes dry. A touch too dry in my opinion.

Overall, very good. Delicate and complex. My one knock is that it leans bitter and dry on the finish, which undercuts the fresh fruit notes that are so prominent on the nose."

Popular,Temptation,4.94,"RR beers are incredibly difficult to find on the East Coast, especially in PA, where (according to one source) they are randomly distributed. Was very excited to discover a few dusty bottles dated 050118 at Waywood Beverage in Kennett Square, PA. Opened on 1-10-20 and poured into a champagne flute.

A: Clear straw gold. Rocky white head that settles quickly. Some lacing remains after letting the beer open up for a minute.

S: Strong lactic sourness. Vinous white wine notes followed by golden raisin. Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose.

T: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay.

M: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation).

O: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body. This is an elegant and quaffable beer, with just enough funk and acidity to be rustic and refreshing and not toilet stall and corrosive."

Popular,Rübæus,4,"A: Poured from the 12 oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a dark red color that is clear when held to light. Head is foamy, off-white, and 2 fingers with moderate retention.

S: Sugary raspberry jam with a bit of bread and pie crust to hold it together. Not complex, just fruitiness and a bit of pie. Not that that's a bad thing...

T: A bolder, juicer flavor than I was expecting. This isn't quite in your face but the taste is all raspberry all the way through and has a lot of character. There is a certain something holding it together, so it's not just juice and it's not a sugary mess.

Overall: More elevated and drinkable than I thought. I was picturing a sort of lambic, but this is not tart at all. It has a pleasant juiciness to it, and it feels like a nice summer drink."

Simple and tasty is what it is about."
Popular,Rübæus,3.88,"Clear pour with pink and raspberry tone. Impressive white head with light pink shade. Lacing was good. Aroma was nothing crazy, but with tad hints of raspberry. Most likely due to puree mix. The taste was dominated by raspberry, but not overwhelming. I also tasted tart and malt. Moderate carbonation with light body. Surprising smooth. Only 15 IBU and reasonably priced. Fruit beers are easy to mess up, but the overall balance presented well for me."

Nose is very nice; banana and clove are very prevalent.

Taste is a light wheat malt base that allows the yeast to show forth the yeast properties that give forth banana, bubblegum, and a touch of cloves. Finishes balanced but lacking a burst as the flavor kind of falls away.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth.

Overall a very nice hefe!"

Popular,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.96,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle

The look is just a touch lighter than an amber, with a decent haze but you can still see through it pretty well, translucent I guess. Pretty decent carbonation but not the most intense. It's an attractive beer for sure. Head is less than one finger on the pour but retention is very impressive maintains a fine cap for as long as there still iGerman. No lacing though.

Aroma is obviously very yeast forward with strong banana orange smells almost like a wit beer but just malt and hops. In the back a nice dry malt aroma.

Flavor follows the aroma but less orange notes and more dry fermentation notes. A light acidity going on here. A light malt aftertaste rides along with some banana chip notes for a clean very vaguely bitter finish.

Feel is all from the head bringing a nice creamy mouthfeel from fine bubbles, but still light enough to be a nice warm weather beer. Also has a big enough body to bring it to year round status.

Overall a nice traditional hefeweisen pretty balanced and as usual not a lot of hops. Not sweet but not bitter a nice yeast and malt beer here good if you just want something actually german."

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

This one takes a sweeter approach in the nose that I quite enjoy. I’m picking up on aromas of banana, sweet honey, bready malt, pear skin, bubblegum, and earthy wheat

While this tastes pretty good, I think it may be overly fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy wheat, banana, orange zest, doughy malt, and clove. The swallow brings notes of banana, raisin, bubblegum, earthy wheat, bready malt, pear skin, and light herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry but again the fruity notes shine too much

Despite my one nitpick with this beer, it is delicious. A nice session beer"
Popular,Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.89,"Poured from the can, the look of this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Opaque, thick looking beer with a thick creamy white head, lines of bubbles rising from the bottom, streaking you the brownish-red body of the beer. Striking look in the glass.

The smell is a strong point for the beer, mild banana, orange peel citrus notes, backed by a malty-bready smell.

The taste is where a lot of the really highly rated beers on here fall a bit for me. I won’t deny that it might simply be my expectations are too high. Despite that, the taste is still phenomenal compared to almost all beers out there, it’s just relatively straightforward. Citrusy clove taste that waxes and wanes with a very mild peppery taste. Very sweet wheat taste, though not as powerful as the smell would indicate. A little creamier than other weissbiers! Which I enjoyed. Plentiful carbonation without too strong of a bite makes it taste very smooth and creamy.

Love that malty wheat flavour on the exhale"

This is a great beer."
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,1.83,There are much better winter warmer beers out there. The look is unappealing - just dark with no sparkle. The taste is all malt and there is little spice character and the aftertaste is medicinal. Spend the extra money on a better beer.
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.78,"Clear deep reddish-amber, with about 1/2"" of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring and surface sheet of foam.

Smell is toffee, caramel, light biscuity malt, and hints of nuts and (moist) dried fruit. The overall aroma is good, but quite light.

Taste is mostly a light mix of toffee, caramel, raisin, and cooked nuts, with brief flashes of orange rind, clove and, nutmeg, finishing with a general light spiciness (coriander & black pepper) that lingers a bit.

Feel is medium, barely-slick, with moderate, moderately-bitey , fine carbonation.

Winter warmers are not among my favorites - more of a once-in-awhile-in-the-right-mood thing - but I'd put this among the top echelon of those. I used to get a 6er or 2, when you could do that, but at this moment, the 2 in the 12pk is plenty. Good while it lasts, but that's plenty enough. :)"

Not great, but still pretty good. Not as rich and heavy as most winter warmers, but the flavors are well blended and it is easy to drink. I wouldn't go out of my way to find Fezziwig, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."

12 oz. bottle dated 294 1 (10/21/21) - 5.9% ABV / 25 IBU
Brewed and bottled in Breinigsville, PA?
Poured into a Bell's branded nonic pint glass

Look - Pours a dense, off-white head that clings to the glass. Clear, brownish red appearance with a lot of streaming bubbles.
Smell - Picking up mostly caramel and toffee on the nose. The spices become more prominent as it warms.
Taste - The initial taste is caramel and toffee with the ginger and orange peel lingering in the background. Can't detect much of the cinnamon, and has some very slight bitterness on the tail end.
Feel - Has a somewhat thin and crisp mouthfeel and finishes slightly dry.
Overall - Not huge on flavor, but it's pleasant and easy to drink."
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.94,"From a 12oz bottle dated ""Enjoy before"" April 2022 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent very dark reddish brown with about two fingers of tan head. Decent retention, great lacing.

The smell doesn't really let loose until the beer warms a bit. Getting some nice spices-cinnamon, nutmeg. A little caramel and dried tart fruits.

Taste follows the nose almost identically. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate.

Quite smooth drinking. Mild cinnamon aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Spiced beers really aren't my thing, but this one is really well done and I'd drink again."
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.72,"Pours dark brown. Decent head that hangs a bit.

Dry finish. A little astringent. Keeps ya coming back.
Good beer. Nothing special"

Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.22,"The star of the holiday variety pack! I really wish it actually had a little fruitier flavor. Light malt, yes light malt, slightly fruity. Idk why but it tastes slightly plastic like. They smell is fantastic. I wish I liked the flavor more but to me it needs to be stronger. Not in the bitter sense, but the fruit I guess. For such an iconic holiday brew the flavor needs to set itself apart more. I'll grab one of the two in the box, but in a six pack? Nah. Holiday nostalgia"
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.81,"12oz bottle. Label is notched to indicate best before April of 2021.
Deep amber colored body. Thin finger of off white head, further recedes to a partial cap. Leaves some bands of lacing on the non-drinking side.
Aroma of dark malts with toffee. Also expresses spices of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.
Taste is a mix of the dark roasted malts and the spices. Has toffee from the malts. Has spices of black pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. All quite subtle, but the aftertaste brings the spices into the nose.
A little thinner than medium mouth feel. Very little sweetness nor bitterness. Mostly a savory presentation. Good carbonation.
Good beer to sip during the colder months. Not bold in smell nor flavor, but pleasant enough as an alternative to a basic porter or if a truly spiced holiday ale is too much."
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.81,"L: Ruby brown body, pretty light head.
S: Rich caramel malt, sweet, slightly alcoholic, notes of cinnamon and allspice, a bit of cherry.
T: Some dark fruit- plum and cherry, sweet caramel, citrus notes, hints of spice, and a bready finish.
F: Very crips, high carbonation, lightly syrupy.
O: Tastes like the big brother to their winter lager. I dig the dark fruit and caramel, though there isn’t as much spice present in the body as I had hoped. Still, really enjoyable."
Popular,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.5,"It's back! 11/5/2021

L: Very red, with some brown.
S: Up the nostril, took in some heavy gingerbread, spice, I wish I knew my spices better, nutmeg? Even some sweetness.
T: Unique spice taste. Clove, molasses gives way into spice, then ends with a bit of a bitter tinge to them at the end, not really a light metallic, have a feeling it's the spices. Followed by a sweet malty and bitter aftertaste.
F: Good carbonation. Not watery at all in my opinion, no sticky mouth feel. Not sure what this other guy was talking about unless he heated his up haha."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.31,It says it’s an Imperial IPA- but I don’t really get the flavor I expected. Very sticky with pine resin and citrus. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. I honestly expected more pine and hop bitterness for an imperial. However- I really do like this. Another great offering from Troegs.
Popular,Perpetual IPA,3.54,Pours a clear gold. Thick foam. Light hoppy aroma. Heavy hop body. Strong bitterness. It persists. Kind of bland. Not a lot of character. Not bad but could be better.

AROMA: Floral hops, citrus of mandarin orange, pine resin. Bread malts are also evident.
TASTE: Drying and some hop bitterness up front. Bread malts balance. Drying thru the finish.
Very solid, IPA"
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.55,"Pours from can very clear, like apple juice. Head is almost the brightest white I have seen in a beer with nice lacing. Nose is piney and citrusy.

Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.16,"Excellent beer! My only thing is it smells pretty funky. Other than that, super rich and complex taste. Beautiful harmony between the malt and hops, nice and clean feel. This well deserves a stand out spot up there in the ever expansive world of IPA's, and for all the right reasons. Perfection, take notes people"
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.06,"I used to love this IPA. If fact, it was one of my favorite. But something has changed. It no longer has a ""Hop Forward"" style. Consequently it has a more noticeable malt taste. Along with the high ABV, the taste no longer has a WOW factor. Sad to see this once great beer for hop heads become what it has. Now I'll order other west coast IPAs instead."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.12,"Pours golden yellow with a 1.5"" white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.

Excellent grapefruit & pine taste with underlaying notes of caramel. Resinous.

Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.

Another very good DIPA form Troegs."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.42,"Crystal clear golden color with a bone white head that laces the glass beautifully. The nose is straight citrus and resiny pine, definitely in the WCIPA style.

The taste has citrus up front, with grapefruit rind and ripe oranges, then the resiny pine closes the taste with a very nice bitter finish that is very dry.

This is the very definition of crushable and would always be in my beer fridge if I had regular access to it. Highly recommended if you like the WCIPA style, which I do."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.04,"Beautiful medium amber with a sticky, clotted head of white foam. Great lacing and persistence keeping the beer capped from beginning to end.
Hop aromas fill the room upon pouring. Grapefruit, lavender and sage mix with bread dough and honey in an inviting mix of smells that draw you in by the nose.
Light sugars up front are followed by sharp hop flavors of more citrus rind, bitterness comes in quickly washing most of the malt character and body away.
Highly attenuated and light on the tongue this is a hop showcase and offers only a hint of balance, but thats almost enough.
Very drinkable with a mild, lingering hop bite on the finish.
This is a weak Imperial IPA that lacks malt body,flavor and balance. It is in my opinion and decent IPA, as 7.5% is not quite Imperial level and the grain and malt presence is overshadowed sharp hop flavors .
Happy 4-20!"
Popular,Perpetual IPA,3.24,"Another variety pack for me and this one's first in line. It pours clear gold with minimal head. The smell is piney with minor citrus notes coming through. I'm not getting much citrus in the taste. It's very hop-forward with about 25% mild herbal hops and 75% pungent bitter hops. Clear appearance, but murky flavor. Very smooth and easy-drinking though."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.19,"The beer doesn't look notable in any particular way, but does not look bad. It is sweet, but dank and grassy and piney on the nose. The taste is bitter with a sweetness pooping in towards the end. The hops notes a very herbal, bright, and fresh with some dank. The mouthfeel is soft and foamy. it is pleasant. Overall, it s pretty good beer."
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.17,"Best By 04/14/2021 Let warm for ~10 minutes, before opening.

Clear gold, with 1.5 fingers of medium-coarse ivory head, that leaves a few spots of lacing.

Smell is light pine, a vague citrusy mix, and a bit of (bread)crusty malt. Also some melon and pear from the open can. Smells good, but overall is a bit subdued.

Taste is mostly pine and grapefruit rind, with a little grass & green onion, and a light, helles-like, honey-on-toasted-grain element , near finish. Moderate bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, barely slick, with moderate, soft, semi-creamy carbonation, that finishes slightly drier, and with a mild bite on the tip of the tongue.

Overall , a pleasure. First time having this not-old, and won't be the last (I hope). An old(ish)-school type of IPA, but the feel of it pushes it above most. Dangerously easy-drinking. (On to #2 , as I'm typing this. ;) ) Give it a try if you like that sort of thing. :)"
Popular,Perpetual IPA,4.51,"this is my second favorite ipa next to dogfish head 90 minute . it's just as good except dogfidh head has a better mouth feel, a creamier feel. other than that troegss perp ipa is an Olympic gold metal winner with a perfect hoppy smell that beats better twice the price. i especially prefer the cans because they are never skunked. it tastes especially good in a regular 12oz beer glass whereas dfa 90s is better out of a beer snifter."

Popular,Hop Wallop,4.5,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I have not reviewed this before, have probably had a case of this. Miss this beer."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.96,"A smooth drinking IPA that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. The head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. The beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. The taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes, but with some tropical fruit notes too. This definitely packs a wallop at 7.5%, but does drinks more like a session. Could definitely have more than one, but I would not advise, as the alcohol could sneak up on you. Enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted IPA!"
Popular,Hop Wallop,4.85,"I’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a Hop Devil. It is still one of my favorites. Great flavor, color, nose, and flavor. Victory excels again."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.47,"Appearance:
Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.

Bouquet:
Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.

Feel:
A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.

Taste:
Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.

Overall:
Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for."
Popular,Hop Wallop,4.28,"Pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. Heavy lacing to end.

Strong aroma of pine, grapefruit, earthy, floral.

Taste is resiny, pine, slight spiciness, including pepper.

Medium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

This is a damn good IPA! One of the best."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.83,"Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now.
Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy.
The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there.
The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry.
The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry
Overall, not for the faint of heart, this is what old school DIPA's seem to have started out as. This is one I would come back to preferably for me."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.7,"From a 12oz bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/20. Pours a golden translucent yellow with about two fingers of white fluffy head. Moderate retention, decent lacing. Smells of fresh cut grass. Not picking up much else. Taste is similar to the nose. Grassy and bitter. Mouthfeel is dry with a bitter aftertaste. This a palate wrecker. Overall, not picking up the fruitiness described on the label, but it's not awful. Pretty much a hop bomb. Price point is favorable as well, less than $11 for a 6er."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.17,"It pours clean, retains a slight head with fine lacing, looks decent, gold with very few particles, it smells nice and naturey but I couldn't taste anything! Nothing except a very slight sour pinch from tropic fruits and tiny bit of bitter. Interesting... For a beer that has ""Hop"" in the name I figured it'd be like most IPA's but this one is extremely unusual. I guess it's ok, goes down easy and has high ABV. Hell, I'd try it again just to see if it really doesn't have any taste."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.67,"big fan of the brewery but this one is not fully working for me. i haven't had this one in a few years and i think they made some changes that i don't find
L: looks fine
S; some citrus and grass
T: this is where it goes awry for me. strong lemony taste that is just distracting. all i get beyond it is the bitterness. just not a pleasant combination.
F: smooth with medium carbonation
O: sorry - i wanted to like it much more but i'm not feeling it."
Popular,Hop Wallop,4.06,"12oz bottle enjoy by 06 May 2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber with abundant off white head. The head slowly settles to thick cap leaving the glass covered in lacing. The aroma dank and earthy predominantly with notes of citrus and pine underneath. The taste is more of the same with citrus and pine given the heavy hitting Simcoe punch over a pleasant light malt body. Heavily bitter throughout (no surprise). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good, but not in my taste preference. I'm not a big Simcoe fan and it dominates this beer IMO. Still very well made and a nice reminder of this beer blowing my mind years ago."
Popular,Hop Wallop,3.93,"Pours a semi translucent light honey color with a foamy white head , which dissipates quickly. Smell is reminiscent of citrus,mild toffee, (never used that description for an IPA), hay and earth. Taste is some fruitiness and some dank earth flavor.Mildly astringent. Surprised at the large malt bill, hops get washed away too quickly by a malt rush. (Uneven?) Feels well carbonated, medium body,finishes juicy. Overall if it did not have such an edge the malt bill could be reduced in my opinion. Seems the added malt was necessary because of the beer's astringency. Definitely get walloped by the hops. Good beer"

Beautiful classic appearance of clear and golden ale with a big foamy white head that sticks around.
The aroma is not overpowering, but very pleasant of citrus and tropical fruit and some biscuit

This is a superb IPA and the price point is fantastic at $10/six."
Popular,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,2.24,"Medium orange hue; very see-through. Obviously filtered.

Noticeable bitterness & hop aroma in the nose.

Nice white head, good lacing throughout.

As for the taste...where did the hops go?! They're in the nose but vanish on the tongue. Tastes very much like a lager to me. This has 3 months left on it's 'best before' date, so can't blame it on age.

Watery, with no discernable flavor. A touch of bitterness on the back end, but hardly noticeable. After an interesting nose, this macro falls way flat."
Popular,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,3.65,"From notes 3/6/13: Pours bronze amber producing 1.5 inches of frothy, beige, moderately lasting head that recedes to leave nice sheets of webby lacing. Aroma is fresh and hoppy with pine, earthy herbal and citrus notes with a caramel malt background. Taste is same with a heavier malt backbone with a lingering bitter aftertaste."
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.03,Friend of mine went to Wisconsin and brought this back. Poured into a snifter as recommended and immediately caught the whiff of the cherries. This followed with the sweet and tart flavor of cherry and some hint of the bitterness on the finish. Expected more of the oak like a Cabernet but none to be found. Overall a great beer for it's kind.
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.36,"Pours a solid burgundy with a firm haze / fog to the transparency. Head is two fingers of fluffy off-white foam.

Aroma is big cherry with a ripe fleshy quality. Cherries lean mostly sweet, but possess a slight funky tartness at the back. The only other dominating note is red grape, which comes in at the mid-way point, lingering through the finish. It adds a jammy sweet note to the mix. Despite the listing of numerous sweet notes, the aroma remains well balanced, with a mild funky twist at the end. It's not a lactic sour, jaw tensing sourness, instead, a playful nudge back to balance.

Flavor profile is fresh cherry right out front. It's sweet, plump, and carries a very light funk to it. The back of the flavor profile is adorned by red grapes. The rest of the mix is green apple, pear, lemongrass, cellar stone, and herbal and medicinal hops. There is a twist of cough drop syrup cherry at the back, which is the detriment to each sip. It's lead with sweetness, which carries through the whole profile, being countered right at the end by a twang of funky sourness. It's not overtly sour though, acting just enough to tip the scale from sweet to balanced.

Mouth feel has a crisp texture adorned by a consistent, tight effervescence. It has a medium effervescence, neither hard, nor soft. Thickness is medium as well.

Overall, a delicious beer driven by cherries. It remains remarkably well balanced, despite leaning on the sweet fruit of cherry to flavor it.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours a nearly-opaque deep garnet red, and forms a couple fingers of off-white foam with decent retention.

S: Sweet and laden with plenty of cherry.

T: Follows the nose precisely. This drinks quite sweet, with just a hint of subtle tartness to offset that as it moves along. It is rich with cherry flavor, and manages to be so without veering even slightly into medicinal territory. There are some soft woody notes in the backdrop, alongside some faint malt.

F: Medium and sticky.

O: A delight."
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.42,"If you like fruity beers or ciders, this is awesome. Deep cherry tartness, with a hint of what tastes like gingerbread and smooth maltiness. Almost sweet but not at all cloying."

Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.35,"Cherry, cherry, and cherry! In some beers, that can be overwhelming and even cloying, a touch medicinal - like cough syrup. That's not the case here. The cherry flavors are huge, but natural and balanced, not unlike biting into a ripe, semi-sweet cherry.

The cherry notes are balanced by a very light but noticeable sourness; the cherries themselves aren't overly tart, but combined with the mild sourness of the beer, it creates a lovely overall experience. Additional tasting notes of oak and vanilla.

This beer is 100% as advertised, and delicious."

This beer pours mahogany with some rust colored highlights when held to the light. It is topped with a minimal tan head that leaves spotty lacing.

Wonderful tart cherry aroma. I also get some maraschino cherry. Cherry juice. It smells a lot like cherries.

And I thought it smelled like cherries. the taste is a cherry medley. I get tart and sweet cherry flavor. Very subtle acidity.

Medium bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel

Pure cherry goodness. I am amazed at how well this beer held up for 8 years. I was worried I held onto it for too long. Fears have been allayed. Great beer. Sad that I have no more now."
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.57,"12oz bottle, no date (but from 2021) served in a snifter.

Appearance: Clear ruby red color with a thin off-white rocky foam. Lots and lots of fine strands of lacing all over the glass.

Smell: Tart fresh cherry and a bit of underlying floral aroma. Very nice.

Taste: Tart cherry perfectly balanced with sweet malt and a mildly bitter finish that complements the whole thing. Some additional fruity esters noted in all of this.

Mouthfeel: Slick, very nick thickness, a bit sticky, light carbonation, but it works with the overall character of this beer.

Overall / Drinkability: Very very nice. I want to pair this with a dessert, but by itself it's a great beer. I can see why this beer is rated so highly. Definitely does fit the profile of a Belgian ale, and not exceedingly tart or sour - just right all around. Well done!"

Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.2,"From a bottle. Pour has a very thin layer of white foam that leaves some wisps behind floating atop a vibrant clear and red body. Scent is cherry forward with notes of the wine/barley pairing and the long cask time lingering on the nose. Taste is a fascinating journey: cherry sweet/tart flavors bounce around on the nose, a bit of carbonation erupts on the tongue, and lingering and muted wine-like tastes are evident. Feel is medium bodied, at times on the heavier side, with a phenomenal aftertaste of cherry sweetness welcoming another quaff. A very interesting brew!"

Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,"Review 1499

I have wanted to try this beer for quite some time now. I finally have the chance to try this beer, thank you, Jay, much appreciated. The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average.

The initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out.

The flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical.

The mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish.

Is this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly. I wish I had many more in the fridge."
Popular,Wisconsin Belgian Red,3.87,"Nice rich red that's got some brown to it. Dirty head that sticks to the sides, before retreating to swirl and ring.

Nose is boldly sweet cherries. Candied cherries. It's just straight candied cherries. Maybe a hint of spices (clove, cinnamon), but through and through this is sweet sweet cherries. Not quite maraschino, but almost. The missus loves it. It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like.

Thankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here.
The flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.

As stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe.

This is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.

Much gratitude to @FBarber for sending this along my way during NBW BIF #13! Thanks Frank!"

Pitch black; no light shall pass.

Nice dark tan head; thick lacing.

Smells of a delicious mocha latte; hint of booze. Enticing.

Thick, heavy mouthfeel.

Dark chocolate slaps you in the mouth on the first sip; coffee hits you on the back end.

This feels and tastes like a delicious chocolate malt. One of a kind."
Popular,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.5,"Still love this beer. First had in 2016 from the bottle (4.75*), then in 2017 (4.5*), then a 2016 in 2018 (3.75*). Maybe my palette has changed over the years, resulting in the lowered rating or maybe it's me aging the beer, but it's still one of my old favorites that I'll continue to buy."
Popular,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.29,"On tap. Pours a satin black with a multi finger, tan head that lingers and leaves lacing. Nose of espresso and roasted malt.

Another great Yeti. Great Divide does these magnificently."
Popular,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,3.74,"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, sipped for an hour and a half

Look - Thick motor oil black, with a beautiful milk chocolate brown half finger head. The lacing on this beer is thick, top notch.

Smell - A wonderful whisky up front, with notes of vanilla and espresso and some chocolate

Taste - A nice roasted espresso with hints of chocolate and vanilla. A suprising bitterness likely accentuated by the espresso beans helps cut the maltiness. As it warms, the espresso really comes through and takes center stage, almost too much.

Feel - This is a thick and chewy beer, definitely a nice slow sipper.

Overall - This is a good strong stout. Pretty standard in terms of big bold flavor, however I felt the bitterness was a bit too prevalent as this stout warmed. It would have been a bit more agreeable if was slightly sweeter. Still very enjoyable, no doubt."
Popular,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.8,"This is one of the best coffee stouts that I ever had. This is up their with your Mikkellers, Deschutes, Avery, Founders, New Holland, Oskar Blues, & Firestone Walkers of the beer world. Due to the oak aging that coffee is going to last longer than usual which is a good thing if your sitting on a bottle that is somewhere between 6 months to 1 year old. The 6 pack of highland black mocha stout that me & friend drank was blown out of the water by this beast. This blows the others from the oak aged lineup out of the water as far as I'm concerned. This is as good as any coffee stout that I have ever had. It's a little pricey but worth every dime spent, a World Class stout for sure. Cheers! A"

Popular,Negra Modelo,3.27,"This is my go-to drink but while it has a good molasses and honey dark beer flavor, it is still too bloody sweet to enjoy on a regular basis. For that reason, I tend to mix this with a light IPA for a primitive black 'n tan, but if you go to some random bar or pub it is a good beer to order that will not make you ill and if nothing else tastes too much like the chocolate chip cream cake you got for desert."

I chose this beer as an alternative to the many high alcohol draft options I faced. This oscura beer is a fairly straightforward example of a generic dark lager.

Popular,Negra Modelo,3.31,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by Nov 2022

On the pour a 2 finger head forms, which gradually recedes to a thin covering over the top of the beer. Color is a dark brown/copper to amber. Very lively carbonation. Some lacing tries to form but not the best.

Aroma is mostly oxidized lager yeast with some extra malts in from traditional modelo. Some dark notes but no real malt sweetness comes through. Maybe some very very light mexican hops similar to corona but less light struck. Not a lot here.

Taste is more complex than the aroma. Lager feel right at the front of the sip with a slow evolution to a fuller bodied malty flavor with very fleeting and light bitterness. Not really a bitter beer, but not completely hopless. Aftertaste is subtle dark toffee malt, still penetrated by some mexican lager yeast flavors and it slowly fades out to a more bready note.

Feel is light for the style but not a watery beer. Head still gives a good amount of mouthfeel but it's on the lighter side of things. Similar to modelo maybe a bit bigger.

Overall for the brand a decent dark lager but for the style a bit disappointing and overridden by generic lager flavors, especially when drinking from the bottle. Not a bad beer by any means but not a great example of a Dunkel. It was my Cinco de mayo beer since I wanted something more than generic Mexican mass market lager."

Popular,Negra Modelo,3.42,"355 mL bottle from a six-pack bought at the LCBO; dated Nov 26 2021 and served barely chilled. One of a dwindling number of widespread macro lagers that I haven't gotten around to reviewing for one reason or another.

Pours a clear copper-amber colour with some effervescence; gathered atop is an inch of soapy, lumpy, cream-coloured head that dissipates within a couple of minutes. It leaves behind a messy coat of lacing, in addition to a sudsy collar and filmy cap - looks good to me. Subtle aroma of caramelized sugars, with toasted grains and bread; maybe a teensy bit of nuttiness and some metallicity.

It's a serviceable dark lager: a little sweet, but nothing unusual for the style. Toasted grains and lightly caramelized sugars, with doughy sweetness on the back end; just a hint of grassy, herbal hop bitterness on the back end for balance. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and nutty, fading within a moment or so. Medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation that gently prickles the tongue; smooth mouthfeel, not much bite. Fantastic drinkability - I don't tend to consume dark lagers in large quantities, but six of these around a campfire wouldn't present much of an obstacle.

Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. For a Euro-style dark lager, Negra Modelo is average at best - but I can't rightly claim that it was unpalatable, or that there was anything especially wrong with it. If anything, it's one of the better macro lagers I've had in recent years, and easily the best Mexican macro I've tried to date. The main downsides (at least here in Ontario) are the format and price point - in fact, my unwillingness to pay $14-16 for six bottles of macro lager is the biggest reason I've avoided reviewing this until now. I still don't think it's worth that, but the beer itself is nice enough, and worth the tick."

Popular,Negra Modelo,3.75,"Bottle served with a lime at fiesta Mexican a in moab , utah

Notes: Negra Modelo, better known as ""the cream of the beer"", is a Munich-type beer with 5.3º of alcohol that offers a balanced flavor and a delicate aroma of dark malt, caramel and hops.

Today it occupies the first place in sales among dark beers in Mexico. This beer is accompanied by a bright deep amber color, which is adorned with abundant, white and compact foam.

Negra Modelo was introduced in Mexico in 1925 as the dark beer called Modelo, to begin its great tradition. In 2014 it changed its image to a more sophisticated bottle but with the same content.

Ingredients - Water, barley malt, non-malted cereals, hops

Goes well with Mexican food, malty , fresh clean,

Good beer"

Aroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.

Taste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.

I peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.

Hop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so….""A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup."" 7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little.

Popular,75 Minute IPA,4.14,"12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . .
Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.
I will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction."

Taste: Big and malty up front. Then a huge citric and floral hop bite comes in to the body with that distinct dogfish head IPA yeast. I’m not getting any maple here either.

Feel: Too big for 7.5%. High bitterness and sweetness that do not cancel each other out. Good carbonation.

Overall: The maple isn’t there and the IPA is not good enough on its own. I feel like if the maple rich sweetness was there it would help but instead the whole equation gets thrown off with that one missing part. Just okay."

$2.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy golden-orange body beneath a full head of off-white foam. The head retention appears to be pretty good. The aroma is grainy/malty with just a touch of maple syrup, and citrusy, piney, and floral with what I'm guessing are Cascades and/or some other ""C hops"". Hehe, I just looked at the label and it reads ""off-centered art series FEATURING DAN STILES"" - he's a friend of mine. Moving on, the flavor is fuller than the aroma might lead you to believe but it's pretty much the same. It's grainy, bready, and a little honeyish and sweet on the front of the tongue, but the hops and maple syrup immediately step in and transform it. The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt & maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that's there. It's medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It's an interesting beer. It's pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it's completely balanced. It transitions from malty to malty & hoppy, and then finishes drier but not too bitter with just a spritz of alcohol helping out the hops. I drank that REAL quick and I certainly didn't intend to. I've got just a swig and small sip left. The only thing that's let me down ever so slightly is that the lacing wasn't better. It still scores a 4.25 out of 5 though!

Popular,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,"It is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body."
Popular,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.76,"Look... brown, brown, brown, copper and with ample carbonation and a white head. transparent

Taste...Resinous , slick, peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop. Good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color.
Feel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing
Overall...This is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from Celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes.

Popular,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.19,"Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. At this price, it would be hard to pass if I was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave"
Popular,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.99,"This one smells extremely bright and hoppy. It has no trace of malts in the smell.

The taste starts out with a citrussy and dank hoppiness.  Soon after it all turns very beery with a ton of sweet malts balancing everything out.

It feels foamy and smooth in my mouth. It leaves behind a lush and bitter aftertaste.

Overall it's a really good IPA.  It's got a similar taste to other Sierra Nevada IPAs but there's something more full about it. I give it a 4.7 out of 6."

Aroma: Cut grass, rose petals, grapefruit-led citrus notes, floral hops, and bready, rich malt
Taste: Grassiness, a huge flower bouquet, and sharp citrus come crashing in on the palate followed by rose and an awesome, doughy (almost sourdough), bready malt base that tries to keep the hops tethered. Good clean hop bite on the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied but not chewy at all and lighter than both the look and taste would lead me to believe, medium-high carbonation, clean, and mild dryness on the finish
Overall: This is delicious. As both a Sierra Nevada and fresh hop fan, this is an easy one to get behind but it is really tasty and obviously well-made. The wet Centennial hops are very prominent in the taste and aroma (flowers, citrus, grass, and rose) but this beer’s delicious malt base is equally tasty and apparent, even in a beer meant to showcase hops. Reminds me of a fresh hop Celebration Ale but I can tell it’s a fresh hop plus the malt profile is not only different tasting but lighter than Celebration. Outstanding and recommended"

Popular,Pure Hoppiness,4.21,"This is a big, classic West Coast double IPA and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. Juicy, piney, and full bodied while achieving a dry finish.

Smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow.

On the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with.

It’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.

I loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:

By: Tracy Hensley lJudges Rating:

Overall Impression:
18 / 20

A consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“"
Popular,Pure Hoppiness,3.88,"[Original rating 2015-11-19] Bottle. Pours clear dark gold with a thin white head. Aroma is a little citrus, alcohol, grass, malt. Taste is super hoppy, resiny, bitter but with just enough malt to balance it out. Nice thick mouth feel."

Popular,Pure Hoppiness,4.34,"Not sure how fresh this is, as it was on the discount shelf. Pours a clear amber honey with a thick white head that recedes to a thin cap and leaves great lacing. Aroma is orange rind and pine. Flavor is sweet citrusy fruits followed by a bitter pine with some caramel malts in the mix. Feel is a bit heavy but overall a very nice brew. I'd like to try this fresh and/or on tap."
Popular,Pure Hoppiness,4.19,Poured a deep gold leaning toward orange rather than amber. Aroma hits you with exactly what the name told you to expect. Hops hops and more hops. Lota of pine and citrus scents with an inderlyings carmelly malt. The taste is very deep pine with orange rind bitterness. The hop lovers dream beer.
Popular,Loose Cannon,4.19,"Clear, deep amber body under a large white head that left good lacing. Aroma of floral hops standing out against a backdrop of barley.

Popular,Hopsecutioner,3.74,On tap ATL airport. Mostly clear deep orange/gold with short white head leaving scattered lacing in the 20 oz plastic cup. Nose is citrus and sweet malt. Taste follows with more malt and earthy hop notes. Not much bitterness. Doesn't do the name justice.
Popular,Hopsecutioner,3.52,"Appearance: Pours a light to medium, clear, golden color with a moderate white head. SRM of 7-8. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of earthy and dank orange, tangerine marmalade, with some earthy and biscuit malt notes underneath.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of spice citrus, orange, resinous tangerine with a pine soap finish. Mild bitterness, and leans sweet

Feel: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation. Finish is sweet and slightly flat (3.50)

Compared to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA 1/21/22: Pours a lighter color with a milder head. Stronger aromas. More orange, tangerine. Less caramel and spice. A smaller body.

Overall: This one has resinous flavors of orange, tangerine, with somewhat of a soapy/chewy finish. Maybe some hop burn. I think it could use more carbonation. (Final Rating: 3.52)"
Popular,Hopsecutioner,3.92,On tap at Terrapin in Athens. Pours a copper color with a slight head. Not the hops bomb I was expecting. Definitely a combination of grapefruit and pine with the pine winning. But not over the top.
Popular,Hopsecutioner,4.33,"Clear light copper, thick white head, great retention, chunky swaths of lace. Very pretty
Old school west coast aroma: grapefruit, pine, a bit of dank, and caramel

Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. A little bit sticky
Man, I miss these type of IPA"
Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.95,Sixteen ounce four pack copped from Buy Rite in South Orange. Pours a ruddy copper hue with moderate frothing. Very assertive aroma replete with strong notes of white grape and marmalade. Powerful flavors present which burst forth with ridiculous amounts of citrus-laden chewiness. Good stuff. Highly recommended.
Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.75,"A: Two plus finger building head is towering in the chalice, a creamy soft and billowy composition that is light tan in color overlays a darken tangerine color for the body. Bubbly and soapy lace ring. Hazy and dark appearance is dense and shows some macro-carbonation bubbles clinging to the vessel walls. A strong steady stream has a pretty good lasting presence of effervesce.

S: Sweetened grapefruit pulp is juicy and semi-tart along with wet grassy hop notes. Dried peaches and apricot fruit has side notes of orange-citrus upon the close with some mixed fruit presence. Good strength overall, complexity is only moderate.

T: Dank tangerine-grapefruit flavor provides a bittering first bite with a flowery edge. Big grassy dry hopping soon moves in. A touch of soapy hopping is every so slight. Resiny with a flowery bite of hops that really packs a wallop.

M: Resiny mouthful, with a follow of dry flowery lacing on the tongue. Very bitter on the hold. Small carbonation factor that really does not make nor break it either way.

O: Overall 3 Floyds makes some trueley outstanding beers that stand above the rest, unfortunately this is a mere placeholder in terms of the brewery's other accords. While solid in strength with a demanding flowery hop bitterness, I just did not find it contained a lot of complexity or malt attributes. The blunt force of hops most likely drowned out any small and subtle secondary contributions. A very bittering overlay of hops that would surely create entertainment on the noob hop drinker, but comes short in a complete aspect for me for outstanding regards."

Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.37,"This was another beer that I picked up recently at the Whole Foods in Williamsburg. Always enjoyed 3 Floyds as it’s nice to see them available in this neck of the woods again! This was a clear winner as it had plenty going for it as it fit it's ""massive IPA"" description quite nicely, down to the last sip!

The look and feel to this was reminiscent of West Coast beers as it had a gorgeous copper hue to it with a fine haze and a bit of dark sediment floating around in it. Plenty of head topped it off as the lacing was deep, extensive, and beautifully layered all the way down the side of my pint glass. Loads of pine, resin, and grapefruit in the nose along with a bit of Caramel Malt as the taste nicely followed suit. Lots of floral notes that felt like Anchor emerged in the notes as this warmed up with a nice resinous body underneath that. The back had a ton of grapefruit and lemon zest to go along with some sweet malt that almost called for a chaser of water to finish this off, except I wanted the flavor to last as long as possible!

The carbonation was softly moderate and the body was balanced as the booze was not that noticeable. Loved the label on this can as this had a packaging dated of 12/28 on the bottom of the can. Aside from that being barely legible, this was a lovable beast of a beer that easily deserved another go-around. Who knew that one of the best left coast beers came out of Indiana?"

And we're back with another imperial IPA from 3 Floyds. I loved their Permanent Funeral, and I'm hoping that this is in a similar vein. Regardless, I'm always on the lookout for new beers from them ever since they started distributing here in Mass. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

On first whiff, this is a promising beer. It's big and in your face while also being balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of rich caramel, bready malt, juicy orange, resiny hops, apricot, and a touch of honey

There's less of a delicate balance in the taste, but it's still good for what it is. On the front end of the sip the malt dominates and I'm tasting caramel, soft bread, lightly floral hops, and a touch of lemon zest. The swallow bitters up a bit, bringing notes of pithy grapefruit, orange marmalade, fresh pine, herbal hops, and light bready malt

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of warming alcohol

This was very good, but I've had much better from them. Still, I would get it again in a heartbeat if it was my only 3F choice"

t: sweet caramel and strawberries. pineapple and a lot of peach. peach cobbler, orange sorbet, and a nice piney bitterness. sweet melons and honeydew. grass and grapefruit towards the end. little bit of a bready malt backbone. nice hit of bitterness at the very end

m: full mouthfeel, slightly sticky. low-medium carbonation

o: a bit mellow in the flavor with a big hit of bitterness. malts are definitely noticeable, but the bitterness overrides. hops aren't too diversified, but this is a old school DIPA for sure, with more bitterness than i would have thought for a DIPA. Good, not great IMO"
Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.38,"Pours a hazy golden tangerine with two big fingers of head and a plethora of floaties. The nose has pine and earthy notes.

Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.41,"Beautiful deep amber with a tall, rocky, pale doeskin head with everlasting gobstopper like retention. Rim to liquid lace drapes the glass, the nearly red-amber beer is opaque with protein haze but not flocked with suspended oat starch.
The aroma is malt - rich and sweet followed quickly by sugar dusted tangerines and honey dipped pine cones. Yummy jam on toast smells welcome the nose and entice it in for deeper snuffs. The hops could be louder but then the lovely malt would be lost. 3F's knows what they're doing.
The taste is again malt up front with a rush of hop flavors and bitterness on it's heals. More honey notes coat the tongue and help soften the barrage of hop flavors and bitter bite. Fruity flavors of pear and grapefruit mix with the spruce and pine needles and green grass notes all smothered in that honey - caramel malt sweetness in balanced complexity achieved by only the best of brewers.
The malt liquor aspect comes through at the finish which is dry and warming with a nice lingering alcohol and hop aftertaste. The priming sugar addition detracts from the overall mouth feel maybe and only offers tasteless alcohol to the mix.
The body is shy of full and the alcohol hides as I said , till the very end. A bit over dry on the back end.
Highly drinkable, superbly balanced at least up front and, in the end, extremely satisfying."

Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.19,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/28/20, so 5-6 weeks old.

Actual hazy burnt orange/marmalade colored body. Small bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering, leaving interesting lacing.

Lightly hoppy aroma.

On tasting, pretty aggressive beer. The malt sweetness is detectable, but merely serves as a platform for an all out (panzer) assault of bitter grapefruit and pine hops.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a slightly sweet strong grapefruit hit to the palate.

Overall, after an initial shock, this one really grew on me. Excellent old style DIPA. Happy to have another 3 in the fridge."

Popular,Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.56,"Can purchased at One Stop Beer Shop in Greece, NY.

This one pours a light amber/dark orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells supremely resinous, with stone fruit, orange peel, piney hops, with an almost burnt aroma.

I've been wanting to try this one since basically 2014, and it's finally available to me locally. It's an uncompromising old school bruiser. The taste is placed firmly back into the IBU wars of yesteryear, with a bit piney/grassy/pithy biterness, with bitter grapefruit, orange peel, and some slightly compromising stone fruit/orange sweetness. A lot of people wouldn't like this in today's juice bomb day and age. To me, it's a really great look back in time, and it still holds up for me today.

This is a slow sipper due to the intense pithy bitterness here. As it warms, bitterness retreats slightly, with a bit more fruity hop character. There is nothing ""juicy"" about this one.

I was excited to hear this was one in town on shelves, and it's met my expectations from back in my old money days. This was a great West Coast style IPA."
Popular,Blackout Stout,4.5,"I love this beer period, from the dark rich color to its smooth mouth feel, It's one of my seasonal favorites. I went so far as to buy a sixtel and Put it on tap in my bar. It was then I found the fatal flaw. While me and all my friends were enjoying this if it became apparent that there was a 4 drink maximum, as anything beyond that seem to have everyone ready for a nap. That 9% is a bit heavy for more than light drinking. So while I still love it I'll enjoy it in smaller quantities."

O: Haven't had this one since it was first released, before I was on BA, so it's nice to get to try it again. Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. That said, it does have a bit of the trademark session IPA watery-ness, and there are other session IPAs out there with a bit more balance and flavor.

It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much.

Popular,Go To IPA,3.75,"I was given this can by my cousin as a gift but since I have such a backlog here, it took me a while to get around to this. Canned on 10/26/17 with enjoy by date of 1/24/18 printed below it, I did not have this fresh but did keep it cold until I cracked it open today. It's been a while since I've had anything from Stone and although their IPA's were a big reason why I love that style so much now, this one was just a bit underwhelming to me...

The pour was decent as the liquid was golden, fairly translucent, and topped off with plenty of head. Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That's exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren't enough to put this over the top.

Regardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale. Not really feeling this one but because of the age, it's hard to tell whether that was because of my inaction in getting around to this or the beer itself. If you're looking for a ""light' version of their flagship IPA, reach for this and please, consume it fresh!"

Let’s see how it goes down…rather smooth across the palette with a medium mouthfeel. You get a nice dose of pithy citrus up front with some tropical fruits with a good pine bite. The sweet malt follows with a bit of prickly carbonation. As it finishes quite dry."
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.9,"Remember when you were a kid and poured chocolate syrup all over your pancakes at a restaurant? This is the beer equivalent: a nice mellow porter with a rich chocolatey taste, a little bit acidic toward the high end, but thankfully not too sweet and with a bassy bottom note almost like Italian roast coffee. In an age of brands committing suicide by cutting quality, Samuel Smith's has kept on providing one of the best beers out there, even if a bit pricy."
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.74,Incredible chocolate flavor. This is how a chocolate milkshake would taste if it were a beer. Great body and not overly cloying. Definitely worth a try.
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.63,"Phenominal beer. The texture is unbeatable in how bold and full bodied it is. Flavor actually retains some chocolate so it's not just in the name, smells like it too."
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.3,"Black to dark brown body. Quick flash of a brief, short beige head. Highly carbonated and tasty. A nice sipper, a bit of chocolate and smooth malts. The barley is more discernible than the chocolate, to make it clear where the focus is here. But it's well done. Usually when a beer gets to its last few sips it becomes less bearable, but all throughout this beer is of very solid quality and retains good flavor."
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,3.82,"Had this from a bottle.

D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking sweet stout"

Brewers Notes: Brewed with well water (the original well, sunk in 1758, is still in use with the hard water is drawn from 85 feet underground), the gently roasted organic chocolate malt and real organic cocoa used in this ale impart a delicious, smooth and creamy character, with inviting deep flavours and a delightful finish - this is the perfect marriage of satisfying stout and luxurious chocolate that will lead to smiles and refills. Samuel Smith's brews in traditional coppers, uses stone 'Yorkshire Squares' for fermentation, and ships every bottle from the brewery with great pride.

Dark cola brown liquid topped by a two finger creamy taupe crown

Aroma is sweet milk chocolate

Taste is sweet milk chocolate with faint roast malts

Sweet, low sudsing , smooth

Good beer"
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.04,"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint Glass

The beer pours completely pitch black with about two fingers of khaki/tan head that slowly recedes leaving behind a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is overpoweringly chocolate! Once you get past the initial punch of chocolate there are notes of vanilla and roasted malt

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The milk chocolate is complimented with some notes of roasted malt. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and vanilla. Medium/full bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, even if they are a little heavy handed with the sweet chocolate"
Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,5,"Look: Poured from a pint bottle refrigerated temperature - Extremely dark brown pour with strong notes. Can tell it's brown by holding it up to the light and seeing the hints of brown that seeps within this one. About a inch of foam risen to the surface.
Smell: Getting a strong metallic smell as if I opened a Guinness. Maybe it's the way the Irish brew their beers? Noticed this on quite a few Irish stouts before. Especially Guinness. Got hints of metallic, chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end.
Taste: Wow!!!! Got huge notes of chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end. Initial contact was chocolate and the end flavor was the cocoa. Very good!!!!
Feel: Medium bodied beer - Silky smooth chocolaty rich and very delicious.
Overall: I'm going to say this is the BEST chocolate stout I've ever tasted and if you see this in the store - well it's your lucky day if you decide to buy it. I'm going to buy it in bulk tomorrow."

Popular,Organic Chocolate Stout,4.75,"This is a chocolate stout to remember. Samuel Smith delivers a delicious stout that has remarkable chocolate flavor.

L-indeed golden. Cloudy. Minimal head fades rapidly
S-funky with Belgian esters, mineral tones predominating. Less fruit than typical for style
T-surprisingly well balanced given the nose. There is an undertone of yeast and bread, and a flavor led by clean minerals and fruit (banana?) flavors are now present (unlike the nose)
F-smooth, medium bodied, with a little stickiness
O-a successful American beer that gives a successful homage without being a copy."
Popular,Pranqster,4.14,"Poured into a pint glass: color is straw gold, slight haze, head pours 1/2 finger thick and dissipates quickly to nothing except thin ring along the glass side, limited lacing on glass sides.

Smell is Belgian esters, lighter phenols, bubble gum, toast, bread, yeast byproduct, honey and fruitiness from yeast.

Taste is similar with esters, light phenols, Belgian yeast byproducts, bread, candi sugar and some honey, stone fruit, straw, bread/wheat.

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness, drying from the fermentation/finished gravity, then some lingering sweetness.

Overall a very pleasant, sweeter Belgian golden ale - yeast and esters are subtle but enticing, sweetness counters dryness, but still overall an interesting ale."
Popular,Pranqster,3.75,"A decent (strong) Belgian pale, but I found it lacking in any particular (single) strength. Nothing was off but nothing stood out.

Slight taste of rock sugar also threw me off."

12oz bottle served in a snulip. Don't see a date on it. Left about a half inch in the bottle so there's not much sediment in the beverage I'm reviewing. I've had this many times, but not for many years.

Pours a clear deep golden with a smallish head. Collapses into a frothy ring and dusty wisps streaking across the surface. Not much active carbonation. Smell is light banana / yeasty esters, something else in there that I can't put my finger on. Fruity. Maybe pear.

Taste is following along pretty closely, but there's an oaky astringency and a woody bitterness, too, making it much less one-note.

Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, this is a nice beer. As good as I remember it being."
Popular,Pranqster,3.62,"Look: Pale amber liquid with a white head. I was expecting a more robust color for a strong ale.

Overall: I like many strong ales however, this ones not for me."
Popular,Pranqster,4.13,"Orange amber color with a thin off white head. Aroma of fruity esters, banana, clove, and apple cider. Taste is fruity, orange zest and apple cider with a hint of honey sweetness from the malts. Well balanced and goes down clean. Finish is slightly warming with just a mild sour quality. Feel is just slightly oily. Excellent ale."
Popular,Pranqster,4.18,"Minimal head, lovey hazy orange body. Bread, banana, light esters, and light pine aromas. Taste follows suit, with bready malt, mild piney hops that produce a well balanced bitterness, becoming sweet banana and fruit esters, finishing with orange peel and hints of clove. Feel is wet and creamy, and the alcohol is present throughout the sip (though not strongly so).
Fruit, spices, and cream. Nuff said."
Popular,Pranqster,4.5,"A really well done Belgian Ale. Yeasty and sweet, grassy, earthy but enough hops to balance it out. I've been in craft beer sampling for over 10 years now and I can't believe this North Coast beer has missed my radar all this time. I'll really enjoyed it and recommend."

Flavors of malt, candi sugar, wheat, light spices, light Belgian yeast. Smooth, a very good lighter body, well carbonated.

Maybe not top tier for the style, but well made and enjoyable. A fairly classic interpretation of the style that’s worth a purchase at a great price point."
Popular,Pranqster,4.25,"It smells sweet like apples, pears and yeasty bread water. Maybe even a little grapy.

It's as sweet as it smells with the funky yeasts of a Belgian ale.  It's got the taste of wine.

The mouthfeel is thin and really bubbly with carbonation.  The finish is long, clean and fruity with a little bite of bitterness.

Overall it's a very drinkable Belgian ale. I give it a 5.1 out of 6."

Popular,Pranqster,4.56,There isn't much to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. It's good! The dangerous part about it is that it is way too smooth for the ABV. you could definitely be on your behind if you're not careful.
Popular,Pranqster,3.92,"Translucent beer with an unfiltered look. Light head without much lacing. Smell nicely previews the yeastiness that comes about in the front and back of the beer. Taste is smooth and interesting, as the full malty flavor of the ale comes in the front and stays in the back of the mouth throughout. It's a bit overcarbonated for my taste, but that might be a function of me being less familiar with Belgian style ales. Overall a decent beer you should pick up if it's in front of you."

Popular,Pranqster,4.21,"Separating a 4-pack of 12oz bottles. North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin is one of my all time favorite beers. I am excited to mull this over.
Pours a vibrant copper-orange, SRM 8. with an active, mousse-like off-white head, thin. Bubbles are small and fast to rise. There is a bit of cloudiness, but it is still clear. On the nose I get ripened banana and honey grain. Coriander with clove? A blanketing bouquet of flowers. All the notes are rather humble but synergize complexly. It tastes zingy upfront, but very rapidly mellows into sweeter baked goods. Banana again. It almost tastes like a shocktop with added dimension. I swear there are micronotes of coriander and orange peel. Hop bitterness (Saaz) short-lived next to the slurry of malt and corn. It has a body to it, and medium-high carbonation. Oily yet soft.
I am thoroughly impressed with this Belgian Golden Ale. All reminiscent of Belgian styles, softer, sweet bread, subtle ester combinations. It is fruitier, with less caramel, compared to say, a tripel. And not as hefty. Let us not be deceived by the 7.6ABV, I wouldn't have guessed blindfolded, it is much smoother. A yeasty, golden bouquet to satisfy any palate."
Popular,Pranqster,4.14,"Banana, spice, crisp fruits. Pretty much just a boozier, funkier blue moon with an incredibly silky texture. What more can you ask of a strong Belgian?"
Popular,Pranqster,4.11,"pours a hazy pale red-tinged orange body with a small white foamed head that has low retention and leaves only occasional splatters of lacings as it settles to a thin cap with a defined halo

aroma is a floral lush citrus with lowkey Belgian spices (clove, caramelized banana) and obvious nod to Belgian yeast of the barnyard variety

as far as taste goes, the bright, floral and lush citrus form the majority while leaving room for the Belgian yeast, and having a background spice spread that is enhanced by a low grade caramel sweetness. an earthy dose of hop hangs around as well, providing a rounded out bitterness to balance the sweetness of the the citrus.

feel if high carbonation, medium-light body. runs smooth throughout and finishes slightly earthy bitter

overall:
fruit forward with a rustic barnyard Belgian yeast funk and spices coming last along with earthy hop.
it's an agreeable but somewhat funky sipper that keeps the hallmarks of the style but is far closer to a fantastic tribute than being the real deal. that's not necessarily bad, however. just is what it is. I enjoyed it tremendously."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,"Pours a clear reddish-brown color with little head. Scent is of citrus and hops, with the taste surprisingly bitter. Light-medium mouthfeel and an aftertaste dominated by bitter hops"
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.16,"The appearance has a golden amber/maybe closer to a yellow colored body, one finger white foamy head that dissipates and leaves a nice spider web speckled faded looking lacing, light carbonation is seen rising. The smell is slightly sour and/or tart mango/lemon fruitiness up front, hops showing some pizazz. The taste is basically the same adding a bitterness from the hops that seem to be showing a bit more, lemony aftertaste, quick dry finish. The palate sits light on the body, pretty sessionable (perhaps poundable to some). Carbonation is somewhat sharp which is good for the style and I say good to me. Overall, I say this is a good Belgian IPA by style that I would have again."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Wild,3.74,"Not at all what I expected, completely blew my mind. Belgian yeast at the front in the aroma and taste, nice silky body with small soapy head. Nice sharp yeasty finish."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.23,"Very pretty color, orange, full on 5/6"" of white head. Carbonation tight, aroma was interesting, lots of hops hitting those tropical fruit strides. Belgian yeast. This is what I imagine a first tier Belgian ipa to be like in this day and age. Give me some yeasty and hoppy competition.

Taste is both of those with a very dry and welcome finish. Hides the strength so well. A fun beer, doesn't seem to be as plentiful since its first year, but always a welcome addition, I dig it."
Popular,A Little Sumpin' Wild,3.92,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 6 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 8.85%, 1.082 OG and 72.51 IBU. It also note that it was fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain.

Appearance: The body has a deep amber color with a thick cloudy yeast haze. It’s topped off with a quick setting head of off white foam. Only a light thin film covering remains after a minute. Lacing is minimal and slick.

Smell: The aroma has sweet bready maltiness with notes of honey and then loads of pineapple, apple peel, orange peel and some pine like hops.

Taste / Palate: The flavor is full of sweet honey notes inside of a deep bready and yeast like base with waves of different fruity notes. My bottle is fairly well aged so hop bitterness is much lower than a fresh bottle. It also worth noting that the 8.85abv is not noticeable at all. The palate and feel are fairly full and smooth. Carbonation is low."
Popular,Purple Haze,3.5,"Look: Nice color, very interesting looking beer.

Smell: Smells fine, kinda smells like raspberries but not a lot like it. Even though it's a raspberry lager.

Taste: Initial taste is fine at best, after taste is really good, best aftertaste of any beer that i've had, but that's not why we rate beers.

Feel: Fine, nothing special, just fine.

Overall I think this beer is just average, it's good and it's very drinkable, but it's just average."

Popular,Purple Haze,3.44,"this brew isn't incredibly special but it is very recognizable once you've had it. the dark stone fruit tang tinge is barely there, with the malt being the primary taste factor here, but it is a pleasant addition. it could be amped up in the fruit area to really step into something more notable, but as a simple session'r, it ain't half bad, and sure beats any of the bland swill from mega-corps, and they've managed to stay privately owned all this time, so it's nice to support such spunk.
if you want a much more effectively executed fruit-themed brew from them, try the Strawberry Lager if you can find it."
Popular,Purple Haze,2.46,This a watery mess with some subtle artificial raspberry. I'll try it again for more experiences but I really wasn't prepared for it to be this bad to me honestly.
Popular,Purple Haze,2.95,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.69. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Hazy light orange with a two-finger cream head.
S - Wheat-backed floral notes. Berry, but unsure what sort.
T - Whole wheat, grass, and a touch of petunia. Extremely light raspberry note towards the finish. Not bitter at all.
F - Extremely carbonated. Light, crisp, clean. Very refreshing.
O - I've had this beer before on multiple occasions, and I'm happy to review it for the first time [officially]! It's a refreshing brew for certain, with a vague berry aroma and a wheat-filled aroma. Unfortunately, the raspberry flavor doesn't exactly come out as advertised. In a beer where they make it the main attraction, that's not really a great thing. Will buy again on the basis of its refreshing nature for the price, but it's not something to go out of your way to purchase."
Popular,Purple Haze,4.23,"This is a great beer and completely underrated on BA. There is a fruity, berry essence that permeates a sweet, malty backbone, with a slight finish of resiny hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Awesome on the nose and palate. The head and appearance are a little underwhelming, but with a beer that smells and tastes so great, who really cares?"

I'm not a big fan of West coast IPAs.
Some are good. Most aren't.

Now to the Liberty Ale!

Poured a BEAUTIFUL color of a polished piece of amber. Lots of bubbles. Head stuck around for 5+ minutes. Nice lacing! Taste is strictly that Cascade Hops taste, not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. Nice carbonation! Not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like I've experienced with some beers (Rebel Rouser, Ranger IPA, Torpedo). Definitely a nice, refreshing brew.

Overall I think it's a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq."

I really enjoy the hop profile of this beer. To me, Liberty Ale is the epitome of a West Coast IPA. I live in the Northeast and we have an absolutely horrendous assortment of Anchor beer on the shelves at most grocery stores such as Wegmans or ShopRite. Unfortunately, Anchor's sales reps just don't get the job done here in New England.

Every time I'm out in San Francisco I make sure to imbibe on all of the wonderful bruise that we miss out on from Anchor, here in the Northeast."

APPEARANCE: Pours a clear, copper color with one-finger off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a nice looking beer.

SMELL: Sweet bread and flowery, subtle to the nose.

TASTE: Initially sweet honey and then a flowery hop profile that lingered in a good way.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: this is a mild tasting IPA by today's standards but I really enjoyed having it, hard to believe it was being brewed in the dark ages of beer in 1975, I would buy this again no problem and would recommend to anyone who likes craft beer."

T: Classic Cascade hops in their purest form, spicy pine, citrus zest, grapefruit and lemon, floral notes, slightly toasty bready malt, and a pretty much bone dry finish wit only the lightest touch of malt sweetness.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: Was intending for this to be a revisit because I was finally able to find a fresh bottle, but it looks like I've never logged it on here, so...
It might not have all the flash of today's IPAs, but you can see why it grabbed people's attention back in the day and has been brewed ever since. Respect the classics."

Smell: Floral. I can smell lavender and orange peel.

Taste: Begins with a floral hop taste, followed by medium hop bitterness that lingers for a bit. Very mild sweet malt at the back that's hard to detect.

Mouthfeel: Slightly thin, with very high carbonation.

Overall: This definitely feels like one of America's first post-Prohibition forays into the IPA. It's historic, but still lacking the punch and complexity of the modern beverage."

Wondered into the craft lager space a bit this afternoon and while this isn’t a sandbox I love to play in, I took a swing. This is thick, heavy and an absolute loaf of bread in a glass. It has a nice taste, but it’s not something I want more than one of. It’s Boston Lager that’s too heavy and trying to do too much."

Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.52,This lager when poured from Tap has a half inch foamy head. Clear amber color. A sweet hop aroma. A Carmel hop sweet flavor with a slight bitter hop tase over the pallet to counter the sweetness . Great Lakes has a strong winner with Dortmunder Gold Lager!!
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.05,"A - Pours out a clear orange. A white head, with a full persistent cap after the fade. Lots of fine line lacing on the glass as I drink.

S - Strong hit of sour grain, grassy hop notes, and a bit of minerality.

T - A lovely honey note over a soft, undefined apple or pear flavor, with steeped tea acidity and limestone as the sweetness washes away, then a bitter close that skirts the line between pith and aspirin, staying on the right side fortunately and finishing clean.

M - This beer is so drinkable, despite the fairly challenging flavor profile, because it lands light, closes dry, and leaves you looking for the next drink.

O - The style is not one I seek or particularly enjoy, but this beer illustrates why a good lager of this type can be an enjoyable experience that people want to consume while downing pretzels and sausages. Prost!"

O: First dortmunder so nothing to compare it to. I’d like to try more of this style."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,3.84,"Bottle into glass.

L: Deep golden, small but persistent head
S: Very bready, malty.
T: Lots of malt depth, a bit of sweetness and maybe a little fruit alongside the breadiness.
F: Crisp and drinkable
O: Solid entry in the genre. Good beer for summertime."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.2,"On draft at Lavergne's Tavern (Berwyn, IL) 12/30/2021

L - bright yellow, full foamy head
S - malt, bread, spicy hops
T - caramelized malts, sweet bread, a touch of noble hop spice
F - light and clean
O - Great beer brewed to style. This is a perfect sixer on the porch beer."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.04,"Grabbed a Great Lakes variety pack and this is the first one I tried.

It’s golden to amber in color with a limited amount of foam, moderate carbonation, and clear appearance.

The smell is not too strong for me but the malt does come through. There seems to be a hint of citrus as well.

It’s an enjoyable, easy drinking beer that packs a bit more punch than a traditional lager. It has a medium body with no hip bitterness. I’m looking forward to another one."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.12,"Golden-orangeish color. Fresh aromas. Excellent balance of bitterness and sweetness. Very smooth and creamy. I actually like it more on the warmer side, though not quite room temp. Super lager."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.5,"draught
Medium orange, with some caramel and amber overtones, in the appearance. Slightly sweet, medium caramelized malt aroma, with a touch of sweet spice and a tiny noble hop note. Very smooth, touch sweet, lightly spiced, moderately roasted and caramelized malt, with a very subtle, floral, noble hop aspect. Medium, creamy mouthfeel, and a caramelized malt and touch of hops, for the finish. Really good!"
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.25,"This beer brings a unique character to the style. It pours and smells similar to a pilsner. The body is complex, sweet and malty with a delicate finish. A definite regular drinker for lager fans"
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.07,"12oz bottle enjoy by 11/7/21 into a tall lager glass.
L: Pours pure rich gold with a 1"" fluffy, bubbly eggshell white head that goes to thin. Low carbonation with some free-form lacing.
S: Sweet rich caramel, faint malt, esters, white bread, yeast.
T: Sweet rich dark caramel, butterscotch candy, light pine, orange zest, peach, orange cognac, caramelized toasted malts. Fruity hops weave through semi-chewy malt.
F: Extra smooth semi-randy med-heavy mouthfeel with a clean, high-gloss medium length finish. It is lightly drying.
O: Light bitterness stays on top of the broad malt wave to complete a very full flavored clean drinking and overall semi-sweet American Dortmund Gold Lager. Rich and smooth it is very excellent in it's style."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.1,"Pours a ""beery"" looking yellow with a white head that fades quickly leaving a lightly laced glass. Malty aroma with some mild hops, flavor follows with some ""bready"" notes. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied. I didn't think I'd care much for this one. I was wrong."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.55,"Flavorful and refreshing, a long-time favorite summer beer for me. A year round fav, actually. Clear golden color, low to moderate carbonation, nice head dissolves pretty quickly, pleasing lacing, not too much. Moderately alchoholic, high fives. All in all, a superb, restrained brew, that doesn't cry out for attention. But you realize that it deserves attention: perfect balance of malt and hops, (for a lager, that is). To me, the equal of some of the most enjoyable lagers I've had in Germany."
Popular,Dortmunder Gold,4.09,I tended to avoid this because I thought the style was boring compared to others but sometimes you learn to appreciate a well crafted beer of any style.
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Looks dark brown almost black with a nice foamy tannish head.
Smells malty, sweet, chocolate, coffee.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a nice stout that I would definitely drink again."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.99,"RBESG 2006 Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Very nice roasty and hoppy aroma, some sweetish bakery notes in the background. Nice roasty flavour, not overdone, notes of good coffee, hints of dark chocolate. A very good stout in my book."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.4,"On tap at Rogue in Newport. The color is opaque black, with a nitro head and huge frothy bubbles that are retained on a solid crown. The smell is super oaty, sweet, mollasses, cream, and dark rich malt, not much toast. The taste betrays the smell with licorice and rich oats up front, shifting into sarsparilla and rich toasted malt, finishing on a lingering hop notes and mollasses sweetness. Finish wise this is a dry stout for me, and the mouthfeel is thin for a typical stout and finishes moderately dry, which i find interesting.

This is a great oatmeal stout that stands out different from others that rely on heavy cloying sweetness so often. Great job!"
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.1,"A- This one pours a very dark brown color and is fairly hard to see through, but some light does pass. The head is rich and creamy, about two fingers in thickness initially and settles fast into a thick layer of foam above the brew itself. Carbonation appears to be about average for the style, while the lacing is tan colored, with very little in terms of cling around the inside of the glass. Decent looking overall

S- Lots of cocoa initially, which gives way to a slightly soapy tang. Underlying notes of black coffee, grassy/grainy oat flake, dark fruit remnants, dark chocolate nougat malt sweetness, and dare I say a piney quality that reminds me of the outdoors....interesting!

T- There is some citrus peel zest, piney resin and overall this isn't good for the style. Unfortunately, it overtakes the chocolate/coffee/char that I was hoping for. As for the more traditional flavors, they are there, but are all over the place, and are more noted on the finish than rather in the middle of the taste. There is a weird lingering aftertaste that is more of hops than anything. The oat dryness is present and I think this is enhancing what I am not liking about the flavors here, which is unfortunate, as I normally like a good Oatmeal Stout.

M/O- Medium bodied and the carbonation is fairly robust too, providing more of a pale ale vibe than anything. Drinkability is poor for this reason and overall this falls short in what I was expecting this to be. Rogue is generally a favored brewery with its offerings in my opinion, but this is about as interesting and enjoyable as a Shakespearean play. Not good."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a stout glass.

Pours a very dark-brown (nearly black) opaque with a creamy dark tan head that lingers for the last finger, giving way to exceptional foam and lacing.

Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roasted malts, and dark fruits.

The brew hits the tip of the tongue with bittersweet chocolate and hints of coffee and roasted grain. And then---the main event arrives in midstream. BIg oat flavor rises above the din, with the grainy oats blending with some subtle but solid dark fruit flavor. Deceptively hidden grassy and earthy hops augment the coffee and chocolate bitterness and bring it all home.

The brew is just shy of full-bodied, with the grainy oats providing a drying finish. Very drinkable for the style.

Exceptional representation of the style."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.09,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Pitch black, no light passes.

Nice khaki head which dissipates but doesn't disappear.

Strong lacing.

Mild cocoa nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Oats kick in with the taste; hops are clearly present as well.

A lot going on here; the oats & hops mixing creates an odd metallic effect on my tongue. For all that it's really drinkable and certainly unique."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.88,"If you like dry oatmeal stouts, you'll like this one. Rogue makes good stuff, but I expected just a bit more here. It's very oatmeal-heavy, with just a bit of creaminess but not as much as I'd have thought, and a bit of smokiness as well. Yes, it's very dry."
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.36,"(12 oz bottle, 19559... poured into a nonic)

L: relatively high-rise dark tan foam stand on pour; collapses slow, holding a tight, creamy construct; dark brown liquid, reddish highlights... chunky collar and dark tone to foam remains; a few nice wide bands of lace

S: dark chocolate milk, chocolate cake; subtle toasty-roasty and char notes; earthy, woodsy/piney background hop essence... shows a lil old leather as it goes

T: smooth roasted barley wash up front, cakey malt middle, hint of dark coffee in the finish; big robust piney bitter afterburn humming with the charred roast in the aftertaste; back end is relatively dry - majority of sugars express burnt caramelization... roast and bitter last a long time; delicate toffee-ish sweetness builds

F: the bitterness, roast, and ample carbonation fray the ends, balancing out the husky milkiness of its body... alcohol plays real light... feels like a meal unto itself; soft oily, resinous residual film

O: takes me back!... this used to be a regular (bomber-size) swill of mine back in the early aughts - moved on to other breweries, styles... don't see this too often anymore; happened to find this at State Line, thought I'd take a trip down fuzzy-memory lane (1403)"
Popular,Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4,"From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Playing Khimera. Dry and bitter,with soft roastyness and some chocolate and coffee notes.Nice but I expected more smooth and creamy body and stronger flavors"
